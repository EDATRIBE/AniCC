1
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:08,141
[Airi] I think my dad left

2
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:11,411
because he couldn't bear
everyone in town
thinking he was a thief.

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,515
And Mom, I bet her not
believing him either

4
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,317
was really what bothered him
the most.

5
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,521
The whole thing made me want
to stop trusting people.

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,823
I felt like I was being forced
to choose sides.

7
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,660
I thought, if I hated
my mom or my dad,
maybe I'd feel better.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,295
Then a few years later,
I heard my mom say,

9
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,998
"Why couldn't
I just believe him?"

10
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,267
Then I knew she
was miserable too.

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,470
And then,
when I heard her say that,

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,807
I decided to keep on trusting
and loving them both.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,879
I realized that if there's
one thing I'm really good at,

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,848
it's believing in people.

15
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,150

[Satoru thinking] <i>Wha...</i>
<i>What the hell?</i>

18
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,813
[woman] I just saw Airi
go inside.

19
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,250
Then she might be stuck
and can't get out. Hey!

20
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,188
Airi!

21
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,091
Airi, can you hear me?!

22
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,326
Airi!

23
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,629

25
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,369
Airi! We gotta go.

26
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,580
<i>She's heavy.</i>

27
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,721
Hang on, I'll get you
out of here.

28
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,527

Get going out the back.

35
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,713
I got her from here.

36
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,848
Don't get her mixed up
in your shit.

37
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,690

the hero today.

41
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,007

43
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,948

44
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,150
<i>And he was trying</i>
<i>to frame me for it.</i>

<i>wouldn't find the email.</i>

46
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:18,525

<i>Maybe he followed her or...</i>

47
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,695

49
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,400
<i>I'm gonna find him.</i>

[Sawada] Hello? Hello?

55
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,020
All right, who is this?

56
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,422
[Satoru] <i>Satoru Fujinuma.</i>

57
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:54,194
[Sawada] If you're who you say
you are, then nice to meet ya.

58
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,763
I've been expecting your call.

59
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,966
Sure, I'd be glad to.
But not here.

60
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,335
Someplace public.

61
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,939
No, I'm not telling you
who I am just yet.

62
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,674
Tomorrow, when we meet.

63
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,176
'Cause if you're not
who you say you are,

64
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,313
then you're the son of a bitch
that killed Sachiko.

65
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,687
‐[doorbell jingles]
‐[clerk] Sit down anywhere.

66
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:24,057
Oh, hey, Satoru. Over here.

67
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,692
I'm Sawada.

68
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,695
I used to work with your mom
at Ishikari TV.

69
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,464
Goddamn, you look
just like Sachiko.

70
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,668
Yeah, you're her kid,
no doubt about it.

71
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,038
[Satoru thinking] <i>It's him.</i>

72
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,273
I bet you're wondering
if you can trust me.

73
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,075
But there's nothing
to worry about.

74
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,845
I didn't tell the cops
you called and I didn't
kill your mom.

75
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,047
Yeah, well, maybe you think
I killed her.

76
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:50,383
‐[chuckles] Not even.
‐How can you be sure?

77
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,186
'Cause I knew your mom

78
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,189
and I know she didn't raise
the kind of son who'd kill her.

79
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,158
Hmm, I see.

80
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,361
[Satoru] Yeah, I remembered
I had it in my pocket yesterday.

81
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,765
You're in it deep,
that's for sure.

82
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,733
[Satoru] Tell me about it.

83
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,602
And now I'm on the run
'cause I panicked.

84
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,537
I can't stop screwing things up.

85
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:15,008
What happened happened,
so it's pointless to beat
yourself up about it.

86
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,911
That's something your mom
liked to say.

87
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,880
It's kind of appropriate,
don't you think?

88
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,919
You want me to tell you what we
talked about the other day?

89
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,888
[Satoru] Yeah.

90
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,091
[Sachiko] Do you remember
18 years ago,

91
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,694
when that serial killer
was targeting kids?

92
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,496
Yeah, sure. Jun Shiratori's
still sitting on death row

93
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,264
and still denying
he killed them.

94
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:41,467
[Sachiko] <i>Well, Satoru was</i>
<i>right about him.</i>

95
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:46,306
<i>Shiratori's innocent,</i>
<i>and I think I've figured out</i>
<i>who the real killer is.</i>

96
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:50,043
<i>Can you meet me</i>
<i>at Koiwa station tomorrow?</i>

97
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:53,413
[Sawada] I should have asked
for the guy's name.

98
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,820
Anyway, let's talk about
what happened back then.

99
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,723
‐About how Kayo Hinazuki died.
‐[Satoru gasps]

100
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,358
[Sawada] We know that on
the night of March the 2nd,

101
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,895
Kayo's mom and her boyfriend
beat her and locked her
in the shed.

102
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,231
That was around 10:00,
and she was still alive.

103
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,600
We know she froze to death,
and we also know

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,469
that when the mom
and the boyfriend found
her body the next morning,

105
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,606
they hid it 'cause they didn't
want to take the fall
for the murder.

106
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,542
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

107
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:25,779
The theory goes that Kayo
was taken from the shed
sometime after 10 p. m.

108
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,250
At about 12:30, Kayo's mom
went out to get her
and found her gone.

109
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,955
Then she called your house
and asked your mom if she knew
where Kayo was.

110
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,490
When they arrested
Jun Shiratori,

111
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,460
the only evidence they had
that tied him to the crime

112
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,262
was a pair of rubber boots
he owned.

113
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:46,199
The tread matched tracks
they found near the shed.

114
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,769
Here's how the police figured
the killing went down.

115
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:53,607
‐[clack!]
‐First he knocked her out
and took some pictures of her.

116
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,678
Next, he put her in
the walk‐in freezer at work
and sprayed her with water.

117
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:02,282
As soon as her temperature
dropped to 20Â°,
she was brain‐dead.

118
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:06,620
He waited around
for about 30 minutes
to make sure she was gone.

119
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,291
Then, just before dawn,
he put her body back
in the shed.

120
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,794
[door rattles, slams shut]

121
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,998
There's no way Yuuki killed her.

122
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,868
Kayo Hinazuki, Hiromi Sugita
and Aya Nakanishi...

123
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,804
Just before those three
went missing,

124
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:27,641
the same exact thing happened
in the next town over
from yours.

125
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:33,013
Someone was quickly arrested,
but he swore he was innocent,
same as Shiratori.

126
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:37,283
You see?
Same crime, same pattern.

127
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,252
It's beyond coincidental.

128
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,823
‐That means...
‐[Sawada] Exactly.

129
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,758
[Sawada] I've been trying
to tell people for years.

130
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,327
They called me crazy,
but in the end, I was right.

131
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,564
These crimes
were never really solved.

132
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,232
The killer framed every suspect.

133
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:56,570
So whoever murdered Kayo
also murdered Sachiko!

134
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,740
He's still on the loose.
In this city.

135
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,441
This bastard's beyond clever.

136
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,645
He plants a false trail
of evidence at the scene
of the crime

137
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,346
that leads the cops
away from him

138
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,582
and straight toward
some other poor sucker.

139
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:12,719
And while everyone
looks the other way,
he kills again.

140
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,700
[Airi thinking]
<i>This is too much.</i>

141
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,737
[man] You think he'll
try it again?

142
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,073
[man 2] If Fujinuma shows
his face here,

143
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,908
I'm gonna take his ass out
personally.

144
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,277
[man 3] So what's the story
with the high school girl?

145
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,945
[man 2] She was in it
with him.

146
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,181
[man 1] Yeah, but he didn't
want any loose threads,

147
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,316
so he tried to kill her too
to shut her up.

148
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,988
[man 2] Dragging her
into this shit.
What an asshole.

149
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,690
[Airi thinking] <i>They're wrong.</i>

150
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,526
[uncle] Please, Airi, you don't
have to apologize for anything.

151
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,729
[aunt] Your uncle's right.
We didn't know there was
a stalker after you.

152
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,231
You must have been
so terrified.

153
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,201
[Airi] But, Auntie,
that's not‐‐
‐You poor thing.

154
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,770
We shouldn't have left you
all alone in the house
like that.

155
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,908
‐[Airi] You're wrong.
‐The police know who it is
and they'll catch him soon.

156
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,943
You have nothing
to worry about now.

157
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,678
[Airi thinking]
<i>They're all wrong.</i>

158
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,626
<i>Everyone thinks Satoru</i>
<i>killed his mom</i>
<i>and tried to kill me.</i>

159
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,994
<i>But that's crazy.</i>

160
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,665
<i>It doesn't matter what I say,</i>
<i>no one believes me.</i>

161
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,671
[gasp]

162
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:41,241
[Sawada] You sure the message
was sent from Sachiko's phone?

163
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,277
Yeah. Before I could get
Airi out of the house,

164
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,513
she slipped her phone
in my pocket.

165
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,114
Check it out.

166
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,384
You weren't kidding.

167
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,720
Looks like he wanted
to help the cops catch you

168
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,522
by pinning the fire on you too.

169
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,324
But why go to all that trouble?

170
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,360
I'm already a suspect
in one murder.

171
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,096
Uh‐uh. This wasn't about
framing me.

172
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,498
He was after Airi
for another reason.

173
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,935
Do you think he tried
to kill her because
she had something on him?

174
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,971
To get me to take the fall
for my mom's murder,

175
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:14,808
he had to know when I'd be
home to find her.
That means he new my schedule.

176
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:19,479
So in the 24 hours between
when my mom saw him try
to kidnap that little girl

177
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,916
and when he killed my mom,
he must have gone
to the pizza place

178
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,051
and had a look
at the shift schedule.

179
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,221
If that's what happened,
I bet Airi saw his face.

180
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,924
He might even be someone
I've seen before.

181
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,861
It's possible. All we have to do
is find out who got behind
the counter that day

182
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,663
and we might have our killer.

183
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:40,801
Hell, it's worth a shot.
It might even break
this case wide open.

184
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,004
‐I'm off to the hospital.
‐Uh... OK.

185
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:48,008
[Sawada] There's a report
on the murders from 18 years ago
on my computer.

186
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,876
You should check it out.

187
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,047
[Sawada] <i>I have a theory</i>
<i>that Jun Shiratori</i>

188
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,817
<i>might suspect</i>
<i>his father to be the killer.</i>

189
00:11:56,817 --> 00:12:00,921
<i>Shiratori's refusal to talk</i>
<i>to authorities did not</i>
<i>help his case.</i>

190
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,589
<i>Perhaps he did not want</i>
<i>to say anything</i>

191
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,525
<i>that could possibly</i>
<i>incriminate his father.</i>

192
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,993
[Satoru thinking] <i>That figures.</i>
<i>Yuuki loved his dad.</i>

193
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,329
[Sawada] <i>Kayo Hinazuki's</i>
<i>classmates testified</i>

194
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,566
<i>they had seen her</i>
<i>and Shiratori together</i>
<i>many times.</i>

195
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:16,002
<i>The investigators focused</i>
<i>on their testimonies,</i>

196
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,038
<i>while ignoring</i>
<i>Satoru Fujinuma's.</i>

00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,773
[keys click, Satoru gasps]

198
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,175
[Satoru thinking] <i>Suspects.</i>
<i>I don't know any of them</i>

199
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,746
<i>besides Yuuki and his dad.</i>
<i>They only had five?</i>

200
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,349
[Sawada] <i>The investigators</i>
<i>thought Hiromi Sugita</i>
<i>was murdered</i>

201
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,885
<i>because the killer</i>
<i>mistook him for a girl.</i>

202
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:35,522
<i>Based on this assumption,</i>
<i>they made a list</i>
<i>of five suspects,</i>

203
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,058
<i>none of whom knew</i>
<i>Hiromi Sugita.</i>

205
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,329
Eww! That sucks ass.

206
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,799
I don't wanna hold
some ugly girl's hand.

207
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,034
But I'd be OK
holding Hiromi's.

208
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,003
Oh... that's gutsy.

209
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,606
[Satoru thinking]
<i>I think I know why Hiromi</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

210
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,641
<i>The killer knew he was a boy.</i>

211
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,578
<i>He only killed him</i>
<i>to cover his tracks,</i>

212
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,680
<i>to keep his name</i>

213
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,382
‐[computer keys click]
‐[Sawada] <i>Jun Shiratori</i>

‐[knock on door]
‐[nurse] Ms. Katagiri,
are you awake?

228
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:44,625
[Sawada] Excuse me,
I'm visiting someone, but...

229
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,561
‐Is the bathroom that way?
‐[nurse] Yes.

230
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,963
[Sawada thinking]
<i>Her name wouldn't be listed.</i>

231
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,533
<i>201 is vacant.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

232
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:55,135
‐She's sound asleep.
‐Thanks for the update.

233
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,038
[Sawada] Oh, one side!
I gotta pee like a mother.

234
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,240
[chuckles]

235
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,708
[sighs]

236
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,409
[Sawada] Ms. Katagiri.

237
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,378
Sorry to barge in
on you like this.

238
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,515
[woman] You wouldn't happen
to be be Satoru Fujinuma, hmm?

239
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:14,120
Huh? Uh, no.
Actually, I'm a friend
of Satoru's.

240
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,924
It's nice to meet you.

241
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,093
I'm Airi's mother.

242
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,968
[Airi] Satoru didn't do
what the police are saying.

243
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:31,872
I know he didn't kill his mom,
and he wasn't trying
to kill me either.

244
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,942
He didn't set that fire.
He was the one who saved me
from it.

245
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,478
You're confused,
after breathing all that smoke.

246
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,847
Your manager got you out
of the house in time.

247
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,617
I don't know
what they've told you,
but none of it's true.

248
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,920
They're even saying I helped him
kill his mom.

249
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,624
The worst part
about all this is...
no one believes me.

250
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:54,995
No one believes Satoru either,
and he's all alone now.

251
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,399
[mother] Airi, even after
all these years,

252
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,367
I still think about your father.

253
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,236
I should have gone after him.

254
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,575
I believe you, hon.

255
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,546
Hurry up now.
Go and find Satoru.

256
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,688
[phone vibrating]

257
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:25,425
[Satoru thinking] <i>Oh, crap.</i>
<i>I forgot to turn it off.</i>

258
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:34,067
[Airi] <i>You left it on!</i>
<i>Thank God.</i>

259
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,436
Airi, are you OK?

260
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,338
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>I'm good as new.</i>

261
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,542
<i>But I need to see you.</i>
<i>Can you meet me</i>
<i>under the you‐know‐what?</i>

262
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,545
Wait, no, don't go there.
I got you in enough trouble‐‐

263
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,748
<i>Don't worry, I'll make sure</i>
<i>no one follows me, promise.</i>

264
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:51,017
[phone hangs up, beeps]

265
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,788
‐[boy 1] And go!
‐[boy 2] Yeah, let's follow it!

266
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,190
[Satoru thinking] <i>Meeting her</i>
<i>isn't a good idea.</i>

267
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,894
<i>I could have asked</i>
<i>if she saw someone</i>
<i>peeking at the schedule.</i>

268
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:05,331
<i>The more she gets involved,</i>
<i>the worse it's gonna be</i>
<i>for her.</i>

269
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,669
[boy] That sucked.

270
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:12,639
‐It doesn't fly that far at all.
‐Yeah, how come?

271
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,441
The wings are straight.

272
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,312
[Satoru] If you do this,
it'll give it
more aerodynamic lift.

273
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,982
Are you sure that's
really gonna help it?

274
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,416
Try it out.

275
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,321
[boy] No way, it worked!

276
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,957
Look, it's heading
for the river!

277
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,526
[boys laughing]

278
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:34,661
[woman] What's a grown‐up doing
here at this time of day?

279
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,363
Is he out of work?
I hope he's not a pervert.

280
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:42,168
[Satoru thinking] <i>Poor Yuuki.</i>
<i>I bet he had to hear</i>
<i>the same thing back then.</i>

281
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,480
[sigh]

282
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,160
[Airi panting]

283
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:17,504
‐[Airi] See? I made it.
‐[Satoru] Yeah.

284
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:20,306
And I made sure no one followed,
like I promised.

285
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,676
[Satoru] Cool.
[thinking] <i>I feel terrible.</i>

286
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:26,279
For a sec there, I thought
this might be a trap
by the cops.

287
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,881
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

288
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,349
[Airi giggles]

289
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,884
You better be thinking
like that.

290
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,254
You're a fugitive so you can't
take any chances.

291
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:37,658
Anyway, I'm glad you trusted me
enough to meet me.

292
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:39,626
Yeah.

293
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,595
[Airi] At work...

294
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:44,430
I'd say Mr. Nishizono
is pretty sketchy.

295
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,300
‐Nishizono?
‐I've seen him once or twice.

296
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,536
He's on the city council
'cause he wears that pen.

297
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,805
The boss is always
kissing his butt, too.

298
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,974
When they meet, it's always been
in the boss's office,

299
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:57,010
so he could totally peek
at the schedule
and get my address.

300
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,812
Hah, I even said hi to him.

301
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,815
[Satoru thinking] <i>The list</i>
<i>didn't have a Nishizono on it.</i>

302
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,550
<i>Maybe it's a fake name.</i>

303
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,520
<i>No, he couldn't use a fake name</i>
<i>if he's on the city council.</i>

304
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,590
I think he came after me
'cause I saw his face before.

305
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,192
<i>That's not coming together.</i>
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

306
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,895
<i>There's still a piece missing.</i>

307
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:17,531
Satoru, I know how you must
be feeling,

308
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,866
but you can't beat
yourself up.

309
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:23,904
I try and try.
I can never make things right.

310
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,572
‐Hmm?
‐Oh, nothing.

311
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,708
It's an idea
for a manga I had.

312
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,476
The Grim Reaper makes
a scheduling error

313
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,478
and the kid dies
on the wrong day.

314
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,416
He tries to bring the kid
back to life, but it backfires.

315
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,585
Someone else dies,
so he tries again,

316
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,787
and someone else suffers.

317
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,856
He just wants to do
the right thing,

318
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,759
but everyone he meets ends up
one way or the other,

319
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,428
miserable or dead.

320
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:53,667
[Airi] So are you saying
you're kind of like
that Grim Reaper?

321
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,969
[Satoru] Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

322
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,171
You're an idiot.
Do I look dead?

323
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:02,342
And as for being miserable
or whatever, what does he know?
That's his opinion.

324
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,612
Your Grim Reaper character
should have a little more faith
in himself.

325
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:10,684
I think it's too soon
to give up on what you want
'cause nothing's set in stone.

326
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:12,686
However this ends
is still up in the air,

327
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,421
and no one knows
what it's gonna be yet.

328
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,990
[soft rain falling]

329
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,493
Airi, I'm really glad
I got to meet you.

330
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,964
[Satoru thinking]
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

331
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,732
[gasp]

332
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,834
Satoru Fujinuma.

333
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:34,074
‐Run, Satoru!
‐Out of the way!

334
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,809
Airi!

335
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:39,479
Satoru Fujinuma,
you're under arrest

336
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,949
for murder, attempted murder,
and arson.

337
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,724
[officer] 4:50 p. m.,
suspect apprehended.

338
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:56,663
[Airi] He didn't do it!
Let me go! He's innocent!
He didn't kill anyone! Satoru!

339
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:59,633
[Satoru thinking] <i>I knew</i>
<i>me and Airi wouldn't last.</i>

340
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:03,036
<i>Either I'd get caught</i>
<i>or Revival would</i>
<i>make it disappear.</i>

341
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,707
<i>Here it is, the last time</i>
<i>I'll ever see her.</i>

342
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,341
<i>I know what I should do.</i>

343
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:13,146
Satoru! I'm sorry!
I didn't tell 'em
you were here!

344
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:18,351
I swear I didn't tell 'em!
They followed me!
I'm sorry, Satoru!

345
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:21,287
[Satoru thinking]
<i>I have to leave her</i>
<i>with some kind of hope.</i>

346
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,257
<i>Just like she did for me.</i>

347
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:27,427
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

348
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,263
I'm sorry!
This is all my fault!

349
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:35,502
[Satoru thinking]
<i>What would a superhero say</i>
<i>at a time like this?</i>

350
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,242
Isn't it hard having to fight
bad guys by yourself?

351
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,982
[Satoru] It's not your fault.

352
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,885
I know I'll get
through this somehow,

353
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:54,454
'cause I know
you believe in me.

354
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:58,525
So thank you, Airi.
I'm glad I trusted you.

355
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,840
[water bubbling, sloshing]

356
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:34,294
[theme song plays]

357
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,732
[woman singing in Japanese]

It's all right, but...

6

[sighs] how do I put this?

7
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,241
Readers want to see
what makes an artist tick.

8
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,376
You gotta dig deep down
into yourself.

9
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,211
That's what art's all about.

00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,014

It's about time.
You were out for two days.

[Airi] Hiya, sleeping beauty.

60
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,581
So, do you know who you are
and how you got here?

61
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,017
Satoru Fujinuma, I'm 29.

62
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,054
I was chasing a truck and...
I got hit.

63
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:18,491
Awesome! The doc
said it's a miracle
you didn't get hurt more.

64
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,494
Do you want me to go call
someone for you?

65
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,297
Like a friend or girlfriend
or something?

66
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:28,001
[Satoru] Huh‐uh.
There isn't anyone I want
to bother telling.

67
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,438
[Airi] Snip‐snip.

68
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,541
I don't get it.
That supposed to be funny?

69
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,544
No, I'm just trying
to cut through that
thick cocoon you're in.

70
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:41,648
You come off like the type
who doesn't open up
or care about anyone.

71
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,416
The non‐laughing type.

72
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,519
But after the other day,
I know better.

73
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,689
‐How so?
‐You saved that kid's life.

74
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,492
I was right there and I saw
the whole thing go down.
And you know that truck driver?

75
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,896
Well, I heard he had
a heart attack and died
at the wheel.

76
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,064
I still don't get
how you noticed that.

77
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,432
Lucky, I guess.

78
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,367
Yeah, well, the truck crashed
into a warehouse

79
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,538
and amazingly
you and the driver
were the only casualties.

80
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,072
[Satoru]
<i>What about the damages?</i>

81
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,174
[Airi] I told our manager
what happened, and he says

82
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,644
insurance will take care of
the bike and the other car.

83
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,013
And then when you get better,
come back to work.

84
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,315
[sighs] That's good news.

85
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,017
Hah! I caught you smiling.

86
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,588
Hmm. How come you work
at the pizza place?

87
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,023
It can't be for the money.

88
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,226
Wow! Now, there's
a personal question.

89
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,894
Oh, sorry. Was it?

90
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,364
Mm‐hmm. In fact,
you're the first person
to ever ask me that.

91
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,934
I work there 'cause
I have a dream.

92
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:37,337
‐That's cool.
‐Don't you wanna know
what it is?

93
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,441
Well... aren't you worried
it would jinx it for you?

94
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,878
Besides, if it didn't come true,
people would think
you're a loser.

95
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,648
Oh, I'm not worried
about telling anyone.

96
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:51,484
The more I talk about it,
the better the chance
it'll come true.

97
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,119
That's what I think, anyway.

98
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:58,525
[Satoru thinking] <i>Wait,</i>
<i>where have I heard that before?</i>

99
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,728
You know what?
I've decided I'm not going
to tell you about it after all.

100
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:05,065
It's not like we're dating
or anything like that.

101
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:09,302
I'm going to let the nurse
know you're awake,
and then I'm going home.

102
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,137
See ya.

103
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,641
[Satoru sighs]
<i>Man, she's weird.</i>

104
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,380

105
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,450

[movie projector clicks on]

107
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,890
<i>When it happens,</i>
<i>I go back in time</i>

108
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,993
<i>anywhere from one</i>
<i>to five minutes.</i>

109
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:37,330
<i>Then it always happens</i>
<i>before something bad goes down.</i>

110
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,033
<i>It's like someone's forcing me</i>
<i>to fix whatever's gone wrong,</i>

111
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,904
<i>so I start looking for</i>
<i>the one thing that seems,</i>
<i>you know, off.</i>

112
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,406
<i>I've managed</i>
<i>to stop a lot of tragedies.</i>

113
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,341
<i>So far.</i>

114
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,244
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>I fix whatever bad's</i>
<i>supposed to happen</i>

115
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,113
<i>and everything comes out OK.</i>

116
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:57,518
<i>But sometimes, like this time,</i>
<i>things go bad for me.</i>

117
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,960
[food sizzling]

118
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,569
Oh. Hey there, Satoru.

119
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,704
Hey, Mom.

120
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,106
[mother] I went to the hospital,
but you were out cold.

121
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,744
Sorry I didn't stay, but I got
bored watching you sleep.

122
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,713
So, how is your head doing,
kiddo?

123
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,049
‐[Satoru] It's fine.
‐[mother] Yeah, right.

124
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,519
[mother] They told me you had
a head‐on with a car.

125
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,789
I'll be staying for a while.

126
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,191
Huh? What do you mean
you're staying?

127
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,728
What do you think I mean?
I want to make sure
my little guy's OK.

128
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,564
A car hit you,
for Christ's sakes.

129
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,532
You don't have to.
I said I'm fine.

130
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,668
Anyway, I only have one futon.

131
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,772
No worries. I can make do
with a sleeping bag
I found in the closet.

132
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,708
‐A hotel's better.
‐Nah, a hotel's too expensive.

133
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,578
Oh, then I can pay you back
for the hospital.

134
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,480
‐[mother] So keep it
and we'll call it my rent.

00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,352
<i>Same attitude too.</i>

137
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,990
Satoru, do I have to change
trains to get to Ueno?

138
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,993
No, you don't.
Wait, you wanna go sightseeing?

139
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,495
Well, I did come
all the way from Hokkaido.

140
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,532
Besides, if I had to look
at your face all day,
I'd get bored.

Come on, let's eat.

[mother] I took over
your futon and TV.

‐Sorry.
‐No, it's cool.

<i>If I need to use</i>
<i>the bathroom later,</i>

00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,385
<i>I'll have to tiptoe</i>
<i>around her.</i>

147
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,655
[mother] Hey, if you need
to use the bathroom later,

148
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,456
don't worry
about tiptoeing around me.

149
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,526
I'm gonna sleep
like a log tonight.

‐Hey, kiddo,
you remember back then?
‐Back when?

157
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,581
You were in fifth grade,
and something like this
happened in the neighborhood.

158
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,516
Do you remember that?

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,325
to try to get you kids
to forget about it.

163
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:25,098
You didn't know,
but your life was in danger.

<i>I was a shy kid,</i>

171
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,472
<i>but then I met</i>
<i>this local guy, Yuuki.</i>

172
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,308
<i>He'd play with me.</i>

173
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,812
<i>Yuuki wasn't his real name,</i>
<i>but I called him that.</i>

174
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:15,448
<i>He'd always say,</i>
<i>"Have courage."</i>

175
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,319
[Yuuki] I b‐bet I know
what the most popular k‐kid
in your class is like.

176
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,587
[Satoru] Huh?

177
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:24,324
For starters, I bet he's
cheerful and good at sports.

178
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,928
He ain't afraid to speak up
for himself and he can be
a goofball, too,

179
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,631
but not when it comes
to something he's super into.

180
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,132
Wow!

181
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,001
No biggie. Popular folks
are always like that.

182
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,838
You could be like that too
if you want to.

183
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,740
Just follow that kid's lead.

184
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,210
And don't be shy,
'cause if you have courage,
you can do anything.

[Satoru] Hey, Mom,
you notice anything weird?

208
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,284
‐Like what?
‐Look around.

209
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,787
Don't you feel like
something's off here?

210

I don't know
what you're talking about.

211
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,226
Wait, come to think of it,

212
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,029
you said the same thing
when you were a little kid, too.

213
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,633
‐[Satoru] Did I?
‐[mother] Yeah.
Remember the fire?

Hey, Fujinuma!
Over here!

[footsteps]

219
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:47,033
[Airi] She's your mom?
She looks so young,
I thought she was your sister.

220
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,935
[Satoru] Do you believe
in witches?

221
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,604
[Airi] I do now.

222
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,272
Is she mad at you or something?

223
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,809
‐[Satoru] No.
‐[gasp] Um, Airi?

224
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,178
Would you like to come over
and have some curry with us?

225
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:02,583
Yes, ma'am, I totally would.
Thank you for the invite.
I'll even help you make it.

226
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,751
[Satoru] Seriously?

227
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,988
[muffled conversation]

228
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,629
[Airi] No way. You draw manga?

229
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,397
Does that shock you?

230
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,431
Hmm‐mm, not at all.

231
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,801
If it's on Wikitanica,
it must be true.

232
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,068
You looked me up?

233
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,670
Of course. Why not?

234
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,938
[Satoru groans]

235
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,573
OK, guys, dig in.

236
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,576
[Satoru thinking] <i>Why?</i>
<i>'Cause I don't want you to.</i>

237
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,111
[Airi] This smells yummy.

238
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,381
‐Wow! It is yummy!
‐You did help.

239
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,152
You know, for someone so young,
you really know your way
around a curry.

240
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,154
So how long have you guys
been dating?

241
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,558
Oh, no, it's not like that.

242
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,527
[mumbling] He's more like
a friend.

243
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:49,963
[gulp] A friend I have
tons of respect for.

244
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,566
What? Too spicy for you?

245
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,435
No. It's great.

246
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,171
[Airi] It was super nice
meeting you.

247
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,875
I can give you a lift
to the station.

248
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,278
It's already so late.
You can spend the night
if you want.

249
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,548
No, she can't, Mom.
She's in high school.

250
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:12,118
Thanks for having me over,
and for the ride, Satoru.

251
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,656
No worries, just keep an eye out
for cops, OK?

252
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,057
Mm‐hmm.

253
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,298
Welcome home.

254
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,468
Let's get something
straight, Mom.

255
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,705
She's not a potential wife
for me, she's my coworker.

256
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,740
Oh, please, don't be so dense.

257
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,644
You heard her, she respects you.
You totally have a shot
with her.

258
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,379
God, she was just being polite!

259
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,848
Don't go blowing a compliment
out of proportion.

260
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:46,620
I'm not. She doesn't seem like
the type who'd say that
unless she meant it.

261
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,288
‐Huh?
‐Oh, by the way,

262
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,991
your landlady came over
asking about the rent.

263
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,392
Great.

264
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,328
[mother] Satoru,
about this afternoon...

265
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,931
‐What?
‐In the market's parking lot?

266
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,300
Yeah? What's up?
What about it?

267
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,069
I think you might have stopped
a kid from getting snatched.

268
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,638
You're kidding.

269
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,940
You're right, I am kidding.

270
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,688
[Satoru thinking] <i>I remember.</i>

271
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:25,325

<i>We weren't friends or anything.</i>

<i>But I'd always see her</i>
<i>alone at the park.</i>

276
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:46,012
<i>That night at the park</i>
<i>was the last time I saw Kayo.</i>

277
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,583
No, you don't get it,
I could have saved her!

278
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,987
If I'd have asked her
to walk home with me,
she'd still be alive!

279
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:59,192
<i>Back then, all I wanted was</i>
<i>to forget how guilty I felt.</i>

280

<i>I know my mom did</i>
<i>everything she could</i>
<i>to erase it from my memory.</i>

‐Curry!

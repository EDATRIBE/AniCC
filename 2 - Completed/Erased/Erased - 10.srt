00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:09,128
[teacher] Congratulations,
everyone.

<i>In 1988, the first time</i>
<i>I lived it,</i>

3
00:00:15,194 --> 00:00:17,861
<i>Kayo Hinazuki</i>
<i>and Aya Nakanishi disappeared</i>

4
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:20,128
<i>and their bodies</i>
<i>were found later.</i>

5
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:23,728
<i>I was too helpless</i>
<i>to save anyone.</i>

6
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:29,561
<i>I tried hard to forget,</i>
<i>and I did.</i>

7
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:35,528
<i>But in the end, I had</i>
<i>a big gaping hole in my heart.</i>

8
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:39,561
[teacher] These past six years,
we've experienced success
and failure,

9
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,394
happiness and sadness.

10
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:44,061
Good or bad,
the experiences we share

11
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:46,994
fill a void
we all have inside of us.

12
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:49,461
Everyone. Even me.

13
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:53,261
So keep filling it,
and you'll enrich your life,
and others' too.

14
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,728
That’s what life's about.
Never forget that.

15
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,961
[theme song plays]

16
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:16,961
[man singing in Japanese]

17
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:40,461
[Satoru] Uh, hey there.

18
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,328
[Aya] Who are you?

19
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,994
‐[Satoru] I'm Satoru Fujinuma.
‐[Kenya] I'm Kenya Kobayashi.

20
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:48,028
‐[Hiromi] I'm Hiromi Sugita.

21
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:49,794
[Aya] Have we met before?

22
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,494
[Satoru] Uh, you're
Aya Nakanishi.

23
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:53,161
I heard you're good at piano.

24
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:56,161
[Aya] Yeah, I guess.

25
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:58,961
So, did we meet
in piano class?

26
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,928
Well, actually, no.

27
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:03,194
So, anyway, what you reading?

28
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:06,161
[Aya] Oh, this? Shakespeare.

29
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,928
"King Lear." I've only read
"Romeo and Juliet."

30
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,494
[Aya] Reading this stuff
and playing piano
are my parents' idea.

31
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:16,061
[Kazu] I can't hear
what they're talking about.

32
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,461
Maybe we should try
and get a little closer.

33
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:21,294
Wait, now I remember where
I've seen you before.

34
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:24,561
You're the kids who are always
sneaking into that old building.

35
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:26,028
Aren't you?

36
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:29,761
Darn it. So much for having
a secret hideout.

37
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:32,328
Hideout? That's so childish.

38
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:36,594
‐[gasp] You...
‐You shouldn't call it childish.

39
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:39,294
Yeah, well, the only ones
who sneak around building forts

40
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:41,428
and secret hideouts
are little boys.

41
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:43,894
I bet you like playing
superhero too.

42
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:46,494
Don't make fun of superheroes!

43
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:51,528
‐[Hiromi] Easy, Satoru!
‐[Aya] Nice meeting you,
but I have to go now.

44
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:54,594
Bye, kids.

45
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:55,928
[Kazu] Hold up!

46
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:57,494
[boys] Kazu?!

47
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:03,494
‐What do you want?
‐A hideout...

48
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,161
is totally macho!

49
00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:08,494
Uh...

50
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:11,694
‐[laughs]
‐You should come
and see it sometime.

51
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:13,761
You'll get what I mean.

52
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:16,428
[Aya] You're a bunch
of weirdoes!

53
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:22,094
[Kenya] She’s childish.

54
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:26,028
[Osamu] You were so rad
yesterday!

55
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:28,328
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>It's my gloves,</i>

56
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:31,794
<i>right where I left them</i>
<i>18 years ago.</i>

57
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:34,961
‐Leveling up's
a pain in the nuts.
‐That's what makes games fun.

58
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:37,494
Hey, Satoru, Aya's gonna be
at the park soon,

59
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,561
so maybe we should
start heading over.

60
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,794
It's cool.
I can see the bench from here.

61
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:44,228
OK.

62
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:46,961
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Yesterday was a wash.</i>

63
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:50,394
<i>I gotta figure out</i>
<i>how to get close to her.</i>

64
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:51,861
[bam!]

65
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:57,394
All right, I'm here to see
this macho hideout of yours.

66
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:03,728
Um... thanks for coming, Aya.
Can you stay awhile?

67
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:06,428
Mm‐hmm.

68
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:09,194
‐[girl 1] See you.
‐[girl 2] Bye‐bye.

69
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:12,794
[humming]

70
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:14,461
You off to see Aya again?

71
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:17,761
[Kazu] Yep. We'll cruise by
the hideout later.

72
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,561
Well, guys, see you then!

73
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:23,394
‐Later days, teach!
‐"Goodbye" is more proper.

74
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:26,494
I can't picture Aya
and Kazu liking each other.

75
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,461
Yeah, me neither,
but the good thing is,

76
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,794
she's always got
someone with her now.

77
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:32,561
[Satoru] Mm‐hmm.

78
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:36,794
Um, you guys, I...
I just wanted to say thank you.

79
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:40,094
‐Why?
‐I think it's awesome
how you're going around

80
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:41,961
making sure
none of us are alone.

81
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:43,894
Both of my parents work,

82
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:48,094
and nothing felt worse
than me getting home
and the house being empty.

83
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:53,728
It's pretty awesome how you kept
Kayo and Aya and me from being
alone all the time.

84
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,494
So thank you.

85
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:57,594
[giggles]

86
00:05:57,594 --> 00:06:02,661
Hey, guys!
We going to the hideout or what?
I'm getting tired of waiting.

87
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:07,161
‐What's up? Where's Kazu?
‐[Kenya] He went to go meet Aya.

88
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:09,561
‐How come?
‐You're joking, right?

89
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:12,561
It's not like she doesn't know
where our hideout is.

90
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,528
Maybe you should talk to him.

91
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:17,194
[Osamu] Oh, whatever.
Let's get going, already!

92
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,594
[others] OK.

93
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:20,894
[girls]
Goodbye, Mr. Yashiro.

94
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:29,428
‐[Osamu] Slow pokes
‐[Satoru] What's the rush?

95
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:30,928
[Hiromi] Wait up, guys!

<i>Hiromi Sugita,</i>

99

<i>and Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

100

<i>They're all still alive,</i>

101
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:44,628
<i>so I guess that means</i>
<i>the killer gave up on them.</i>

102
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:47,728
<i>But now that the clues</i>
<i>from the bus are gone,</i>

103
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:49,461
<i>how am I gonna find him?</i>

104
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:51,861
There. Now he really
looks like a girl.

105
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,661
‐[laughter]
‐[Kazu] Whoa!

106
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:58,761
Now what? Are you done?
You know, playing detective.

107
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:02,494
Not yet.
I'm still on the case.

<i>In 2006, my mom told Sawada</i>

<i>she thought she knew</i>
<i>who the killer was.</i>

110
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:16,061
<i>It's possible it's someone</i>
<i>she knows now, in 1988.</i>

111
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,328
<i>Maybe like Mr. Yashiro</i>
<i>and his candy,</i>

112
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:20,194
<i>the killer needs,</i>
<i>a substitute, too,</i>

113
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:24,094
<i>someone to take the place</i>
<i>of the kids that got away.</i>

114
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:35,328
Move it.

115
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:42,694
Well, me and Kenya
are heading out now
to go watch the hockey game.

116
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:44,828
‐Is Hamada playing?
‐You know it.

117
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:48,094
Wish I could go.
When you see him,
tell him I said good luck.

118
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,828
‐Sure.
‐See ya later.

119
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:52,494
[Hiromi panting]

120
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:54,761
Here I am.

121
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:58,494
You notice how Misato's been
keeping to herself lately?

122
00:07:58,494 --> 00:07:59,894
[Satoru] No. Really?

123
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:02,328
[Hiromi] Yeah.
People have been avoiding her,

124
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:05,228
ever since that lunch money
thing happened.

125
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:09,594
Oh, man. I guess I could try
talking to her on Monday.

126
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,861
[Hiromi] Cool.

127
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:19,328
[Satoru] Thanks for breakfast!

128
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:28,528
Oh, yeah,
I might be a little late today.

129
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:31,328
[Sachiko] Not too late, I hope.
When you know what time,

130
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,294
how about you call
and let me know, OK?

131
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:36,661
Mm‐hmm, I will.
See ya later, Mom!

132
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:39,028
Have a good day today, Satoru.

133
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,728
‐[girl 1] Mr. Yashiro's
gonna take us.
‐[girl 2] Really?

134
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:47,528
‐You‐know‐who will have to
walk over there.
‐[giggling]

135

‐[girl] Too bad for her.
‐[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>What can I say to her?</i>

136
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:58,161
Crap! Missed her.

137
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:08,994
Satoru, I heard you're gonna try
helping Misato next.

138
00:09:08,994 --> 00:09:10,861
Mm‐hmm, but she just left.

139
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:13,261
I bet she's going
to Wakaba Gym.

140
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,228
‐Really?
‐Yeah, Hamada's playing,

141
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:19,194
so Mr. Yashiro invited her
to go cheer him on.

142
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:22,194
You know what, she went
to last week's game alone, too.

143
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,094
‐Thanks.
‐Want us to go with you?

144
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:28,961
Nah, I think I better
do this myself.
It's no biggie.

145
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:32,794
OK, but I want
a full report tomorrow.

146
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:34,461
Got it, Detective Satoru?

147
00:09:34,461 --> 00:09:35,794
Sure.

148
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:38,028
We'll be at the hideout
if you need backup.

149
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:40,128
‐Mm‐hmm. See you later!
‐[Kazu] Later, dude!

150
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:41,794
‐[Osamu] See you tomorrow!
‐[Satoru] You got it.

151
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:44,294
‐[Kenya] Bye!
‐[Hiromi] See ya!
‐[Satoru] Bye, you guys!

152
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:47,561
Saying bye's
a big deal with him.

153
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:51,428
I know, right? He acts like
he'll never see us again.

154
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,094
Whoa! It's even colder
in here than outside.

155
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:00,894
[girl] Ohhh! Hamada!

156
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:03,128
Show 'em who's boss out there.

157
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:05,361
I can't concentrate
with you uglies yellin'!

158
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:09,361
‐Ah, we can yell if we want.
‐Watch the attitude, Kouichi.

159
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:12,528
‐Otherwise, no dinner for you.
‐What? But they're bugging <i>me!</i>

<i>There she is.</i>

<i>And she's alone.</i>

164
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:27,961
‐All right, guys, warm up
and get your game face on.
‐[team] Yes, sir!

165
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,061
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Now the killer's lost</i>
<i>two more potential victims,</i>

166
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:33,094
<i>it makes sense</i>
<i>he'd go for her next.</i>

167
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,328
<i>She's a perfect target.</i>

168
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:43,961
<i>She's going to the bathroom.</i>

169
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:45,861
Game starts in five!

170
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:48,228
[player] You got it, coach!

171
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:51,061
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Why is she taking so long?</i>

172
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:57,294
[door opens]

173
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:58,694
[gulp]

174
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:02,494
I needed a candy break.
What's wrong?

175
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,294
The game's about to start.

176
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:05,928
Are you standing guard
for someone?

177
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:09,094
Huh? Oh, uh... no.

178
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:11,394
I just wanted to talk
to Misato.

179
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:14,128
Misato. Hmm...

180
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:17,994
Huh.

181
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:21,028
‐What, did she go outside?
‐Uh‐huh.

182
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:23,494
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Where did she take off to?</i>

183
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:31,394
<i>That's Yuuki's dad's truck.</i>

184
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:33,628
Mr. Yashiro,
I need to follow someone.

185
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:36,194
‐Will you drive?
‐[Yashiro] Hmm.

186
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:43,194
[Yashiro] That doesn't
even sound legal.

187
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:46,061
It's nothing bad.
We're just playing detective.

188
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:48,561
We pretend there's
a kidnapper at large.

189
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:51,594
Then we try to find girls
who seem like they're lonely

190
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:53,294
and make friends with them.

191
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:56,328
If anything, we could end up
stopping a real kidnapping.

192
00:11:56,328 --> 00:12:00,561
My God, it might be just
a game, but it's a good idea.

193
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:02,894
I'm glad you think so.

194
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:06,428
Satoru, better buckle up.

195
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:07,861
Oh.

196
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,561
[Satoru straining]

197
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:15,494
[Yashiro] Oh, yeah.
I have to get that fixed.

198
00:12:15,494 --> 00:12:17,028
There.

199
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:24,728
So, you've noticed Misato's been
keeping to herself lately.

200
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:27,994
[Satoru] Actually, Hiromi
told me a little while ago.

201
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:32,961
[Yashiro] Well, if you ask me,
it's great you're being
so proactive about it.

202
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,461
[Satoru] I don't know
about that.

203
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:37,194
I couldn't get up the nerve
to talk to her before,

204
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:41,228
and, well, I started thinking
she might make good bait.

205
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,028
Really? Bait.

206
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,894
So you're out to catch someone.

207
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:49,628
Now I know why you were working
so hard to be friendly
and outgoing.

208
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:51,228
You’re a man on a mission.

209
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,694
Mm‐hmm. Everybody has something
that's missing from their lives,

210
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:55,961
even me.

211
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:58,261
If I can fill that void...

212
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:02,261
[adult Satoru thinking] <i>Crap.</i>
<i>I just fed him his own line.</i>

213
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:06,294
[Yashiro] You and I
have a lot in common.

214
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:09,261
That happens to be
my philosophy in life.

215
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:11,461
When I teach
a sixth‐grade class,

216
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:14,261
I like to bring it up
in my graduation speech.

217
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,728
It sort of ties into
what you said,

218
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:18,494
about using Misato as bait?

219
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:22,361
I can tell you regret it,
but in my opinion,
you shouldn't.

220
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:26,928
There's no difference between
a good deed and a bad one.

221
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:31,428
They both have a similar goal,
to satisfy a need
within a person.

222
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:33,594
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Well, that's... extreme.</i>

223
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:37,494
[Yashiro] For example,
lately I've tried
all kinds of things

224
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:38,928
to get closer to someone.

225
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:42,161
Sometimes I'm direct,
other times I play coy.

226
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,994
At times,
I've even been deceitful.

227
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:47,861
And boy, it's been fun.

228
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,694
With who? A girlfriend?

229
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:53,694
[chuckles] I can see how you'd
make that connection.

230
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:58,428
Hmm. Either way, it's about
filling some kind of emptiness.

231
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:02,794
Um... want a lollipop?

232
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:10,061
Thank you for asking,
but I'm afraid you won't
find any there.

233
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:17,294
You see, this isn't my car.

234
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:35,294
Where is your car then?
In the shop?

235
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:37,594
[Yashiro] Whatever your happiest
moment is today,

236
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:40,961
another will eventually
come along to replace it.

237
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:44,194
And thanks to you,
mine just got replaced.

238
00:14:44,194 --> 00:14:46,828
Nothing compares to the feeling
a person gets

239
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:49,228
when they can finally
satisfy their need.

240
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:51,261
You spent
all this time searching,

241
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:53,628
and when you get it,
it's like heaven.

242
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,428
You know,
it's true what they say,

243
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,494
the more effort something takes,
the sweeter the reward is.

244
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:02,794
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Where the hell is he going</i>
<i>with this?</i>

245
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:04,228
<i>Laxatives?</i>

246
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:07,228
[Yashiro] Satoru. You lied
to me a few minutes ago.

247
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:10,228
You said you're just pretending
there's a kidnapper,

248
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:12,828
but the truth is,
you know there's one,

249
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,394
and you're trying
to catch him.

250
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:17,128
I've resisted the idea
for a while now

251
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:19,194
because I couldn't believe
it was possible.

252
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:23,528
Well, more like
I didn't want to believe...

253
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:28,328
the possibility that someone
was anticipating my every move.

254
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:40,061
If you're still worried
about Misato, don't be.

255
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:45,028
The only person in that truck
is Jun Shiratori's father.

256
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:52,261
I realized something was up
with you

257
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:55,294
the day I saw you
following Aya Nakanishi.

258
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:57,161
And I was planning
to kidnap her

259
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:59,994
the day I gave
you and your mom a ride.

260
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:02,528
Looking back,
it's kind of funny.

261
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,428
I mean, there you were
trying to snatch my prey

262
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:08,494
and I was the one
telling you how to do it.

263
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:10,028
[chuckles]

264
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:13,128
That was the second time
you ruined my plans,

265
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:16,794
and I started to suspect
it was more than a coincidence.

266
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:18,828
I knew Misato's friends
were shunning her,

267
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:20,994
so I asked her
to the hockey game.

268
00:16:20,994 --> 00:16:23,461
Then I told Hiromi about it.

269
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:27,261
If you showed up,
my suspicions were correct,

270
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:30,894
that you...
you were my enemy.

271
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:32,761
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>No way.</i>

272
00:16:32,761 --> 00:16:35,828
[Yashiro]
When the time was right,
I gave Misato a drink

273
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,594
laced with that laxative
you found.

274
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:40,961
And I bought dinner, to place
Shiratori at the scene.

275
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:44,294
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>No. No!</i>

276
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:48,394
[Yashiro] Yes, sir,
all the pieces fit together
as planned.

277
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:52,994
And in the end,
I'm not who you thought I was.

278
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:56,528
Oh, and about the car,
I borrowed this one earlier.

279
00:16:56,528 --> 00:17:00,128
I was looking for something
specific for today.

280
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:02,694
Generic model,
generic paint job.

281
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:06,361
A car that's so ubiquitous,
no one would even miss it.

282
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:10,028
You know, this is
the first time I've put
that theory into practice.

283
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:13,094
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>How could I be so stupid?!</i>

284
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:22,628
<i>It was so obvious.</i>

285
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:25,494
Thanks to you, Kayo's alive.

286
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:28,194
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>I just couldn't accept</i>
<i>the possibility.</i>

287
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:32,128
<i>Yashiro was on one of Sawada's</i>
<i>lists of suspects.</i>

288
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:34,594
<i>But my mom's name</i>
<i>was right there with his,</i>

289
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:38,928
<i>so I figured the list was</i>
<i>bullshit and blew it off.</i>

290
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:42,661
<i>I trusted him so much,</i>
<i>I couldn't even think</i>
<i>of him as a suspect,</i>

291
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,861
<i>let alone the killer.</i>

292
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:47,428
<i>But...</i>

293
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:51,561
<i>he is.</i>

294
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:55,028
<i>And now he's got me</i>
<i>right where he wants me.</i>

295
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:22,094
It started snowing.

296
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:28,428
[Satoru straining]

297
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:32,428
[Yashiro] Don't.
It's stuck for good.

298
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:33,694
[Satoru panting]

299
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,694
[Yashiro] The game's over.

300
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:37,761
For you and me.

301
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,094
[Satoru struggling]

302
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:52,528
You know,
I still can't believe it.

303
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:56,561
You anticipated all my plans
and destroyed them one by one.

304
00:18:56,561 --> 00:19:00,461
I'm stunned how easily
you caught me,
a little boy like you.

305
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:07,828
It's almost like you can see
the future or something.

306
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:13,061
I want to make sure you
understand why you have to die.

307
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:15,228
Yes, you ruined my plans,

308
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:18,861
but this has nothing to do
with revenge.

309
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:21,994
Believe me, I do respect you.

310
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,861
But if I can't satisfy
my needs the usual way,

311
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:27,661
I have to find an alternative.

312
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:30,494
You don't have to do this.
You said the game was over!

313
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:37,861
The children of this town are
safe thanks to you, Satoru.

314
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:40,628
So congratulations,
you got what you wanted.

315
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:43,928
And as for what I wanted,
I still get to kill someone

316
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:45,861
for my sake and on my terms.

317
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:50,028
Yashiro, I'm not gonna die
until I see you hang
for what you've done!

318
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:53,394
Yes, well,
keep telling yourself that.

319
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,528
Yashiro!
You son of a bitch!

320
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:01,994
I'll get you for this!

321
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:09,461
I wish I could stay, but I have
so much packing to do.

322
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:14,594
Yashiro!

323
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:17,994
I know your future!

324
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:22,761
[adult Satoru thinking] <i>Shit.</i>

325
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:26,461
<i>It's cold.</i>

326
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:29,028
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

327
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:41,761
<i>Going numb...</i>

328
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:44,328
[young Satoru] Shit...

329
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:55,794

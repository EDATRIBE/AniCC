00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,241
[Osamu] You know what I think
sucks about this group?

107
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,511
There's no one
to talk Dragon Quest with.

108
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,378
[Satoru] Huh? Uh...

109
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,782
I mean, Hiro's
a Final Fantasy fan
and Kazu only plays shooters.

110
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,752
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>That's Hiro and Kazu.</i>

Heck, Satoru doesn't even
have a Famicom.

113
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,390
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

114
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,861
Jeez, Osamu, if we all played
Dragon Quest,

115
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,229
then that's all we'd ever
talk about.

116
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,097
The cool thing
about our group is,

117
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,667
we all like different things
so it's never boring.

118
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,135
<i>That's Kenya.</i>

<i>he was the brainiest.</i>

120
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,440
Can I ask you something, Satoru?

121
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,008
It's kind of personal.

122
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,243
Sure. Go ahead.

123
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,478

‐No way. Really?
‐He totally was.

127
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,719
This morning
he just stood there staring.

128
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,522
‐He couldn't take
his eyes off her.
‐Dang it, Satoru.

129
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,892
If you're in love with her,
you should have come
to me for advice.

130
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,894
‐Romance is right up my alley.
‐But...

131
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,430
No "buts" about it.
I'll fix it so's you
can hook up with Kayo.

132
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,567
Could you keep your voice down?

133
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,834
[Kazu] Why?

134
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,304
Well, it's like...
I don't love her.

135
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,839
Just curious about her.

136
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,241
‐That's the same thing.
‐You're brave to admit it.

137
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:40,614
Don't you worry about a thing.
By the end of today, you'll be
talking with your dream girl.

138
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,251
‐You're an idiot.
<i>‐Damn, she's cold.</i>

139

‐That's how you say hello?
<i>‐That's how you say hello?</i>

140
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,423
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

141

142
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,762

Um... Kayo?

144
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,736
I was thinking,
since we walk home the same way,

145
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,071
maybe we could be friends?

146
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,406
Friends?

147
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,308
What is it you like about me?

00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,677
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Oh, she's a pain in the ass.</i>

149
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:14,280
[Kayo] You don't have to answer
that if you don't want to.

150
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,849
I think I know.

151
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,619
You're just like I am.
You're fake, too.

152
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:24,858
<i>Wait...</i>
<i>does she know about me?</i>

153
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,894
[Kayo] I saw you
running home yesterday.

154
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:32,332
You looked happy.
Do you love your mom that much?

155
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,835
Yeah.

156
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,604
That's good.

157
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,841
[Satoru] Wait, Kayo, hold up!

158
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:44,444
So how about it?
You wanna be friends?

159
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,880
[Kayo] Are you serious?

160
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,719
So, like, does that mean
you'd kill to protect me?

161
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:56,256
[young Satoru]
<i>No, you don't get it,</i>

<i>Something bad was happening</i>

165

[Kayo] I think I know.

166
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,717

You're fake, too.

00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,224
<i>I guess maybe I might have</i>
<i>been acting a little weird,</i>

170
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,694
<i>but that's pretty much</i>
<i>how I was back in those days.</i>

171
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,629
<i>I wanted friends,</i>

172
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,932
<i>so I tried acting like</i>
<i>the person I wanted to be.</i>

173
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,968
If you have courage,
you can do anything.

174
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:50,143
<i>It was the only way</i>
<i>I knew how to fit in</i>
<i>in my middle school world.</i>

175
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,178
[Osamu] We were gonna
send a search party in...

176
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:56,517
<i>I bet she saw through that,</i>
<i>but she said I was like her,</i>

177
00:11:56,517 --> 00:12:00,420
<i>so maybe she's hiding</i>
<i>her true self too.</i>

178
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,589
So, how'd you make out?

179
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,358
Yeah, man, you gonna tell us
how it went or what?

180
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,561
Did you guys walk home together,
did you hold hands?

181
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,897
Jeez, no. We just talked
for a little bit, that's all.

182
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,299
‐[Osamu] Just you two, alone?
‐Mm‐hmm.

183
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,602
Sweet! That means
she totally likes you.

184
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,304
Dude, seriously, she never
talks to anyone alone.

185
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,741
‐You want me to give her
another message? Do ya?
‐[Satoru sighs]

186
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,709
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Could they be more annoying?</i>

187
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,678
Take it easy, guys.

188
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:28,148
‐Pressuring him like this
isn't gonna help him.
‐[Kazu] You're right.

189
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,652
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>He's talking about</i>
<i>something else, but, yeah.</i>

190
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:37,558
Satoru, in sixth grade, we'll
all be in the same class again,
so there's no rush.

191
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:39,425
Right.

192
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,394
[woman over loudspeaker]
<i>Attention, students...</i>

193
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,598
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>When did Kayo disappear, again?</i>

194
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,099
<i>I'm running out of time!</i>

195
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,569
‐[Osamu] Hey, Satoru, come on.
‐[Satoru] Yeah, coming.

196
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:50,704
[Osamu] Brrr!

197
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,372
It's cold. By the way,

198
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,641
where are those kick‐ass
McGregor gloves you got?

199
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,578
<i>Oh yeah. I remember I had</i>
<i>a pair of those.</i>

200
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,780
[Satoru] I guess maybe
I left them somewhere.

201
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,949
[Osamu] Oh. Well, they're
probably at the hideout then.

202
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,286
Hey, guys, can we
go to the hideout today?

203
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,054
What are you talking about?

204
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,156
Remember? We said we wouldn't
go there if it snows,

205
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,758
'cause everyone would see
our tracks.

206
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,960
Oh, w‐we did?

207
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,530
Oh, right, yeah. [awkward laugh]

208
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,732
‐[Osamu] See you tomorrow.
‐[Kazu] Later, dudes.
‐[Kenya] Later.

209
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,934
‐[Hiromi] Bye.
‐[Satoru] See ya.

210
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,772
Kenya! Thanks for speaking up.

211
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:29,610
It's like, they were making
such a big deal out of it,
I was freaking out.

212
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,046
Yeah, I bet you were.
You don't have
to thank me, though.

213
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,916
By the way, about Kayo...

214
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,052
I think it's great you want
to get closer to her and all,

215
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,421
but I get the feeling
there's something else going on.

216
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:45,325
‐[Satoru gasps]
‐[Kenya] I don't mean
to be nosy or anything, but...

217
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,861
I'm here if you need
to talk to someone.

218
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,897
And not just me.
The other guys are, too.

219
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,299
[Satoru] Thanks. And yeah...

220
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,569
I know everyone's
just trying to help.

221
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:59,139
Kazu did get Kayo
to talk to me after all.

222
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,875
So, wanna talk about it?

223
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,577
‐About what?
‐About Kayo.

224
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,747
‐Oh, right.
‐Did you talk to her?

225
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,815
Yeah. Only for a bit.

226
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:12,052
‐She even opened up
a little by the end.
‐That's good.

227
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:15,622
[Kenya] I know you've got
a lot on your mind,
but I was wondering...

228
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,991
[car revving past]

229
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,661
‐You read the essays yet?
‐Huh?

230
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,529
No, I haven't.

231
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,565
There are a couple
of interesting ones.

232
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:25,899
You should check them out.

233
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,602
I better go.
See you tomorrow.

234
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,537
[Satoru] See ya.

235
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,777
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>I think Kenya was hinting</i>

236
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:41,414
<i>at Kayo's essay being</i>
<i>the interesting one in this.</i>

237
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:45,351
[Kayo] <i>"A Town Without Me,"</i>

<i>I want to go to an island,</i>

<i>On the island,</i>

249
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:24,658
<i>I'll think about what's going</i>

‐No doubt about it.

258
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,285
[mother] I'm home.

‐Thanks for dinner.
‐Hmm?

260
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:58,792
<i>Kenya probably thought</i>
<i>I was interested in her</i>
<i>'cause of the essay.</i>

261
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,495
<i>After reading it, now I'm</i>
<i>even more worried about her.</i>

262
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,065
‐Hey, Mom?
‐Yeah, what's up?

263
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,801
For my birthday,
can I invite some friends over?

264
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:11,772
Mm‐hmm, sure, but our place
is kind of small.

265
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,339
How many friends
are we talkin'?

266
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,975
Not too many, just five.

267
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:18,612
You know, this is the first time
you asked to have a party.

268
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:19,880
Should I get a big cake?

269
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,548
Yeah! Thanks, Mom.

<i>I'm gonna do what I didn't</i>
<i>the first time.</i>

273
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,860
<i>If I can make her</i>
<i>do something different now,</i>

274
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,197
<i>maybe it will be enough</i>
<i>to change her fate.</i>

[mother] Hey, you still awake?

277
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,208
You said five.
Did you get yourself
a girlfriend?

278
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,512
All right, good night, kiddo.

<i>I didn't show my mom</i>
<i>my essay back then</i>

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,803
[Kazu] Man, it's snowing again.
No hideout today.

288
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:20,641
Satoru! Kayo's leaving.
Don't you want to talk to her?

289
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:21,642
[Kenya] Osamu...

290
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,877
It's OK, Kenya.
It's no big deal.

291
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,446
And thanks, Osamu.
See ya!

292
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,014
‐See you.
‐Later, dude.

293
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:31,351
‐Whoa!
‐Can you believe
how brave he's gotten?

294
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,122
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>I didn't have to run.</i>

295
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,525
<i>I already knew</i>
<i>where I'd find Kayo.</i>

296
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,094
<i>I was pretty sure</i>
<i>her mom was hitting her,</i>

297

<i>she wouldn't be going home</i>
<i>right away.</i>

298
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:48,301
<i>She'd go hang out at the park</i>
<i>until it got darker out.</i>

299
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:51,037
<i>Before I just thought</i>
<i>she was weird.</i>

300
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,273
<i>Not anymore.</i>

301
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:02,348
[Satoru] Kayo!

302
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,151
[Kayo] Satoru. What do you think
you're doing out here?

303
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,420
[Satoru] I was gonna say
the same thing.

304
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,792
I meant what I said,
I wanna be friends.

305
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,360
I won't kill anyone,
that's too much.

306
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,229
[Kayo] No duh. That was a joke.

307
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,399
[adult Satoru sighs]
<i>I hate dealing with her type.</i>

308
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,802
[Kayo] I know what you're
doing, Satoru.

309
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:23,704
You're just pretending.

310
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:27,007
Pretending to smile
and being nice

311
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,742
and worrying about people.

312
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:31,477
But I don't think
it's bad or anything.

313
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,280
I can't tell what you're
really like.

314
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,851
That sounds funny
coming from me.

315
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,385
[sighs]

316
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,689
Everything you said's true.
I am pretending.

317
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:46,492
I want people to like me.
I wanna have friends.

318
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:52,098
So I asked myself,
what can a loser like me
do to have that?

319
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,134
And you know what?

320
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,036
I tried liking everyone
and it worked.

321
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:59,806
It was hard at first,
but after a while,
it got easier.

322
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:04,511
Yeah.

323
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:09,282
And, like, the more you do it,
the better the chance
it comes true.

324
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,786
The more I talk about it,
the better the chance
it will come true.

<i>You have to try new things</i>
<i>and keep inspiring yourself.</i>

328
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,132
<i>That's how you change.</i>

329
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,702
<i>Is that what Kayo's doing, too?</i>

330
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:31,437
<i>I can tell she's suffering now.</i>

331
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,140
<i>But unlike me,</i>
<i>she acts like she doesn't care.</i>

332
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,410
<i>Pretending like she can't</i>
<i>feel anything at all.</i>

333
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,212
<i>But she's only 10.</i>

334
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,115
<i>She's not strong enough</i>
<i>to change her situation</i>
<i>at home.</i>

335
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:45,952
[Satoru] Hey, Kayo,
I brought something for you.

336
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,688
[Kayo] What?

337
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:51,124
[Satoru] I'm having
a birthday party
and I want you to come.

338
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,560
Uh... are you sure it's OK?

339
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,729
I mean, won't there be
tons of people?

340
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,297
[Satoru] Oh, I don't know yet.

341
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,933
But I wanted to give you
the first invitation.

342
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,938
It's on March the 2nd.

343
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,473
You're gonna come, right?

344
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,477
Uh‐huh.

345
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,615
Hey, aren't your hands cold?

346
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,518
[Satoru] Huh? Oh, yeah.
They kind of are.

347
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:20,587
I had some new gloves,
but I think I lost them.

348
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,564
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Take it easy, dude. You're 29.</i>

349
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:33,499
<i>Why are you getting</i>
<i>all flustered?</i>

350
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,069
Satoru, are you OK?

351
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,939
Uh... uh‐huh.
I mean, my hand's way bigger
than yours, huh?

352
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:40,373
You're an idiot.

353
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,977
Even so...

354
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:47,748
you seem like you're OK.
It's easy talking to you.

355
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,683
<i>Well...</i>

356
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,618
‐It's 'cause I decided
‐It's 'cause I decided

357
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,319
‐to be honest with you.
‐to be honest with you.

358
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,022
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

359
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,860
Wait, Kayo!

360
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,495
So, um, see ya tomorrow?

361
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,899
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>She didn't have gloves</i>
<i>either, did she?</i>

362
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:13,139
<i>Eighteen years ago,</i>
<i>I saw Kayo here, alone.</i>

363
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,108
<i>And then she disappeared.</i>

364
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:19,580
<i>If I remember right,</i>
<i>they found her body</i>
<i>after the snow melted.</i>

365
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:22,415
[young Satoru] This time,

366
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:26,152
I won't leave her
standing here all alone.

367
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,789
This time...

368
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,058
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>I'm going to save her.</i>

369
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,060

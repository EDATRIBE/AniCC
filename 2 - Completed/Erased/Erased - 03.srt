So, um, see ya tomorrow?

<i>And then she disappeared.</i>

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,306

00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,648
<i>That's what I</i>

<i>Aya Nakanishi, Hiromi Sugita.</i>

17
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,157
<i>That's right, Hiromi.</i>

18
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,593
<i>Kayo was the only one</i>
<i>who was 10.</i>

19
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:03,163
<i>That means she was kidnapped</i>
<i>before her birthday.</i>

20
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,165
<i>That's it!</i>

21
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>The day I'm looking for</i>

‐Why can't the girls...?
‐I betcha Hamada's gonna get
the fastest time again.

29
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,213
Maybe.

You're the awesomest‐est!

[Kazu] He was so close,
but he still kicked butt.

What crawled up his butt?

72
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,034
He's probably just mad
'cause he almost lost.

73
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,569
It's cool.

Kayo, wait up!

Hamada was faster than
I thought.

80
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,798
Yeah.

81
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,968
So, uh, what day
is your birthday?

82
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,473
What's wrong?

83
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,846
Didn't you say you were
gonna be honest with me?

84
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,818
I know, but I thought Hamada
deserved to win more than me.

85

Oh.

86
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,655
Sorry.

[Kayo] It's fine.

88
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,827
After all, you and me
are fakes and liars.

Satoru, wanna walk home?

90
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,541

<i>Whoa, he's sharp.</i>

97
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,043
I wanted to know her birthday.
Sorry, sir.

98
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,344
No worries.

99
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:55,081
By the way, I've noticed
you two have gotten friendly.

100
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,817
I don't know about that.

101
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,785
Well, why didn't you
just ask her?

102
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,255
I told her when mine is,
but she wouldn't tell me hers.

103
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,226
Aha! I think I know why.
Here, see for yourself.

No way! Thanks a lot.

107
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,505
I have a feeling Kayo felt
awkward about telling you.

108
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,273
She's a very shy girl,
you know.

109
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,276
I wouldn't make
too big a deal out of it,
know what I mean?

110
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,511
Mm‐hmm, you're right.

113
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,252
that was a close race.

114
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:36,422
Keep on doing your best,
with Kayo too, OK?

115
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,391
OK.

‐Not even.

Y‐You just found the courage
you always had in you.

a girl named Kayo?

‐Little Kayo? Sure I know her.
<i>‐That was quick.</i>

139

[Yuuki] I see her hanging out
by herself in the park a lot.

140
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,250
I talked to her
a bunch of times.

141
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,653
Is she in your class
or something?

142

‐[Satoru] Yeah.
‐[Yuuki] Oh, no way.

[Satoru] It's kind of early
for dinner.

147
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,831
[Yuuki] Yeah, but we
get up early.

148

I start work at my dad's
bento shop at 4 a. m.

<i>'cause every time we hung out,</i>

153
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:41,047
<i>Now that I'm older, I think</i>
<i>I get why he stuttered.</i>

154

<i>He was just nervous</i>
<i>and trying to connect with me.</i>

155
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:48,121
<i>But to a kid, he came off as</i>
<i>really mature and kind of wise.</i>

156
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,857
[man] So, what kinds of stuff
did you two talk about?

157
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,827
Did he ever make you feel
nervous or did you feel
safe around him?

There's this neat article on

Did you see anything
that made you uneasy?

[Satoru] Oh, it's late.
I better go.

166
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,888
[Yuuki] OK.

167
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,159
That's weird.

168
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,495
Somehow you seem more mature.

169
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,131
You think so?

170
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,535

Get in the house.

00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:16,202
[Satoru] Wait! How did Kayo
get those bruises?

198
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:22,509
Go on and answer him, honey.

You wanna show up for class

Morning.

[Osamu] Man, it's cold.

214
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,768
[teacher] If you know
the circumference,

215
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:57,804
divide it by 2 times 3.14
to find the radius.

216
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:01,942
If you know the diameter,
just divide it by two
and that's the radius.

Now then, who...?

If you forgot it,
please bring it tomorrow.

229
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:39,713
[teacher] Yes, it is strange
how Kayo's always either tardy
or absent on Mondays.

230
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,648
Do you have any idea why?

231
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:45,552
Yeah, I do. It's 'cause
her mom beats her on Saturdays.

232
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,589
So, you've seen the bruises
on her too, huh?

233
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,658
[Satoru] Wait,
you knew about this?

234
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:52,993
I suspected.

235
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,728
[Satoru] Well, then why
didn't you say anything?

236
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,632
I was worried what would happen
if the students found out.

237
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,602
You see how the other kids
avoid her.

238
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,804
If they found out she was
being abused,

239
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:07,040
they'd tease her and make
her life even more miserable.

240
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,809
They wouldn't do that!

241
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,578
I know you wouldn't.
You're her friend.

242
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,947
That's why I'll tell you
everything I know.

243
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,783
‐But keep it between us, OK?
‐Mm‐hmm.

244
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:21,888
[teacher] I started to suspect
Kayo's mother was abusing her
around last May.

245
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:25,626
I tried going through
proper channels,
but it hasn't worked.

246
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,160
[Satoru] Why not?

247
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,330
[teacher] Her mom's been
cleverly avoiding
the investigators.

248
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,635
Child Protective Services went
to her house three times
to speak with her.

249
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,537
She must have known
they were coming

250
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:38,371
because her and Kayo
were never home,

251
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,273
so no official interview
has happened yet.

<i>I said that out loud.</i>

255
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,649
[teacher] Yes, well,
I've spoken with Kayo's mom
a number of times.

256
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,451
There's no doubt
she's abusing her daughter.

257
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,387
But I have to wait
for CPS to confirm it.

258
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,591
When they do,
they'll take Kayo away from her.

259
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,926
<i>He's already got this</i>
<i>figured out.</i>

260
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,296
The thing is, once they
intervene and get her to safety,

261
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,366
it means she won't be
coming back here, ever.

262
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,670
I don't care about that
as long as Kayo's safe.

263
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,772
The sooner, the better.

<i>to do something now.</i>

267
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,516
I <i>have to do something.</i>

00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,153

269
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,789

271
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:36,763
<i>Oh, you'd think a 29‐year‐old</i>

<i>not to leave cash in his desk.</i>

272
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:40,366
‐[young Satoru] Mr. Yashiro?
‐What's up?

273
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,837
It's about the lunch money.
I can't find it.

274
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,507
[various students] What? Huh?
No! Figures.

275
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,875
Sir, I think I know
what happened.

276
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,211
Someone must have stolen it.

277
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,580
And I have a feeling
that someone is Kayo.

278
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,916
What?
How do you know she did?

279
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,518
Who else could it be?

280
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,953
I mean, she doesn't have to pay
for her lunches like we do.

281
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:03,356
It sort of figures the thief
would be someone who's poor.

282
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,726
‐[boy 1] Good point!
‐[boy 2] Did you take it, Kayo?

[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>The brat!</i>

284
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:12,566
The best way to find out
who stole it is to check
everyone's bags.

285
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,735
[girl] She's right, teach.
We should check 'em.

286
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:16,436
[boy] I just wanna
eat my lunch.

287
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,172
This sucks.
You gonna check your bag?

288
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,242
No. What's the point?
I already know I didn't
take the cash.

289
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,611
Check the bag of the person
next to you, too.

290
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,980
‐You stole it, didn't you?
‐Drop dead.

‐I know, right?
‐Poor kid, schmoor kid!

293
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,989
Found it.

‐[class screaming]
‐It was Kayo!
‐The poor girl did it.

295
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,928
I told you she took it.
Kayo's a thief
and should be expelled.

296
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,798
Shut up! It doesn't matter
if she's poor or hungry!

297
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,101
Kayo would never steal
anything from anyone!

[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>I bet</i> you <i>took the money.</i>

299
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,344
You know, anyone
could have taken the cash
from Satoru's desk

300
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,647
and planted in Kayo's bag.

301

[girl whimpering]

302
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,353
All right, guys. Remember,
Kayo was helping collect
the money earlier,

303
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,922
so of course she'd have it.

304
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,626
Misato, Satoru, it's over.
OK, everyone, back to lunch.

305

do it.

Thanks for speaking up
for me before.

310
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:30,210
Oh, sure.
She had no right accusing you.

311
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,045
Back in third grade,

312
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:34,615
Misato made fun of my pencils,

313
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,550
so I took her favorite
mechanical pencil

314
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,218
and chucked it out the window.

315
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,020
[Misato screams]

316
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,489
[Kayo] Since then,
she's hated me like
you wouldn't believe,

317
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,726
and I hated her right back.

318
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:49,495
This other time, she invited me
to a Christmas party
at her house,

319
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,833
but that was only to show off
how big her tree was.

320
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,503
It was really pretty, though.

321
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,707

00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,312
One what?

324
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,114
A Christmas tree.

‐Here.
‐Hmm?

You're gonna need 'em.

328
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,730
It gets super cold
up on the mountain.

329
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,767
I didn't say I was
going to go with you.

330
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,777
I always used to come here
to go skiing and bobsledding.

[Kayo gasping]

332
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:41,848
I'd even see a red fox or two.

There they are!

334
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,795
Aren't they cool?

335
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:58,599
<i>I remembered the foxes</i>
<i>running around and around.</i>

336
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:02,102
<i>But 18 years ago,</i>
<i>I was by myself,</i>

337
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:04,505
<i>and no one believed me</i>
<i>when I told them.</i>

338
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,849
Were they a couple?

339
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,751
Mm‐hmm. I bet they were.

340
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,687
[both gasp]

341
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,529
<i>The sky's clearing up.</i>

342
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,764
<i>It's a perfect night.</i>

343
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,769
There it is.

344
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:54,821
That's a Christmas tree!

345
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,256
Huh?

346
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,560
Don't be dumb, it's February.

347
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,364
[Satoru] We should come back
in summer and see it.

348
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,800
Our Christmas tree.

349
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,040
[Kayo] You're an idiot.

350
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:28,421
[dramatic soundtrack plays]

351
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,628
[theme song plays]

352
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,765

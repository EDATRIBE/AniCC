1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,442
I get what you're saying,
but before you came along,

2
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,477
I thought I'd always
be alone in life.

3
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:13,914
And here I am
with my very own family.

4
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,949
You made that possible.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,652
So thank you.

6
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,688
[young Satoru]
<i>She said "thank you."</i>

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,758
<i>but I can't remember</i>
<i>what for.</i>

8
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,460
[baby crying]

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,730
Uh‐oh, someone’s hungry.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,666
OK, OK.

11
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,478
[young Satoru]
<i>I remember now!</i>

12
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,948
<i>I saved Kayo's life.</i>

13
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:52,519
<i>After that, I made sure</i>
<i>Misato and Aya</i>
<i>were never alone,</i>

14
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,855
<i>to keep them safe</i>
<i>from the kidnapper.</i>

15
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,723
<i>And then...</i>

16
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,599
[Satoru] Yashiro...

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,571
I remember everything,
you son of a bitch!

18
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,247
[theme song plays]

19
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,127
[man singing in Japanese]

20
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,808
[Satoru] No way.
Kazu's a carpenter?

21
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,077
He and Osamu look like
they're doing great.

22
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,712
[Hiromi] Mm‐hmm.

23
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,815
By the way, Misato said she was
going to come by and see you.

24
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,249
What? Really?

25
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:07,020
I thought she hated my guts
after what happened in class.

26
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,589
Yeah, I remember that.

27
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,391
The lunch money thing she pulled
was so messed up.

28
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,695
It was, but don't forget
who started raising funds

29
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,530
to help pay
Satoru's medical bills.

30
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,932
She did that, too.

31
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,400
I had no idea.

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,335
[Kenya] Tell us about
the day you tailed her.

33
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,905
You know,
when you saw the killer.

34
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,574
Knew it.
You do remember everything.

35
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,781
But then
why didn't you tell us?

36
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,383
I didn't want
to get you involved.

37
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,886
It's been 15 years.

38
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,823
Whatever evidence there was
is gone by now.

39
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,491
And besides,
who'd believe me?

40
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,131
Like you said,
it's been 15 years.

41
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,667
Now that you're back,
I couldn't be happier,

42
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,836
because it's a miracle
you woke up at all.

43
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,438
That's why I didn't
bring it up before,

44
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,841
to spare you from the shock.

45
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,044
The last thing you need is
someone digging up the past

46
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,445
when you're trying to recover.

47
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,848
But you remember everything.

48
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:11,251
So, if you want to catch
the killer,

49
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,453
you don't have to do it alone.

50
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,690
Let us help you.

51
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,693
Hiromi's been coming here
to visit you all these years,

52
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,962
and now
he wants to be a doctor.

53
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,564
I became a lawyer,

54
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,667
and now I'm working with
Mr. Sawada to catch the killer.

55
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:30,504
Hiromi and I are who we are
because of you, Satoru.

56
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,238
You were a hero
to us back then.

57
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:36,076
and we want to help you again,
just like old times.

58
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,712
Just like we helped with Kayo.

59
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:42,683
You trusted me enough back then,
believed in me, you remember?

60
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,451
That's why I believed in you.

61
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:50,691
If someone believes in you,
you're not alone.

62
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,458
And if I was in
your situation,

63
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,561
I'd want someone
to believe me.

64
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,630
[Satoru thinking] <i>Airi.</i>

65
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,635
<i>I'm not alone.</i>

66
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,905
<i>I have friends</i>
<i>I can count on.</i>

67
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,811
The killer is...

68
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,345
Yashiro.

69
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,180
[Yashiro] I knew you remembered.

70
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,082
On the way up here,

71
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,986
I tapped my finger on
your wheelchair a couple times.

72
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,323
I could tell you tried hard
not to react.

73
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,727
Fifteen years ago,

74
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:30,997
you figured out what I was doing
and ruined my plans.

75
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,708
But how?

76
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:46,412
A child isn't capable
of such tings.

77
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:52,753
It's as if you were
psychic or something.

78
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:57,891
[young Satoru] Yashiro!
I know your future!

79
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:04,397
Let's have it.
How did you know
what I was thinking?

80
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,467
What did you mean,
you know my future?

81
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,636
What difference does it make?

82
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,673
Soon as I tell you,
you'll kill me.

83
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,975
[Yashiro] Oh, I know
what you're up to.

84
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:18,679
You’ve got a phone
in your pocket.
Are you recording us?

85
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,481
Or is someone listening in?

86
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,617
Kenya, perhaps?

87
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,501
You have heard of
the statute of limitations?

88
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:45,305
Even if I confessed, I can't be
tried for things I did
15 years ago.

89
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,709
And I haven't done
anything wrong since then.

90
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,612
So you see,
no matter what you do,

91
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,647
you can never get me, Satoru.

92
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:57,718
Oh, look, Kumi just
sent you an email.

93
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,823
At 4:30, she'll get
her daily IV.

94
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,091
I put a muscle relaxant
in her dose

95
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,962
and made sure your fingerprints
were all over the bag.

96
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:12,566
That poor little girl who was
afraid of her operation

97
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,768
will die peacefully now
thanks to you.

98
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:19,806
And feeling guilty,
I throw myself off the roof,
isn't that right?

99
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,280
There you go
reading my mind again.

100
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,517
While that might be
an amazing skill,
it won't save your life.

101
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,253
But you might save Kumi's if
you tell me what I want to know.

102
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:37,558
If I do, then what?
How do I know you won't
kill her anyway?

103
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,893
I can't guarantee I won't,
naturally.

104
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,262
But there is a possibility.

105
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,932
If you don't talk,
there won't even be that.

106
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,638
I hate to say it.
We're out of time now.

107
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,307
There was a 50‐50 chance
you'd tell me

108
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,610
how you knew about me back then.

109
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,713
Oh, well, I guess
it doesn't matter anymore.

110
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,948
I'm sure it was just
a coincidence

111
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,551
when you screamed
you knew my future.

112
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,252
That was just a bluff.

113
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,891
As for your mother...

114
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:16,329
we should send her an email,
let her know how sorry you are.

115
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,733
[Sachiko] Hey, kiddo,
I have to work
the morning shift tomorrow,

116
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,568
so I'll see you
in the afternoon?

117
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,205
I'll let him sleep.

118
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,909
[Satoru, weakly] Mom?

119
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,479
I lied to you.
I got my‐‐

120
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,048
Your memory back?

121
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,184
I know.
It happened when Kayo came by.

122
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,886
[Satoru thinking]
<i>Yep, she's a witch.</i>

123
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,488
You're right, but how come
you didn't tell <i>her</i>

124
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,224
not to bring up the past?

125
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,059
[Sachiko sighs]

126
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,262
[Sachiko] After Kenya
and Hiromi stopped by,

127
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,964
I felt I made a mistake

128
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,534
telling them not to bring
any of it up.

129
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,536
They couldn't say
what they wanted,

130
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,070
and that wasn't fair.

131
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,139
When Kayo showed up
with her baby,

132
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,875
I didn't have the heart
to ask her to do the same.

133
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:07,447
After waiting all this time
for you to wake up,
who am I to stop her?

134
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:12,753
I got to see your face
and talk to you every day
for the last 15 years.

135
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:16,156
Then when I heard you speak,
your voice all crackly,

136
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:20,193
it finally hit me,
you weren't a kid anymore.

137
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,128
I was happy...

138
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,330
My boy grew up.

139
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,940
Mom, I'm gonna
take life head‐on.

140
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,710
What in the heck
are you talking about?

141
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,612
Even when you were a little kid,

142
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,515
you always took it head‐on,
remember?

143
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,016
Mm‐hmm.

144
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,393
[Satoru] Life is about
filling up the void in yourself.

145
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,061
[Yashiro] Indeed.

146
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,164
Whenever I taught sixth grade,
I always told the class that.

147
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,734
I remember what your face
looked like.

148
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,236
The day they took Kayo
from her mom.

149
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,739
The expression you had
stuck with me

150
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,941
even after all these years.

151
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:12,879
A little while after I was born,
my dad took off.

152
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,415
So I have no idea
what he looks like.

153
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:21,187
But that day at Kayo's,
you were the dad I never had
and I always wanted.

154
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:25,992
At that moment,
you filled the void in me.

155
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:35,802
[Yashiro] For the last 15 years,
I've been waiting for you
to wake up.

156
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:40,741
When you slipped into your coma,
I lost the impulse
that defined me,

157
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,610
the thing
that gave my life meaning.

158
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,013
I've waited a long time.
But now...

159
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,982
You're not alone anymore?

160
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,786
So, how are we
gonna settle this?

161
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:56,557
Are you gonna turn yourself in
or kill me?

162
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:58,391
Which is it?

163
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,727
It's already settled, actually.

164
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,029
You're right, I beat you.

165
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,733
I saved all of them from you.

166
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:10,470
Kayo, Aya, Hiromi, Yuuki.

167
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,607
Even my mom,
who you haven't killed yet.

168
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:16,176
Your mom?
Why would I kill...

169
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,679
Hold on, are you saying
you can‐‐

170
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,782
[Satoru] I'm just telling you

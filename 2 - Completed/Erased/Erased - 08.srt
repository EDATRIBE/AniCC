You're up.

00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,774
Good morning.

13
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,442
[Satoru] Why did you get up
so early?

14
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,978
[Sachiko] Isn't it obvious?

15
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,613
I'm making breakfast.

16
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:03,049
You are heading off to school
early again, aren't you?

17
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,284
[Satoru] Yeah.

18
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,820
It looks good.

19
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,293
Slow down, kiddo.
You'll make yourself sick.

20
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,862
Can I ask you something, Satoru?

21
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,263
Mm‐hmm.

22
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,133
[Sachiko] Who are you meeting
this early in the morning?

23
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,736
Can't tell.

24
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:26,306
[Sachiko] You're not doing
anything bad, are you?

25
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,843
[gulp] Course not.

26
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,978
OK, then.

27
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,082
‐See you later, Mom.
‐[Sachiko] Hold it.

28
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,485
Take this, too.
It's a little something extra.

29
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,222
You know, if you get
hungry before lunch.

30
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,489
Right.

31
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,726
Thanks a bunch, Mom.

32
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,376
It's me. Morning.

33
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,347
[weakly] Good morning, Satoru.

34
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,282
[Satoru] I brought you
some breakfast.

35
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,317
Thanks, but did you
eat anything yet?

36
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,720
[Satoru] Yep. This is all yours.

37
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,124
Wow! It looks yummy.

38
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,926
How are you doing?

39
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,396
You must be bored.
Too bad this place
doesn't have a TV.

40
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,800
It's OK.
I'm not as bored as you think.

41
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,869
Hiromi brought a ton
of books yesterday.

42
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:32,305
That's good. Think you can hold
out for another couple days?

43
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,274
[Kayo] Mm‐hmm.

44
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,812
That was so good.

45
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,383
‐See ya later.
‐Mm‐hmm.

This grad ceremony's
gonna suck.

51
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,915
I have to give the speech.

52
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,216
Please, you'll be great.

53
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:19,252
Oh, you're better at giving
speeches than me, Aya.

54
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,388
[Aya] Not even, Saki.
It'll be fine, you'll see.

55
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,460
Just have a little courage.

56
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,431
[bell chimes]

57
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,167
I guess Kayo's absent... again.

58
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,470
You're her friend.
Do you know what's up with her?

59
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,773
No. No one was home
when I went by there.

60
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:43,109
Where is she?
I mean, if she was sick,
we would have heard.

61
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,680
Yeah, but there's been no word
yet, from her mom, anyway.

62
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,050
[girl] I'm starting to get
a bad feeling, real bad.

[students murmuring]

64
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:57,223
Come on, I'm sure she'll
show up sooner or later
like she always does.

65
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:01,227
‐So how about we get started?
‐[students groan]

66
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,597
[teacher] Really?

67
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,132
No one was there
this morning either, huh?

68
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,467
Are you worried?

69
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,869
[Satoru] Mm‐hmm.

70
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,304
You don't look like
you're all that worried.

71
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,206
I'm just trying to stay calm.

72
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:18,111
‐Like you always say,
panicking never helps anyone.
‐You're right.

73
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,348
I tried calling Kayo's
yesterday and today,
but there's no answer.

74
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,318
Also, I tried calling the place
where her mother works.

75
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,287
They told me
she hasn't been in.

76
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:30,991
Well, then call the CPS people
or the police!

77
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,094
The police, huh?
I don't know.

78
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:38,398
I'd hate to open a can of worms,
for someone else, that is.

79
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,405
I called CPS yesterday, though.
They'll visit her house today.

80
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,373
And I'm going to meet them.

81
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:51,344
I'm pretty sure if we
all show up there, we'll get
to the bottom of things.

82
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:55,148
It's like I always say
in class: where there's
a will, there's a way.

83
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,984
You're the best!

with Child Protective Services.

88
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,935
Is she even home?

89
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,505
Well, all the lights are on,
so someone has to be.

90
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,141
Why don't we have a look
around the back?

91
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,709
[knocks on window]

92
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,478
[man] Ms. Hinazuki
are you home?

93
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,113
[knocking] Kayo?

94
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,854
‐I'm coming in.
‐[woman] You can't just
walk in!

95
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:37,290
Don't worry.
If anyone complains,
I'll take the blame.

96
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,828
The girl's been missing
for three days now.
It's worth a shot.

97
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,340
[Gaku] A stove
and the lights are on.

98
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,511
There’s a half‐eaten dinner
on the coffee table.

99
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,881
I don't see Kayo's coat
anywhere.

100
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:04,084
By the looks of it, her mom
was just here a minute ago.

101
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,552
She left in a hurry.

102
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,087
I bet she saw us pull up.

103
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,090
By the time we got to the door,
she was out the back.

104
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,393
Damn it, I was hoping
we could take custody
of the girl tonight.

105
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,697
[Gaku] Look,
her mother can't stay out
in this cold all night.

106
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,099
As soon as we leave,
I'm sure she'll come back.

107
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,967
We can try again
tomorrow morning.

108
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,469
I'm worried
about Kayo's safety, though.

109
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,607
We could get the police to put
an APB out on the mom.

110
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:30,043
Huh‐uh.
I have a feeling Kayo's safe.

111
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,478
In fact,
I'm positive she is.

112
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,480
OK, we'll take your word
for it.

113
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,418
We'll leave for now,
give the mother a chance
to calm down.

114
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:43,289
[Satoru] Mr. Yashiro
and Child Protective Services
were just at your house.

115
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,727
They were looking for your mom,
but she wasn't there.

116
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,730
By tomorrow,
all of this might be over.

117
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,133
Kayo, they said they'd take you
away from her.

118
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,503
That's OK.
I'd be way happier without her.

119
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,840

<i>away from her mom,</i>

<i>they'd be taking her</i>
<i>away from us, too.</i>

121
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,879
[Kayo] It'll be hard to go,
but I'll be fine.

122
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,981
Whenever I think of you guys,

123
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:11,184
I'll remember
all the fun we had.

124
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:14,855
Satoru, I know it's
a little late, but...

125
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:18,024
I finished
your birthday present.

126
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,926
Here you go.

127
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:26,099
<i>I'll give you your present</i>
<i>tomorrow, promise.</i>

128
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,146
Thank you.

<i>I don't know.</i>

131
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,787
<i>Like I've been waiting</i>
<i>for this forever.</i>

132
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,593
It doesn't take much
to make you tear up, huh?

133
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,961
Wh‐What?

134
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,765
Oh, hey, Satoru?
Can you spend the night?

135
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,167
[Hiromi] That’s totally gutsy!

[Kayo] Dorks.

137
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,572
Last night someone came in
while I was sleeping.

138
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,173
He just walked in.

139
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,610
I don't think he knew
I was here.

140
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,045
But it scared me.

141
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,649
[Kenya] Maybe it was
a security guard or a janitor.

142
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,217
It could have been anyone.

143
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:21,421
Some pervy kid
stashing his porn, who knows?

144
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,123
It was a grown‐up.

145
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:27,360
Whoever it was was mad.
He kicked that box super hard.

146
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,095
Let's open it.

147
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,866
I hope it's nothing worse
than porn.

148
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:36,837
[contents pounding floor,
Satoru gasps]

149
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,080
[Hiromi] What's that for?

150
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,617
[adult Satoru narrating]
<i>I knew.</i>

151
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:54,087

152
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:59,225
<i>Then it hit me.</i>

<i>next victim, went.</i>

154
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:10,704
<i>We hadn't escaped the loop</i>
<i>of kidnappings and murders yet.</i>

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,748
<i>March the 2nd.</i>

156
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,349
<i>Sometime after 10 that night,</i>

157
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,120
<i>Kayo disappeared from</i>
<i>the shed behind her house.</i>

158
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,957
<i>Tracks found</i>

<i>from a pair of rubber boots.</i>

159

<i>They matched a pair</i>
<i>Yuuki owned.</i>

160
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:38,264
<i>The killer put Kayo</i>
<i>in a walk‐in freezer</i>
<i>and sprayed water on her,</i>

<i>to make her freeze</i>
<i>to death faster.</i>

162

No. No, it's not.

00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,427
Our plan was to have
someone find Kayo here,

169
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:11,497
but now, after seeing this crap,
we'd better move her.

170
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:15,168
Mm‐hmm. We don't want
some creep to find her.

171
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,539
Well, I hope you have
a plan B.

172
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,741
I do.

173
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,910
Awesome. OK. Let's clear out.

174
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,854
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Remember what that</i>
<i>footprint looks like.</i>

175
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,756
<i>Huh?</i>

176
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,391
<i>What's all that black stuff?</i>

177
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:43,029
[gasp] <i>Charcoal and a stove.</i>

178
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,465
<i>Was the killer</i>
<i>gonna use this to...</i>

179
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,608
No! No!

180
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,979
[Kenya] Satoru. Flipping out
isn't going to help.

181
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,648
Yeah, you're right.

182
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,150
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>I gotta keep a clear head.</i>

183
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,154
All right, let's get going.

184
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,156
It was such a cool hideout.

185
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,759
Right, but not if
some weirdo's using it, too.

186
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,127
[Satoru] Yeah.

187
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,029
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>However we do it,</i>

188
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,933
<i>we need to make damn sure</i>
<i>Kayo stays out</i>
<i>of the killer's range.</i>

189
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:23,570
<i>But now, with</i>
<i>Child Protective Services</i>
<i>on the case,</i>

190
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,438
<i>the future has to change.</i>

191
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,209
<i>It's got to.</i>

192
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,780
Wait, this is plan B?

193
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,149
[Satoru] Mm‐hmm. Simple, huh?

194
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,851
There's just one last hurdle.

195
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,486
It would have saved us a lot
of hassle if you'd thought of...

196
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,755
[Satoru] I'm home.

197
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:45,892
[Sachiko] It's about time.

198
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,230
Um, uh... hello.

199
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,464
Hello.

200
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,467
All right, what's going on?

201
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,543
I'm helping a friend
in trouble, that's what.

202
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:15,221
Way to go, guys. Good job.

203
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,257
I was hoping you'd be OK
with this.

204
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:21,061
[thinking and speaking]
For a sec, I thought you
were gonna kick my butt.

205
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,395
[thinking] <i>I did it again.</i>

206
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,464
Now, why on earth
would you think that?

207
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:28,234
This is exactly
what friends are for.

208
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,940
[Satoru] What ya cookin'?
I could smell it when I came in.

209
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,010
Oh, nothing much.
Just a big, fat pot
of curry is all.

210
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,080
I had a feeling you'd be
bringing over a couple
of friends tonight.

211
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,883
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>My mom can read me</i>
<i>like a book.</i>

212
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,652
[Sachiko] Don't just
stand there, pull up a chair.

213
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,153
Would you like some curry?

214
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,623
‐Yes, please.
‐It smells yummy.

215
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:54,327
It's good I brought everyone
'cause you made a ton.

216
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:58,298
If you didn't, you'd be eating
curry for the rest of the month.

217
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,368
Um, Ms. Fujinuma.

218
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:06,973
I brought this back.
It was delicious.

219
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,745
[Sachiko] Well, my job's done
for the night.

220
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,681
[chuckles] Have fun washing
the dishes, kiddo.

221
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,149
[Satoru] Thanks, Mom.

222
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,119
‐See you later.
‐Bye‐bye.
‐Later, guys.

223
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,121
[line rings]

224
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:26,392
Mr. Yashiro?
This is Satoru Fujinuma's mom.

225
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,928
Actually, I do.

226
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,997
Satoru just brought Kayo back
to my place and she's OK.

227
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,534
Ah, what a relief.
That's good to hear.

228
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,736
I knew they were in this
together.

229
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:38,171
[Sachiko] <i>Yeah, it's great,</i>
<i>but...</i>

230
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,106
what happens to her now?

231
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,375
Will she be put
in foster care?

232
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,410
[Gaku] <i>Good question.</i>

233
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,048
<i>You know, I've been thinking</i>
<i>about it and I might have</i>
<i>an idea.</i>

234
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:52,252
No. We tried to,
but her mother wasn't home.

235
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:55,756
Maybe you can help.
But only if you don't mind.

236
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,358
Seven a. m.?

237
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,594
OK, see you tomorrow.

238
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,065
Hey, Kayo,
you want to spend the night?

239
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,499
Mm‐hmm.

240
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:11,505
[phone line rings]

241
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,773
[Gaku] Hello?

242
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:14,575
I'm sorry to call so late.

243
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:18,512
I'm Gaku Yashiro, a teacher
at Mikoto Elementary.

244
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:21,347
I need to talk to you
about Kayo.

245
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:25,586
He's called Wonder Guy.
Isn't he cool?

246
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:29,122
[Sachiko] OK, guys, bath time.
Who wants to go first?

247
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,592
[Satoru] I'll go after you.

248
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:36,563
You know what,
how about we go together?

249
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:45,506
Hey, Kayo, come here
and let me wash your hair.

250
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,208
Um, no, thank you.
I can do it.

251
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,612
[Sachiko] It's OK, I want to.

252
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:55,849
How are we doing, miss?
Are we feeling fabulous yet?

253
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,784
[both giggle]

254
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:01,187
And now it's time for...

255
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,389
‐Tickle‐tickle‐tickle‐tickle!
‐[Kayo laughs]

256
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,827
[Sachiko] And more tickles!

258
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:12,733

[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Hello! You're 29.</i>

260
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,341
[Sachiko] We better
dry your hair or you're
gonna catch a cold.

261
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,216
Um, you guys, like,
have a good bath?

262
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:34,588
Yeah. It was lots of fun.

263
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,890
That's good.

264
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,192
Wait... those your pajamas?

265
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,194
Now they are.
I bought them for her.

[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Witch!</i>

267
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,231
These are fresh
and ready to go.

268
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,001
‐They're super soft.
‐Thank you.

269
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:50,136
Have you done this before?

270
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,872
You've gotta pull
your end tight.

271
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,074
This totally reminds me,

272
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,442
the class took a trip
to Hakodate

273
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,912
and the view from the top
of the mountain was rad.

274
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,815
[Sachiko] What? You've never
been to Hakodate.

275
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:06,019
‐[adult Satoru thinking] Crap!
‐Must have been a photo I saw.

276
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,521
[Sachiko] O... K.

277
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:11,091
‐You ready for lights‐out?
‐[both] Yes.

[Kayo giggles]

279
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,394
What's so funny?

280
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,229
My house doesn't have
a nightlight.

281
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,999
Oh, yeah?
I can turn it off if you want.

282
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:23,870
‐Uh‐uh. It's fine like this.
‐Why don't we leave it
on tonight?

283
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,739
You got it.

284
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,509
Thanks, Satoru.

285
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,343
[Sachiko] Good night, guys.

‐[Kayo] Good night.
‐[Satoru] Good night, Mom.

‐[Satoru] Yep.
‐[Kayo] No, of course not!

‐[adult Satoru thinking]
Oh, there I go again...
‐[thwack!]

290
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,034
[Satoru] What'd you do
that for?
‐[Sachiko] Oops.

291
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,503
‐I meant to do this. And this!
‐[thwack!]
‐[Satoru] Ow! Stop it!

‐[Kayo, tired] Morning.
‐[Sachiko] You awake?

If you are, shake a leg.
Breakfast is gonna get cold.

[Satoru] I'm starving.

Wait, no curry?

302
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,017
[Sachiko] That's your dinner,
for the next month.

303
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,920
[Satoru] What?
There can't be that much left.

304
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,455

invite everyone over again.

Where the hell have you been?!

I'll show...

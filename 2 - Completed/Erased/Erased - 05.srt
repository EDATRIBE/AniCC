3
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,983
<i>Maybe she was up all night</i>

‐[teacher] Satoru?
<i>‐Yeah.</i>

5
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,987
‐Satoru?
‐Huh? Yes, sir!

6
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:24,157

on your mind?

Open up, it's me!

12
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,508
Kayo!

<i>Oh, no.</i>

15
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,430
<i>Too big to be a kid's.</i>

16
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,333
<i>It snowed two nights ago.</i>

17
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,935
<i>And these tracks are fresh.</i>

18
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:13,206
<i>Whoever was here was an adult.</i>
<i>Probably male.</i>

19
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,379

Now what do we do?

<i>I didn't go back to school</i>

<i>Huh. I guess Mom went</i>
<i>to the store.</i>

25
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:28,174
I found out a kid got snatched
not too long ago

26
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,576
over in the next town.

27
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,812
But the cops already caught
that scumbag.

28
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:36,082
This guy is someone new.
We have to warn people
before he does it again.

29
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,052
The problem is the police put
a gag order on the story.

30
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,356
What about airing it
when kids aren't watching?
The station could do that easy.

31
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,292
And I can go talk to the school
and see if they'll issue
a warning.

32
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:51,264
‐[Sawada] OK. I'll talk
to the boss about your idea.
‐[Sachiko] I'd appreciate it.

33
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,569
<i>He's a reporter</i>
<i>for Ishikari TV.</i>
<i>My Mom used to work with him.</i>

34
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:00,240
The last thing I want
is for Satoru to grow up with
horrible memories like this.

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,642
[Sawada] I hear you.

36
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,378
<i>Making me forget was her idea.</i>

37
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,482
I know you're worried,
but you gotta eat something.

38
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,785
What happened
isn't your fault, kiddo.

39
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:15,255
[Satoru] I tried
but I couldn't help her.

40
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,057
I don't know about that.

41
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,426
[Satoru] I just... I didn't
want her to be alone.

42
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,696
And thanks to you,
she wasn't.

43
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:26,299
[Satoru] It wasn't enough.
I should have done more.

44
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,169
[Sachiko] Look,
what happened happened.

45
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,972
So it's pointless to beat
yourself up about it.

46
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:36,242
In a situation like hers,
there’s only so much
anyone could have done.

47
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,545
That goes for you and me.

48
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,747
You should go back
to school tomorrow.

49
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,518
‐You'll just feel worse
staying here alone.
‐[Satoru] OK.

50
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,120
Good. Now eat up, OK?

51
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,955
[Satoru] Yeah.

52
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,660
[teacher] I, uh,
have a confession.

53
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,064
The other day, I told you Kayo
was home with a cold.
That's not true.

54
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:02,435
She's staying with
her grandmother in Sapporo
for personal reasons.

55
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,872
It happened so fast,
she didn't have a chance
to say goodbye.

56
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,241
But don’t worry,
I hear she's doing well.

57
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,611
[bell chiming, kids chatting]

58
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,212
[girl 1] She ran away.

59
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,148
[girl 2] I heard Kayo's mom
hit her with a broom.

60
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,750
[girl 3] Oh, my God, really?

61
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,985
[girl 2] It's better
she's with her grandma.

62
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,921
[Kazu] Hey, Satoru.

63
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,189
‐Cheer up, man.
‐Yeah, don't worry.

64
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,425
‐You'll see her again.
‐Mm‐hmm.

65
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:30,564
[teacher] Satoru, the school
and the PTA talked about it

66
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,198
and decided this was
for the best.

67
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,836
I hate to ask this, but could
you go along with the story?

68
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,103
[Satoru] Sure.

69
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,439
[teacher] I'm sorry.

70
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,743
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>The press couldn't</i>
<i>talk about it either.</i>

71
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:47,981
<i>And for the past few days,</i>
<i>the police had a car parked</i>
<i>outside Kayo's house.</i>

72
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:53,520
<i>They were watching it because</i>
<i>they pegged her mom</i>
<i>as the prime suspect.</i>

73
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,860
<i>Then, six days</i>
<i>after Kayo disappeared...</i>

74
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,533
Listen up, everyone,
I have an announcement.

75
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,101
From now on,
when you leave school,

76
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,537
make sure you're either
with your parents...

77
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,905
<i>...the next girl was kidnapped,</i>

78
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,474
<i>sooner than</i>
<i>she should have been.</i>

79
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,112
[Kenya] You hear
about Aya Nakanishi?

80
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:23,049
I don't know if you knew her,
but she was a student
at Izumi Elementary.

81
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,317
[Satoru] I heard.

82
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,086
I have a friend who goes there

83
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,989
and he said she ran away to go
live with her grandfather.

84
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,693
She did, huh?
Just like Kayo.

85
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,829
She didn't run away.
That’s a lie.

86
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:41,768
If you ask me, there's
a kidnapper on the loose.

87
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,607
<i>The details might not be</i>
<i>exactly the same,</i>

88
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:53,313
<i>but things were definitely</i>
<i>following the same flow</i>
<i>of time as before.</i>

89
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:58,619
<i>Stations ran stories</i>
<i>on the missing girls all day,</i>
<i>except Ishikari TV.</i>

90
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,822
<i>They only ran them early</i>
<i>in the morning and late</i>
<i>at night.</i>

91
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:06,527
<i>So parents were advised</i>
<i>to have their kids watch</i>
<i>Ishikari TV only.</i>

<i>I noticed something.</i>

94

<i>The cops had dialed back</i>
<i>their stakeout at Kayo's place.</i>

95

00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,340
<i>If I was in his shoes,</i>
<i>I'd do the same.</i>

161
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,242
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

162
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,815
Uggh!

163
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:01,054
‐[motorbike puttering]
‐[Airi] You're an idiot.

164
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,391
[Satoru] Airi?

165
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,995
No way! You called me
by my first name?
That's a first.

166
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:12,799
You know, if you're on the run,
you shouldn't leave
your phone on.

167
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,368
The police can use GPS
to track you.

168
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,538
Oh.

169
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:21,107
Are you just gonna sit there?
Hop on, let's go.

170
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,976
Come on, shake a leg.

171
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,386
[Satoru] Sorry about this,
Katagiri.

172
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,588
[Airi] Call me Airi.

173
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,923
It's one of the perks
of riding tandem.

174
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,192
[Satoru] I can't believe
you let me in your house.

175
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,294
You do know why
they're after me, right?

176
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,363
The cops came to see
the manager today.

177
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,498
I overheard them
talking about it.

178
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:49,202
‐It was on the news, too.
‐Then why did you risk
helping me get away?

179
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,204
[Airi] 'Cause you didn't
kill her, that's why.

180
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:56,009
At dinner, I could see how much
you guys meant to each other.
That's a fact.

181
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,512
Yeah, well...

182
00:12:58,512 --> 00:12:59,980
Thank you.

183
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,515
You don't have to thank me.

184
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,283
I can't imagine what you're
going through,

185
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,051
and to have the cops
after you, too?

186
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,953
You don't deserve that.

187
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:11,257
No one deserves the kind of
stuff you've been through
before, either.

188
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,492
What?

189
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,397
[Airi] This. You left it behind
at work the other day.

190
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,567
One of the chapters had
a stickie so I went ahead
and read it.

191
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,737
Talked all about what happened
in your hometown
when you were a kid,

192
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:27,073
how Kayo Hinazuki
was murdered.

193
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,009
I cried when I read it.

194
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,045
She died the day
of the Girls Festival.

195
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,379
It says that?

196
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,583
Yeah. It says she died
on March 3rd.

197
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:41,154
Anyway, make yourself at home.

198
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,591
I have to take the bike back
before they miss it.

199
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:48,161
And don't even think
about leaving this room.

200
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:56,269
[Satoru thinking] <i>This isn't</i>
<i>how it was before.</i>

201
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,239
<i>It changed.</i>
<i>I changed it.</i>

202
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,375
<i>If I can go back again,</i>
<i>I can save Kayo.</i>

203
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,656
<i>Oh, yeah, I'm in Airi's room.</i>

204
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,257
[Airi] <i>"Dear Satoru,</i>

205
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,626
<i>I think I should stick</i>
<i>to my normal schedule today,</i>

206
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,928
<i>so I'm going in to work</i>
<i>my usual shift.</i>

207
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,598
<i>The fam said they'd be</i>
<i>leaving the house around 10</i>

208
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:28,101
<i>and won't be coming back</i>
<i>till after 8 tonight.</i>

209
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:32,205
<i>The key to the house</i>
<i>and my bike are next</i>
<i>to my clock.</i>

210
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,775
<i>Here's the number to my cell.</i>

211
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:39,112
[Satoru thinking] <i>Wait.</i>
<i>I thought her last name</i>
<i>was Katagiri.</i>

212
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,148
[Takahashi] Thank you,
Mr. Nishizono!

213
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,885
I can't tell you how much
we appreciate it.

214
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:49,389
[Gaku] Well, your father's
done so much for me,
I wish I could do more.

215
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,258
Oh, God, no, believe me,
you've done enough.

216
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,160
Heck, my dad couldn't
be happier.

217
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,563
Thanks to that stoplight
and crosswalk you approved,

218
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,065
we get more customers now
than ever before.

219
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,301
[Gaku] Please.
Your business is doing well

220
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,403
because your father is
a shrewd businessman.

221
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,373
All I did was give him
a little boost, that's all.

222
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,744
Besides, it's a school route.
Safety first, you know.

223
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,480
The city council's been talking
about putting a stoplight here
for ages.

224
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,317
I left the receipts by the till.
Heading home.

225
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,086
Sure. Nice hustle today, Airi.

226
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,089
‐What you got there?
‐[Airi] Oh, just some
leftover pizza.

227
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,393
Leftovers, are you kidding?
Go on, get a fresh one.
My treat.

228
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,130
Thanks for the offer, boss,
but this will do.

229
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,298
My friend won't know
the difference anyway.

230
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,168
Oh, uh, I hope
she likes it, then.

231
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,671
That is, if your friend's
a, you know, girl.

232
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:41,642
[Airi] Yeah, well...
see you tomorrow.

233
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:43,009
[chuckles softly]

234
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,746
[Gaku] She’s a cute girl, huh?

235
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:49,249
[Takahashi] Yeah, I guess,
if you're into
that sort of thing.

236
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:52,553
I mean she's 17.
She's just a kid.

237
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:56,122
[Gaku] Yeah, well... I should
get back to the office.

238
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,960
Thanks for stopping by, sir.

239
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:15,108
[Takahashi] Hey, Airi!

240
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,111
‐What's up?
‐Here. You forgot to take this.

241
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,881
It is part of the promotion
after all.

242
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:22,616
Oh. OK, thanks.

243
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:25,786
I was wondering, have you talked
to Satoru lately?

244
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:29,523
‐No.
‐I can't believe he'd just up
and kill his own...

245
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,558
I mean, you know
what they're saying he did.

246
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:34,628
‐It's not like the guy at all.
‐No, it isn't.

247
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,530
I don't know how tight
you guys were,

248
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,133
‐but if you see him, do what
you can to help him, OK?
‐Sure.

249
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,804
Let him know we're on his side.
And if you talk to him,
give me a shout.

250
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:46,773
Yeah, I totally will.

251
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,547
[Satoru thinking]
<i>What am I doing?</i>

252
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,682
<i>I doubt I'm gonna find</i>
<i>anything.</i>

253
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,487
<i>A kid disappeared here.</i>
<i>Three years ago.</i>

254
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,890
<i>Yeah, I think I remember this.</i>

255
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,060
<i>And three weeks later,</i>
<i>they arrested some guy for it.</i>

256
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,597
<i>Even after the trial,</i>
<i>he swore he was innocent.</i>

257
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,768
<i>It's a hell of a coincidence.</i>

258
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,137
<i>Or... is it?</i>

259
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,319
Why would you wanna go
and call the police for?

260
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,088
[Takahashi] Airi!

261
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,658
Is that why you wanted me
to help Satoru?

262
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:40,961
You said you were on his side.
You said that!

263
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:44,064
Wait a sec, Airi.
I just...

264
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,299
I was worried about you,
that's all.

265
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:55,408
If all you wanted was to
get him caught, you should
have told me the truth!

266
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,612
I trusted you!
I trusted you and you
lied to me!

267
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:02,348
[Takahashi] I didn't want
to see you get hurt, I swear.

268
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:07,120
‐[Airi] That I believe.
‐I'm sorry.

269
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,322
[Airi] Boss, please...

270
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,825
If you're really worried
about me,

271
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,927
then don't call the police
over here.

272
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,863
I don't want my family
getting involved in this.

273
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,677
[Airi] I'm sorry, Satoru.

274
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:34,180
[Satoru] Nah, it's no big deal.
I got to sleep a bit,

275
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,651
so thanks for letting me stay
and conk out on your floor.

276
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,554
[Airi] No, don't mention it.
I just wish you could go back.

277
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,689
[Satoru] It's OK.
It's better if I don't.

278
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:46,426
By the way, that's not
your parents' house, is it?

279
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:49,663
[Airi] Huh‐uh. I'm staying
with my uncle and his wife.

280
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,532
My town doesn't have
a high school.

281
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:54,701
It's out in the boonies,
so I had to come
to the city for it.

282
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:58,872
I asked my uncle and he said
I could stay with them in Chiba.

283
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:02,042
‐[Satoru] Mind if I ask
a weird question?
‐[Airi] Hmm‐mm.

284
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:07,213
Like, why do you believe me?
You don't even know me
all that well.

285
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,951
You're right, I don't,
but I don't care.

286
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:13,153
I want to believe you.

287
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,456
<i>When I was</i>
<i>in elementary school,</i>

288
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:19,359
<i>my dad took me</i>
<i>grocery shopping one day.</i>

289
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,999
<i>The owner stopped my dad</i>
<i>and accused him</i>
<i>of stealing a candy bar.</i>

290
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,435
<i>Like I said, my town's small,</i>
<i>so the owner knew my dad.</i>

291
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,773
<i>He said if he just admitted</i>
<i>stealing it, he'd drop</i>
<i>the whole thing.</i>

292
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:36,543
<i>But he refused, and the owner</i>
<i>kept pushing him.</i>

293
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:39,112
<i>I never heard my dad</i>
<i>yell before,</i>

294
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,347
<i>but that day he went off.</i>

295
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,150
<i>The owner ended up</i>
<i>calling the police.</i>

296
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,820
<i>And since my dad belonged</i>
<i>to the local farmers' co‐op,</i>

297
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,256
<i>they gave him a three‐month</i>
<i>suspension as punishment.</i>

298
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,526
You didn't steal it, Daddy.
I know!

299
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:55,161
I saw, you didn't do
anything wrong!

300
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,599
<i>After what happened,</i>
<i>Dad quit the co‐op,</i>

301
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,134
<i>divorced Mom, and left.</i>

302
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:04,037
<i>I guess my Mom thought</i>
<i>he really stole it.</i>

303
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,239
<i>Like everyone else in town.</i>

304
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,712
If someone believes in you,
you're not alone.

305
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:15,616
And if I was in
your situation, I'd want
someone to believe me.

306
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,952
I think you should go home.

307
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,822
Tell the cops
I forced you to hide me.
They'll buy that story.

308
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:25,091
God, you're an idiot.
You can't deal with this
on your own.

309
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,893
And I won't lie to the police.

310
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:31,297
‐OK, but could you not call me
an idiot anymore?
‐[Airi giggles]

311
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,433
[Airi in singsong] No promises!

312
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:37,303
I'll be back in a sec
with a change of clothes
and stuff for you.

313
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,143
[Airi thinking] <i>The boss didn't</i>
<i>call the police after all.</i>
<i>Good for him.</i>

314
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:45,378
[phone chimes]

315
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,853
But...

316
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,387
it can't be.

317
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,390
What is this?

318
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,161
It can't be from him
'cause he told me
his mom's phone was gone.

00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,863
Unless he found it.

[Airi thinking]
<i>No, it's from the killer.</i>

321
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:07,100
<i>He's after me now.</i>

323
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,406
Oh, my God!

324
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,011
Gotta get out!

325
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,714
I gotta... [screams]

326
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,783
[coughing]

327
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,561

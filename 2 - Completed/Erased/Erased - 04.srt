<i>March 1st, 18 years ago.</i>

00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:13,647
<i>On my way home, I saw Kayo</i>
<i>standing alone in the park.</i>

3
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:16,416
<i>I guess it was</i>
<i>a little before 6:00.</i>

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,187
<i>That night I was on my way</i>
<i>to the hideout.</i>

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,390
<i>I think it was</i>
<i>to try and find my gloves.</i>

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,628
<i>But I don't remember if I</i>
<i>found them there or not.</i>

7
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:32,032
<i>After I left, I saw Yuuki</i>
<i>sitting by himself on the bank,</i>

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,501
<i>looking out at the river.</i>

9
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,402
<i>On the way back home,</i>

10
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:39,372
<i>I took a shortcut that took me</i>
<i>by the park again.</i>

11
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,309
<i>But this time when I looked in,</i>
<i>Kayo was gone.</i>

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,649
[teacher] Let's talk
about averages.

13
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,417
<i>A week from now,</i>
<i>Kayo will be the first victim</i>

14
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:54,454
<i>in a series</i>
<i>of kidnappings and murders.</i>

15
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,657
<i>Day X.</i>

16
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,526
<i>If I can get her</i>
<i>to survive March 1st</i>

17
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,995
<i>and spend the 2nd with me</i>
<i>at my birthday party,</i>

18
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,131
<i>that should be enough</i>
<i>to change her future.</i>

19
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,803
<i>I'm not gonna let her die.</i>

23
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,266
Good morning,
you sleepy head.

24
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,534
Morning.

25
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,003
Up and at 'em.
Food's almost ready.

26
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,805
[yawns] OK.

27
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,740
Thanks for breakfast.

28
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,177
Uh, hey, Mom?

29
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,679
[Sachiko] Hmm?

30
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,281
[Satoru] I was thinking
of going out this Saturday.

31
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,549
[Sachiko] Like on a date?

32
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,950
[Satoru] No! I was gonna go

33
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,219
to the Science Center
with some friends.

34
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,723
[Sachiko chuckling]
Oh, well. If it were a date,
I'd give you spending cash.

35
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,558
[adult Satoru]
<i>Shit, for real?</i>

36
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,094
‐It is a date, isn't it?
‐Mm‐hmm.

37
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,362
[Sachiko] Then bring her by.
I'd love to meet her.

38
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,298
We can have hotpot
or something.

39
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,901
Actually, I invited Kayo
to the party.

40
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,970
Oh. Kayo from
a few streets over, huh?

41
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,373
<i>Damn, she's good at getting</i>
<i>info out of people.</i>

42
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,143
[Sachiko] You can go.
Just be safe.

43
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,912
Thanks, Mom.

44
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,047
Hurry up and finish
your breakfast, kiddo.

45
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,516
Mm‐hmm.

46
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:39,352
‐[girl] Stand... bow.
‐[students] Bye!

47
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,855
Liveman's gonna be on.
Cool, huh?

48
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,324
‐[boy 1] What's a falcon?
‐[boy 2] It's a bird, duh!

49
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,392
[girl] You're so smart.

50
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,030
<i>This Saturday,</i>
<i>Kayo's not staying home.</i>

51
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,535
<i>I'm gonna take her away</i>
<i>from her mom and the beatings.</i>

52
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,302
‐[girl] Mr. Yashiro?
‐[boy] Um, sir?

53
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,604
What's up, guys?

54
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,573
Can you explain this?
I don't get it.

55
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,042
Sure. Hmm. That's a tough one.

56
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,911
[growls] What a bunch
of flirty little tramps.

57
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,346
Ecch.

58
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,448
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,351
It's not like you never
did that too, you know.

60
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,588
Instead of dissing him, go up
there and show him who's boss.

61
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,457
What's "dis" mean?
You trying to sound cool?

62
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,626
<i>Oh! Gotta watch what I say.</i>

63
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,163
[Misato] The teacher doesn't
care about me anymore,
he thinks I'm a thief.

64
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,166
Bet you do, too.

65
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,934
Not that I care.

66
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,974
[Satoru] Hey, guys,
I got an idea.

67
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,241
Oh, yeah? What is it?

68
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,779
[Satoru] Um, let's go to
the Science Center on Saturday.

69
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,348
‐I'll ask Kayo to go, too.
‐Yeah, that's a great idea!

70
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,718
‐Ohhh!
‐I can't make it.

71
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,887
Sorry, but I've already
made plans that day.

72
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,288
[Satoru] Oh, really?

73
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,023
Uh, same for me, too, dude.

74
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,158
I, uh, got some important things
need doing.

75
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:56,262
Yeah, what he said.
I'd like to go,
but I can't either. Sorry.

76
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,331
‐Yeah, me too.
‐[Satoru] Oh.

77
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,401
[Kazu] It's better if it's
just you and Kayo anyway.

78
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,637
[Osamu] See ya.

79
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,907
[Kayo] Satoru, everything OK?

80
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,075
Oh, yeah.

81
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,545
[speaking and thinking]
I told them I couldn't
hang out Saturday

82
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,213
'cause I had a date
with you.

83
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,115
[thinking] <i>What a lie.</i>

84
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,417
<i>I did it again.</i>

85
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:23,824
But... my mom wants me to get
home early Saturday, so...

86
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,259
I just wanna take you
someplace cool.

87
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,995
I'll ask her
and get permission.

88
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,598
[teacher] Kenya.

89
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,835
Could I see you in
the faculty office for a sec?

90
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,038
[Akemi] No way. You kids are
too young to go out on a date.

91
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,675
[Satoru] But it's more
like a field trip.
We'll be learning stuff.

92
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,944
You can stay home
and learn stuff.

93
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,147
Besides, Kayo helps me
around the house Saturdays.

94
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,982
Oh, yeah, with what?

95
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,317
[adult Satoru]
<i>Blowing off steam?</i>
<i>Your right hook?</i>

96
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,120
Little smart ass, I don't
have to tell you a damn thing.

97
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,490
[Satoru] I just wanna know
why you don't want Kayo
to go with me.

98
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,225
[Akemi] I got
a zillion reasons why.

99
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,261
First, you guys are too young
to be dating.

100
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,197
Second, who's responsible
if something happens? You?

101
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,400
[adult Satoru]
<i>Don't even go there</i>
<i>with me, bitch.</i>

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,969
[Akemi] What's your problem?

103
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,171
What do you get
out of taking her anywhere?

104
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,973
She's just a gloomy little girl.

105
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,042
I'm not getting anything.
All I want's to keep her safe!

106
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,310
Safe, huh?

107
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,346
What do you think
you're keeping her safe from?

108
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,315
You her knight
in shining armor?

109
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,884
[adult Satoru]
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

110
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,486
<i>Now she knows I know</i>
<i>she beats on her.</i>

111
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:31,057
What do you want to do, Kayo?
You wanna go out with him?

112
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,564
Uggh! You're not going
anywhere, you slut!

113
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,499
[Satoru] Mom!

114
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,167
Watch it, Ms. Hinazuki.

115
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,337
You shouldn't say nasty things
like that about your daughter.

116
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,240
Ms. Fujinuma, I...

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,511
This isn't any of your business.

118
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,313
Actually, half of this
is my business.

119
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,917
A trip to the Science Center
can be very educational
for a kid.

120
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,785
Don't you think
we should encourage that?

121
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,087
We are their parents.

122
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,791
I'm a single mom, too, so I know
how tough it can get.

123
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,860
Come by sometime
and we'll talk.

124
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,532
Kayo, get inside.

125
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,833
[Kayo] OK.

126
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,669
So, Saturday, I'll see you then.

127
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,838
[door creaks shut]

128
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,108
Did I screw everything up?

129
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,044
No. You were great.

130
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,480
[Sachiko] Guess it's lucky
I showed up when I did.

131
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,552
I got off work early
and saw you, so naturally
I had to follow you.

132
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,019
[Satoru] What do you mean
"naturally"?

133
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,156
Oh, nothing.
I'm just kidding, is all.

134
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:40,527
Anyway, you don't have to worry
about Kayo tonight.

135
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,196
Did you notice how nice
her clothes were?

136
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:47,133
Her mom goes to a lot of trouble
to make her look presentable.

137
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,503
[Satoru] Do you know what's
going on over there?

138
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,639
[Satoru] I didn't, but after
what I just heard and saw,

139
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,508
I have my suspicions.

140
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,210
[adult Satoru]
<i>My mom wasn't a reporter</i>
<i>for nothing.</i>

141
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,714
‐[Sachiko] Kayo's a cutie,
isn't she?
‐Uh...

142
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,683
[adult Satoru]
<i>Dude, you're 29!</i>

143
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:06,653
‐[Sachiko chuckles]
‐[Sachiko] Hang in there,
kiddo, for her.

144
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,556
[Satoru] I will.

145
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,559
[adult Satoru] <i>It's Saturday,</i>
<i>February the 27th.</i>

146
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:16,496
<i>It's sunny and clear,</i>
<i>and for the last couple days,</i>

147
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:21,702
<i>Kayo's mom</i>
<i>hasn't beaten her up,</i>
<i>just like my mom said.</i>

148
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,870
[Satoru] Lookit, he's my friend.

149
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,471
[Kayo] You're an idiot.

150
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:29,643
[Satoru] Isn't this place
the coolest?
I love it!

151
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:33,213
I think we're
the only ones here.

152
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,917
[Satoru]
When it's quiet like this,
I pretend I snuck in.

153
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:40,987
Then, if someone comes,
I hide from them.

154
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,957
[adult Satoru]
<i>Huh. She didn't call me</i>
<i>an idiot.</i>

155
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,959
Take a look inside this thing.

156
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,634
You wanna check out the next
show in the planetarium?

157
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:07,180
We already saw
enough stars on the mountain.

158
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,116
Yeah, I guess.

159
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,686
Hey, I have to use
the bathroom.

160
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,021
[Kayo] OK. I'll be here.

161
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,961
[adult Satoru]
<i>What the heck was that</i>
<i>feeling back there?</i>

162
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,732
<i>It was like déjà vu.</i>

163
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,069

Satoru, thanks for inviting me
to come today.

168

<i>Wait, did I?</i>

170
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,458
<i>Is that why I chose it?</i>

171
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,228
<i>Or...</i> [with Kayo] <i>is this</i>
<i>someplace special for me/you,</i>

172
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,164
<i>'cause like I/you wanna</i>

‐[Satoru gasps]

180

181
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,059

‐OK.

184
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,377

‐I could swing by your place.
‐[Kayo] OK.

We blew off the last time
we had cleaning duties.

00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:20,674
[Satoru] I guess.

[Sachiko] I helped out a little,

[kids laugh]

300
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,494
So then, today,
those chores were planned, too?

301
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,463
Uh‐huh. We asked Mr. Yashiro
to stall you.

302
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,100
He also told us it was
Kayo's birthday today.

surprise worked, huh?

[Satoru] Uh, yeah.

Guess what, Kayo.

306

Satoru insisted on getting
a cake just for you.

307
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,413
I'm sorry, Satoru.
I tried.

308

But I couldn't finish
your present in time.

Seriously? You were
making me something?

I'm glad I got to be friends

I'll give you your present
tomorrow.

<i>It worked!</i>

340
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,262
<i>I changed history.</i>

341
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:38,271
<i>Everyone had left</i>
<i>by the time I got home.</i>

342
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,475
<i>I was so exhausted</i>
<i>from the past few days,</i>

343
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:45,612
<i>all that built‐up tension</i>
<i>finally popped.</i>

344
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:49,850
<i>I collapsed on my futon</i>
<i>and slept like a log.</i>

I'm here, sir, sorry!

347
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,962
Just in time. I was about
to mark you tardy.

[teacher] OK. Does anyone know
if Kayo's coming today?

351
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:24,651
<i>Kayo didn't show up that day.</i>
<i>Or the next one.</i>

352
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:27,821
<i>And that promise she made me...</i>

353
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,657
<i>she never got to keep it.</i>

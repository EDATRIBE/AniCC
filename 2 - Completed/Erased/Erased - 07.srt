You've always been friendly,
but before it sort of seemed

like you were,

the new you better.

So after all that, the reason
I wanted to talk to you

00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,113
is 'cause I have a question.

77
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:26,452
Satoru, who are you?

78
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,324
It's like you've turned
into a totally different person.

79

Or like there's a totally
different person inside you now.

80
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,800
I realized it a few days ago,

81
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,769
when I saw you staring
at Kayo during class.

00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:47,240
I've seen bruises on her
a bunch of times before.

But I never said anything
to anyone about it.

I guess I didn't think it was
any of my business.

what was going on with her,

00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,055
you actually did something.

87
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,124
That took guts.

88
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,393
You decided to help her
without a second thought.

00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,129

‐Here we go!
‐[glass shatters]

167
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:49,242
[man] What in the hell?
Hey, who's there?!

168
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:54,748
<i>That takes care of that.</i>
<i>The cops are gonna be</i>
<i>the perfect alibi for Yuuki.</i>

169
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,860
<i>Now for her.</i>

170
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,962
[car horn blares]

171
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,398
<i>I know how I can keep her</i>
<i>away from Kayo.</i>

172
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,942
<i>One push. Just one push!</i>

173
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,112
[Satoru gasps]

174
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,214
I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

175
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:32,018
What if the fall kills her?

176
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,154
You don't want that.

177
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,357
You'd get caught
and then you can't help anyone.

178
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:43,797
Satoru, I wasn't
just passing by,
I've been following you.

179
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:47,534
The past few days, you've been
so desperate to save Kayo.

180
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,771
I was worried you'd do
something drastic.

181
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,542
I'm sorry about that.
It's just...

182
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,646
I knew tonight was when she was
gonna be in the most danger.

183
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:03,950
Earlier, I watched you huck
a big old rock through
someone's window.

184
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,852
Why did you do that?

185
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,554
Oh. Yeah, that.

186
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,857
I wanted the police there
so I could help someone else.

187
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,760
[siren wailing]

188
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,196
[siren fading]

189
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,702
[Satoru] Kenya,
I really need your help.

190
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:25,739
If we can get the police
involved in this,
they'll stop Kayo's mom.

191
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,942
I don't know, that could stir up
all kinds of trouble.

192
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,677
[Satoru] That's what I'm hoping.

193
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,914
‐But there's a chance
it will backfire on you.
‐I know.

194
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,082
[Satoru] It's just an idea.

195
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,451
I'm still working out
the details.

196
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,888
I don't care what I do
or if the police catch me.

197
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,424
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Or if they lock me up</i>
<i>for good.</i>

198
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,060
I don't care
what happens to me.

199
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,697
As long as Kayo's safe.

200
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,667
[Kenya] Well, just don't
do anything that will
get you arrested.

201
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,468
Your mom will kick your butt.

202
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,706
No she won't.
When she found out what I did,

203
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,742
she'd say, "Nice job, kiddo."

204
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:04,110
Yeah, I guess she would.

205
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,780
All right, what's next?

206
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,483
‐[Satoru] I'm gonna
walk Kayo home.
‐[Kazu] Sure, go for it.

207
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,986
[Hiromi] Yeah, we can handle
the cleaning up.

208
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,589
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>This time I remembered</i>

209
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,059
<i>to put on a jacket</i>
<i>and some gloves.</i>

210
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,595
‐Kayo...
‐Satoru...

211
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:22,963
Me first.

212
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:27,133
I was thinking,
can you let me kidnap you?

213
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,338
You're an idiot.

214
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,009
Yeah, but that's the best
I could come up with.

215
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,116
[Kayo] OK.

216
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:47,988
[Satoru] I was hoping
you would say that.

217
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,565
This is it.

218
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,233
Pretty cool, huh?

219
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,470
Izumi's Elementary's
hockey club used to use it
as their hangout.

220
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,641
[Kenya] Hey, guys.
About time.

221
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,010
[Satoru] Are you sure
this is OK?

222
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,679
Yeah. The school got
a new one last year.

223
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,815
They use this for storage now.

224
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:16,583
[door slides open]

225
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,220
We should open the vents
before lighting the stove.

226
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,558
It's all rusted.

227
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,031
I'll cover the windows,
you hang the blanket.

228
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,432
[Satoru] OK.

229
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,338
‐Cool.
‐[Kayo] Wow!

230
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,641
It's an awesome hideout,
isn't it?

231
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:42,843
I wouldn't mind
living here myself.

232
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:44,645
[Satoru] You'd miss having
a shower, though.

233
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:48,515
Living in a proper house
doesn't guarantee happiness.

234
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,787
Anyway... I should get going.

235
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,355
See you later, Kayo.

236
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,058
I should go home now, too,
but I'll come back later.

237
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,326
I'll knock three times.

238
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:06,533
Thanks, you guys.
I mean it. Thank you.

239
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,069
We're friends. You don't
have to thank me, ever.

240
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:13,173
We're gonna keep you safe,
Kayo, promise.

241
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,576
[footsteps on stairs,
door slides shut]

242
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:20,213
‐[Satoru] Ow!
‐[Kenya] Way to pour on
the charm.

243
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,815
[Satoru] Yeah?
You should talk.

244
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,751
You sounded like you were gonna
ask her out or something.

245
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,953
[Kenya] You know I wouldn't
do that to you.

246
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:30,456
I'm glad she's my friend,
and I know she's glad
she's yours.

247
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,227
Thanks for helping.

248
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:37,163
[Kenya] Like I told her,
you don't have to thank me.

249
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,465
Besides,
the hard part's coming up.

250
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:43,704
[Satoru] Yeah. Listen,
if this does backfire on me,

251
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:46,139
make like you didn't
know anything, OK?

252
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,574
[Kenya] OK.

253
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,515
I didn't think you were
ever coming home.

254
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,183
Sorry.
We stopped along the way.

255
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,285
We got to talking about stuff.

256
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,654
[Sachiko] Stuff, huh?

257
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:03,423
[Satoru] I think her mom
was worried, too.

258
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:06,827
‐She didn't call here, did she?
‐Nope, she didn't.

259
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:09,863
[Satoru] Oh, I have to leave
super early tomorrow,

260
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,198
but don't get up for me.

261
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,134
I'll have this for breakfast.

262
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,302
[Sachiko] Mm‐hmm.

263
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:32,519
[three knocks on door,
Kayo gasps]

264
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,723
Come in.

265
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,527
Did I wake you?

266
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,529
[Kayo] No. I couldn't sleep.

267
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,099
[Satoru] I don't blame you.
You hungry?

268
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,608
[Kayo, mouth full] It's good.

269
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,413
[Satoru] This stuff tastes
better late at night, huh?

270
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,249
[Kayo] I never had them
this late before.

271
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,385
[Satoru] Oh.

272
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,858
You know what?
Me and the guys are gonna
go camping this summer.

273
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,094
If you want, you should come.

274
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,929
I don't know if I can.

275
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,098
Sure you can.

276
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:20,867
Mm‐hmm.

277
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,340
[door slides open]

278
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,977
[footsteps climb stairs]

279
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,713
Wake up.

280
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:34,548
We're gonna be late.

281
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,287
[both gasp]

282
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,923
Good thing I stopped by.

283
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:46,426
Come on, we have to leave before
the kids from Izumi show up.

284
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:51,164
Where is Kayo? Anyone know?

285
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,404
‐[bell chimes]
‐[woman over loudspeaker]
<i>Just a reminder.</i>

286
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:03,043
<i>It's flu season,</i>
<i>so don't forget to wash</i>
<i>your hands before lunch.</i>

287
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:07,047
I thought something
would have happened by now.
What do you think?

288
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:10,450
Has her mom called the police?
Does she even know she's gone?

289
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,953
[Satoru] Maybe she hasn't
looked for her yet.

290
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:16,256
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>The last time,</i>
<i>it was March the 2nd.</i>

291
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,258
<i>I got Kayo home before 9:00.</i>

292
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:21,427
<i>After that, her mom</i>
<i>and the boyfriend beat her.</i>

293
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,063
<i>Then her mom threw her</i>
<i>in the shed,</i>

294
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:25,966
<i>and sometime after 10:00,</i>
<i>Kayo was kidnapped.</i>

295
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:29,936
<i>At 12:30 on the 3rd,</i>
<i>Kayo's mom called up my mom.</i>

296
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:33,940
<i>Then, sometime before dawn,</i>
<i>Kayo was murdered.</i>

297
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,943
<i>This time there</i>
<i>have been major changes</i>

<i>Kayo, her mom, us...</i>
<i>the killer.</i>

299
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,717
<i>Who knows what'll happen next?</i>

300
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:50,390
Yes, this is Gaku Yashiro,
from Mikoto Elementary.

301
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,194
Sure. Yes, I'll hold.

302
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,729

Let's hear it!

‐[coach] One! Two...
‐[kids] One! Two...

304
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,766
[Kenya] Just don't tell
Kazu or Osamu.

305
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,335
[Satoru] Sorry for dragging you
into this, Hiromi.

306
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:05,739
[Hiromi] Oh, that's OK.
I'm just stoked
you guys trusted me.

307
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,575
Besides, my folks
won't get back till 8:00,

308
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,911
so this is better
than sitting home alone.

309
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:14,047
You're a trouper, Kayo.
You must be super bored.

310
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,483
Hmm‐mm. I haven't had
this much fun in forever.

311
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,486
I'm glad I had the guts
to do this.

312
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,889
Tomorrow morning,
I'll stop by your house.

313
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,759
Her mom won't have a choice
but to call the police then.

314
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,094
‐[Satoru] Mm‐hmm.
‐Hey.

315
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:31,364
I get why we're
doing what we're doing,
but what if we get in trouble?

316
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:35,401
Don’t worry about that.
I'll take the blame
for what happens.

317
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:40,607
[Kayo] You're an idiot.
This whole thing
is because of me,

318
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,544
and all you guys are doing
is trying to help.

319
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,783
No one's gonna blame
anyone for that.

320
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:51,417
And I win.

321
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,386
You're right.

325

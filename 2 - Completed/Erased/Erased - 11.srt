00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,745
[Gaku] <i>I'd like to tell you</i>
<i>a little story.</i>

2
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:15,516
<i>It happened a long time ago,</i>
<i>when I was in the sixth grade.</i>

3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:20,453
<i>One day at school,</i>
<i>a girl brought a box</i>
<i>of hamsters to class.</i>

4
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,422
<i>And she was very upset.</i>

5
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:26,627
<i>She said she started with two,</i>
<i>and before she knew it,</i>
<i>they'd bred.</i>

6
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,530
<i>Now she had more</i>
<i>than she could take care of.</i>

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,098
<i>I happily took them for her.</i>

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,534
<i>When I got home that day,</i>

9
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,802
<i>I filled a big wine jug</i>
<i>with water.</i>

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:39,906
<i>Then I dropped the hamsters in</i>
<i>one by one.</i>

11
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,542
<i>When I checked on them</i>
<i>three hours later,</i>

12
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,144
<i>I couldn’t believe my eyes.</i>

13
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:48,181
<i>One hamster was still alive,</i>

14
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,918
<i>standing atop</i>
<i>the drowned corpse</i>
<i>of one of its siblings.</i>

15
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,955
<i>And I was thrilled.</i>

16
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:58,792
<i>I named it Spice and decided</i>
<i>to keep it for my pet.</i>

17
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,094
<i>Why? Because when I saw it</i>
<i>in the jug,</i>

18
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,598
<i>it reminded me of a story</i>
<i>called "The Spider's Thread."</i>

19
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,899
<i>Do you know it?</i>

20
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,034
<i>It's about a sinner in Hell</i>
<i>named Kandata</i>

21
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,705
<i>who, while alive,</i>
<i>once spared a spider's life.</i>

22
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,874
<i>Moved by this act</i>
<i>of compassion,</i>

23
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:17,143
<i>the Buddha lowered</i>
<i>a spider's thread from paradise</i>

24
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,679
<i>down to him.</i>

25
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,947
<i>Kandata started climbing it,</i>
<i>and half way up,</i>

26
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,917
<i>he saw his fellow sinners</i>
<i>climbing after him.</i>

27
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,687
<i>He tried to knock them off,</i>
<i>and then...</i>

28
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,188
[snap!]

29
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,190
<i>the thread snapped,</i>

30
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,794
<i>sending Kandata back down</i>
<i>to Hell.</i>

31
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,496
<i>Now, what I'm about</i>
<i>to tell you next</i>

32
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,431
<i>might sound hard to believe,</i>

33
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,335
<i>but if anyone could understand,</i>
<i>it would be you.</i>

34
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,370
<i>Ever since I met Spice,</i>

35
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,474
<i>I could see the spider's thread</i>
<i>on people.</i>

36
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:52,045
<i>Whomever it touched,</i>
<i>I was compelled to kill.</i>

37
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,916
<i>But then a boy came along</i>
<i>who disrupted my duties.</i>

38
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,452
<i>And wouldn't you know it,</i>
<i>I saw the spider's thread</i>

39
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,622
<i>attached to him.</i>

40
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,390
Yashiro!

41
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,528
I know your future!

42
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:11,898
[Gaku] <i>I tried to kill</i>
<i>the boy, but he didn't die.</i>

43
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,268
<i>So I nicknamed him Spice,</i>

44
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,639
<i>and I kept a close eye on him.</i>

45
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,843
[whispering] <i>That boy</i>
<i>was you, Satoru!</i>

46
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,645
[theme song plays]

47
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,324
[man singing in Japanese]

48
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,575
[Sachiko] That'll be
987 yen, please.

49
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,244
Thanks for shopping with us.

50
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:56,029
[Sachiko thinking]
<i>Satoru mentioned something</i>
<i>to me once about the train.</i>

51
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:01,001
[Satoru] Remember, you don't
have to change trains

52
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,068
to go to Ueno.

53
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,638
[Sachiko thinking]
<i>He was right.</i>

54
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,775
<i>But why did he</i>
<i>point that out to me?</i>

55
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,663
Good morning, kiddo.
Sleep well?

56
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,001
[projector clicks on]

57
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,006
[doctor] Huh.
He's in great shape

58
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,141
for someone who's been
in a coma for 15 years.

59
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:19,680
‐[Sachiko gasps]
‐[Satoru faintly] Fifteen years.

60
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,347
Wow! Talking already.

61
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,618
It won't be long before you can
start physical therapy.

62
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,290
[young Satoru] <i>I heard that</i>
<i>for the past 15 years,</i>

63
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,858
<i>mom spent four hours a day</i>

64
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,595
<i>giving every joint</i>
<i>in my body a workout.</i>

65
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,798
<i>About three years ago,</i>

66
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,934
<i>she got one of those</i>
<i>EMS monitor thingies</i>

67
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,169
<i>to let her know</i>
<i>when I was conscious again.</i>

68
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,140
<i>She got another thing</i>
<i>to stimulate my muscles.</i>

69
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,679
<i>When I was in fifth grade,</i>
<i>I stood about 4½ feet tall.</i>

70
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,749
<i>I'm 5'5" now.</i>

71
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,219
<i>Dr. Kitamura said,</i>
<i>if it wasn't for my mom,</i>

72
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,222
<i>I wouldn't be in</i>
<i>as good a shape as I am.</i>

73
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:06,326
[doctor] This might be difficult
but I think you're ready for it.

74
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,129
Try to answer my next question.

75
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,497
What's the last thing
you can remember,

76
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,734
before you lost consciousness,
that is?

77
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,670
[Satoru] OK.
I remember I was...

78
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,178
[young Satoru] Oh...

79
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,880
Wait.

80
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,214
Damn it.

81
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,688
[young Satoru]
<i>It's like these memories,</i>
<i>whatever they are,</i>

82
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,123
<i>are locked behind a door.</i>

83
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,494
[doctor] That's you.

84
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,666
‐Well, aren't you surprised?
‐Hmm?

85
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,100
Your face has changed a lot.

86
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,703
The last time you saw it,
you were 11.

87
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,506
Well, I guess since
your memories are scrambled,

88
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:56,409
it'll take a while
before this all sinks in.
It's just a matter of time.

89
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,013
[young Satoru] <i>That day,</i>
<i>I thought maybe the doc</i>
<i>was right.</i>

<i>Patience, heart rate monitor,</i>

Good morning, Mom.

100
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,312
[Sachiko] Guess what?
You've got some visitors.

101
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,047
Look who decided
to wake up.

102
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,982
You look great.
How are you feeling?

103
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,820
[young Satoru] <i>I remember</i>
<i>Kenya and Hiromi.</i>

104
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,455
<i>They were two</i>
<i>of my very best friends.</i>

105
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,792
<i>Kenya's a lawyer now</i>
<i>and Hiromi's a doctor.</i>

106
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:49,796
<i>We talked for hours</i>
<i>about this and that.</i>

107
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:55,001
<i>Now and then I got the feeling</i>
<i>Kenya wanted to ask me</i>
<i>something, but he didn't.</i>

108
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,237
<i>Maybe Mom told him not to.</i>

109
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,974
<i>We just talked</i>
<i>about trivial things.</i>

110

‐See ya later.
‐Take it easy.

111
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,115

<i>lots of stuff I wanted</i>
<i>to ask the guys.</i>

112
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:14,588
<i>But Mom being Mom, I bet</i>
<i>she wanted to avoid that</i>
<i>to spare me from the shock.</i>

113
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:19,059
<i>For 15 years, she dedicated</i>
<i>herself to keeping me alive,</i>

114
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,595
<i>hoping I'd wake up one day.</i>

115
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,831
<i>She doesn't want me</i>
<i>to remember what happened.</i>

116
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:28,201
<i>It's probably</i>
<i>a good thing I don't.</i>

[woman] Satoru?

121
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,146
Congratulations, Kayo.

122
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,854
[Kayo] Yeah, I'm married.
My last name is Sugita.

123
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,824
No way.
So Hiromi's a dad now?

124
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,491
‐[Kayo] Mm‐hmm.
‐I got the feeling

125
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:29,162
he wanted to tell me
something important:
now I know what.

126
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,866
He looks just like him.
He's even got the same
long eyelashes.

127
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,636
Yep. He's just like his daddy.

128
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,070
We named him Mirai.

129
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,940
That's a cool name.
It means "the future."

130
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,411
[Kayo] You know, we felt weird
about getting together.

131
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:49,182
It didn't seem right
for us to be happy.

132
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,284
We're alive because
of what you did

133
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,320
and because of us,
you ended up in a coma.

134
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,657
It felt like...

135
00:10:56,657 --> 00:11:00,661
like we were leaving you
behind, I guess.

136
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,964
Kayo, whatever happened
to me happened.

137
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,166
So don't go blaming yourself
about it.

138
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,468
I don't have any regrets,
'cause in the end,

139
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,605
I'm here 'cause it's where
I'm supposed to be.

After being gone for 15 years,
you're still a smooth talker.

Oh, I am?

142
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,214
I get what you're saying,
Satoru,

143
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,718
but before you came along,
I thought I'd always be
alone in life.

144
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,853
And here I am
with my very own family.

145
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:31,457
You made that possible,
so thank you.

<i>"thank you."</i>

Satoru, are you OK?

153
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,717
[Satoru, weakly] Yeah.

154
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,552
I shouldn’t have
sprung all this on you.

155
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,021
It's a lot to process.

156
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,089
Well, we'll see you later.

157
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,325
Yeah, see you later.

00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,942
[door opens]

159
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,444
Hey, kiddo,
you have a good workout today?

160
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:28,314
Uh‐huh. Kayo came by
a little while ago.

161
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,450
[Sachiko] Mm.
I bumped into her outside.

162
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,153
She's got the cutest baby.

163
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,791
[Satoru] Listen, Mom?

164
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,393
What's up?

165
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:44,765
‐Not those assholes again.

be able to walk again?

It depends on you.

to do twice as much rehab.

[Sawada] Matter of fact,
we have.

Come on, you honestly
think he'd remember you?

203

That was like 20 years ago now.

204

since the last time you saw me.

[Manabu] Not at all.
I got married five years ago

for my given name,

but I use
the more common reading now.

Wow. A real‐life politician.

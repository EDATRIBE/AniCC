Kayo! You little shit.
Where the hell have you been?!

00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:26,846
Now, I'll show...

7
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:29,616
I should have known.

8
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:31,751
This was all your doing,
wasn't it?

Who the hell do you think
you are hiding my kid from me?

00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:36,523
I damn near lost
my mind worrying.

11
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:39,559
I'm gonna sue the shit
out of you for this!

12
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:41,828
[Sachiko] She's been gone
three days.

13
00:00:41,828 --> 00:00:44,931
In all that time, did you even
bother looking for her?

14
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:47,133
Wait, what? Are you...?

15
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,702
So now I'm the bad guy?

You goddamn bitch!

17
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:54,541
I'll kill you!

18
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:05,552
Kayo, let go of me!

19
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:07,386
You didn't worry about her.

20
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:10,189
The only person you were
worrying about was yourself.

21
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:11,591
[Akemi] What?

00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,696
You hear me?
I'm talking to you,
you little retard!

26
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:58,831
Ms. Hinazuki, that's enough.

27
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:02,201
Do you think it's fun for her
seeing you act like this?

28
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:06,138
That's your fault.
You called me a piece‐of‐shit
mom in front of my daughter.

29
00:03:06,138 --> 00:03:09,475
Who the hell do you think you
are taking people's kids away?!

30
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:12,979
Shut up! You're the one
that beats her
and throws her in sheds!

31
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:15,281
She's been gone three days
and you've done jack shit!

32
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:19,552
I'm not gonna stand here and get
lectured by you, you brat!

33
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:23,255
You don't know what being
a parent's like.

00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:25,558
Get out of here, you...

00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:27,760
[man] Ms. Hinazuki.

36
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,963
We're with the department
of Child Protective Services.

37
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:33,933
‐[Akemi] Huh?
‐We'd like to speak to you
about your daughter.

38
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:37,737
Now, we could do this
the easy way or the hard way.
It's up to you.

39
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,541
Goddamn the both of you.

40
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,010
You tricked me.

41

[man] Don't blame Ms. Fujinuma.
She's here because we asked her.

42
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:51,383
You've been avoiding us,
so we really didn't have
any other choice.

43
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:53,820
[Akemi] I what?
I wasn't avoiding you.

44
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,455
[man] Regardless,
we're here now.

45
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,127
Thank you. I'm sorry to have to
drag you into this.

46
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:03,229
No, you don't have to be.

47
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:06,165
There were a couple things
I wanted to say to her myself.

48
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:08,735
I'm glad you gave me
the opportunity to.

49
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:11,738
Last I checked, kidnapping
someone's kid was still illegal.

50
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:13,305
You gonna call the cops or what?

51
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,975
No, we're not calling anyone
until we've had a chance

52
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,377
to speak to you
about your daughter's welfare.

53
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:20,412
Huh? What are you talking about?

54
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:22,715
Now that she's back home
with me, she'll be fine.

55
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:24,551
[man] Based on the facts
at hand,

56
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:26,819
I'm afraid we'll have to
take custody of her.

57
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,221
[Akemi] What? I'm her mother,
you asshole.

58
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:33,159
[man] Like the boy said,
she was gone for three days
and you didn't look for her.

59
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,594
What, are you denying that?

60
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:36,763
[Akemi] That son of a...
He's the one who took her!

61

I'm not the criminal here!

‐[man] Ms. Hinazuki, please.
‐[woman] Let's talk calmly
about this.

63
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:45,672
[Akemi] OK, let's
all go talk to the cops.

64
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:47,139
‐[woman] What?
‐[Akemi] You heard me.

65
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,076
They can settle this.
Come on, Kayo.

66
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:52,111
‐[man] Wait, hold on.
‐[woman] Please, calm down.

67
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:54,947
‐[man] Ms. Hinazuki.
‐[woman] You're not helping
your daughter.

68
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:57,016
‐Where are you goin'?
‐[Akemi] goddamn it.

69
00:04:57,016 --> 00:05:00,452
‐[Akemi] Stop dragging
your feet!
‐Kayo.

72
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,161
Akemi.

73
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,898
[Akemi] Mom?

74
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:17,870
[elderly woman] I'm so sorry.

75
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:24,276
It's my fault we haven't spoken
since I made you leave that man.

76
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:29,782
And ever since, I've been
worrying about you and Kayo.

77
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:33,586
I know what it's like trying
to raise a kid all by yourself.

78
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:37,790
All the sacrifices
you have to make.

79
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,326
It must have been tough for you.

80
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:42,194
And lonely too.

81
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:44,997
I should have taken you
both in and helped you.

82
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,909
You had to deal with so much.

83
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,979
I should have
been there for you.

84
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:21,033
Please don't blame her.
This is my fault.

85
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:24,504
If I was around,
this wouldn't have happened.

86
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,144
[Akemi] Mom.

87
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:36,849
Mom...

88
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:39,051
Mom!

Akemi, don't you worry
about Kayo now.

95
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:02,842
I promise you,
I'll take good care of her.

96
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:06,178
[Sachiko] I can't imagine
what you're going through.

97

My child's the most precious
thing I have.

00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:18,958
Thanks, Mr. Yashiro.

101
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:23,596
No. The reason we're all here
is because of you, Satoru.

Ah, he's in hibernation mode.

I have some news.

Kayo's grandmother has
full custody of her now.

And as for Kayo's mother,
the authorities aren't gonna
let her see her for a while.

00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:11,898
Thank you, Mr. Yashiro.

144

Hmm‐mm. It's not about that.

You said it couldn't have ended
any better after what I did
and the courage I showed.

00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,777
I just wanted to let you know
that meant a lot to me.

00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:28,615
Well, actually, I wanted to say

149
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:30,850
you deserved to be rewarded
for your courage,

150
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,719
but that would have
sounded awful.

151
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,186
Not that you
shouldn't be rewarded,

152
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:37,323
because if anyone deserves to be
it's you.

153

I bet seeing Kayo's smile
was your reward, wasn't it?

Your smile was mine.

Oh, by the way,
where was Kayo staying?

‐No, not there. We hid her.
‐Seriously?

00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,944
Yep. We set her up

00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:05,317
that's a perfect place
to take them, huh?

<i>and Hiromi are still in danger.</i>

166
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:20,232
<i>I have to figure out a way</i>
<i>to make sure neither of them</i>
<i>are left alone.</i>

167
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,071
<i>Like how I did with Kayo.</i>

168
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:29,876
<i>Hiromi's my friend</i>
<i>and I'm with him all the time,</i>

169
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,178
<i>but Aya goes to a different</i>
<i>school, and I don't know her,</i>

170
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:34,313
<i>so how do I approach her?</i>

171
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:37,617
<i>I heard she sometimes</i>
<i>hangs out with Yuuki,</i>

172
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,085
<i>so maybe he's my "in."</i>

173
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:42,021
<i>I don't know her,</i>
<i>she doesn't know me.</i>

174
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:44,557
<i>This is gonna be tough.</i>

175
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,762
[Sachiko] Wait, how do you
make friends with someone
you don't know?

176
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:53,299
Easy. Be honest,
and say something like,
"Hey, you, let's be friends."

177
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:55,201
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>That's never gonna‐‐</i>

178
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:57,904
You're thinking
that's never gonna work,
but it might.

179
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:59,539
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Psychic witch!</i>

180
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:02,174
I can't believe you're already
looking for another girlfriend.

181
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:04,276
Uh...
How do you know I am?

182
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:06,846
[Sachiko] I didn't,
but I do now.

183
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:09,315
You're right,
this person's a girl.

184
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:11,117
But I just wanna be her friend.

185
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:14,554
Well, if that's what you want,
then what's the harm
in asking?

186
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:17,824
To get what you want in life,
you have to think positively.

187
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,291
You never know till you try.

188
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:24,797
[Satoru] I have to go somewhere
really quick.

189
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:27,834
Is it cool if I meet you guys
at the Children's Center?

190
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,903
‐[Kenya] Yeah, sure.
‐[Satoru] OK. See you guys
in a little bit.

191
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:33,172
‐[Satoru] Later.
‐[Hiromi] See ya.

192
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:48,254
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Looks like her class</i>
<i>gets out at 6:30.</i>

193
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:51,524
<i>I can walk Hiromi home</i>
<i>and be back here in time.</i>

194
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:55,962
<i>I have to get familiar</i>
<i>with Aya's daily routine.</i>

195
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:10,109
<i>Aya pretty much kept</i>
<i>to a straightforward schedule.</i>

196
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:12,078
<i>If someone wanted</i>
<i>to kidnap her,</i>

197
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,082
<i>the best time would be</i>
<i>right now, after she got out</i>
<i>of cram school.</i>

198
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,750
[Sachiko] Satoru.

199
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,153
I need you muscles.
Come on, shake a leg.

200
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:23,355
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>Why'd she have to show up now?</i>

201
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:25,157
<i>I'm trying to find out</i>
<i>where Aya lives.</i>

202
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:27,393
Why the heck
do you buy all this stuff?

203
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:29,428
Couldn't help it.
It was cheap.

204
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:30,730
It's heavy.

205
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,499
God, stop complaining.
It'll only make it heavier.

206
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:35,502
[Satoru] It would be as heavy
either way.

207
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:39,572
[horn honks]

208
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:41,040
You're a lifesaver, sir.

209
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,142
Mom sort of went nuts
at the store.

210
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:44,911
I did not go nuts.

211
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,013
[teacher chuckles]

212
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:49,516
Ah... [clears throat]

213
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:55,021
So, Mr. Yoshiro,
how come you're not married?

214
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:57,657
That came out of nowhere.

215
00:13:57,657 --> 00:14:00,159
Hmm. It's like this.

216
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,862
Getting married depends
on finding the right partner.

217
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:06,032
It depends on timing
and whether they want
to marry you and...

218
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:08,034
Well, other things.

219
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:11,571
Me, I already failed
horribly at it once,

220
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:13,840
so I guess I'm just being
extra cautious.

221
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,243
Sorry, I didn't mean to, um...

222
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:20,446
[teacher] It's OK.
It's all in the past now.

223
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:27,253
I was wondering if you
could give me some advice.

224
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:30,422
[teacher] How to approach
a girl you don't know, huh?

225
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:33,726
Yeah. I know a couple things
about her, but that's it.

226
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:36,929
Let's see, how would I go
about doing that?

227
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:41,367
I guess I'd get her
to drop her guard first and
that way I won't freak her out.

228
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,135
‐How do I do that?
‐Easy.

229
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:46,372
When you're around her,
be yourself, that's all.

230
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:49,041
Whatever you're into,
be it sports or cooking,

231
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,110
your interests
make you interesting.

232
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,045
Your enthusiasm
will make her curious

233
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:54,947
and then she'll drop
her guard.

234
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:56,215
Wow!

235
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:58,150
I wish it were that impressive.

236
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,452
No, I'm bad at expressing
my feelings directly

237
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:02,722
so I've gotten good
at relying on logic.

238
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:08,561
What's this doing here?

239
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:10,763
[teacher, gasping]
No, no, don't touch it!

240
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:13,099
I didn't mean to...

241
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:15,101
What the...?

242
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:18,070
[teacher] Well...
My secret's out.

243
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:22,775
[adult Satoru thinking] <i>Candy?</i>

244
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:25,645
There's no sense in hiding
the truth anymore.

245
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:28,748
Don't just sit there.
Help me eat the evidence.

246
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:32,451
I quit smoking three years ago,

247
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:36,055
and candy's the only thing
that helps stop the cravings.

248
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:40,026
I find someplace private,
jam a couple of these
in my mouth, and I'm good.

249
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,694
[adult Satoru thinking]
<i>What a weirdo.</i>

250
00:15:41,694 --> 00:15:44,163
Thank you.

251
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:52,471
Can I bum one of those off ya?

252
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:53,706
Sure.

253
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:57,577
[bell chimes]

254
00:15:57,577 --> 00:16:00,379
I'm going over to
the Children's Center
to do my homework.

255
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:04,551
OK, um, if you wait a sec,
I'll go with you.

256
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:08,087
Are you gonna be Hiromi's
bodyguard now that Kayo's gone?

257
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:10,422
It's not like that.

258
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:12,825
[Kenya] Satoru, can I talk
to you for a sec?

259
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:14,393
Uh‐huh.

260
00:16:15,828 --> 00:16:19,699
‐Sorry. I'll catch up
in a few, OK?
‐[Hiromi] Mm‐hmm.

261
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:23,202
[Kenya] I have no idea what's
going on with you lately.

262
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:27,540
You made it your mission
to save Kayo and you did,
so what's bothering you?

263
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,742
You always look so intense,

264
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:32,812
like you're still trying
to fix whatever it is
that needs fixing.

265
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:37,149
If something's bugging you,
I wish you'd just
tell me about it.

266
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,686
I can't really explain
what it is.

267
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:41,688
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

268
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:46,125
[Kenya] Then let me
help you figure it out.

269
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:51,230
I'd like the chance
to be a hero, too.

270
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,166
Whatever you're up to,
I'd like to come along.

271
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:03,876
Check it out.
What do you think
of these footprints?

272
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:06,979
A grown‐up was here.
They came and left.

273
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:08,615
Yeah, but no tread.

274
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:11,117
It's like he wrapped
his shoes in something.

275
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,452
[Kenya] Why? They'd be
super slippy.

276
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:16,388
[Satoru] Maybe to hide
the tread pattern.

277
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,533
Look, the backpack's gone.

278
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:29,536
Crap, the box
with the stove, too.

279
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,804
Quite a few boxes are missing.

280
00:17:31,804 --> 00:17:34,340
And he tore some open.

281
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,777
He didn't want to leave
any evidence behind.

282
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:41,147
Satoru, where are you
going with this?

283
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:44,283
You guys remember
what Kayo told us?

284
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:47,787
‐That night she was here alone
and she heard someone come in?
‐Yeah.

285
00:17:47,787 --> 00:17:51,858
[Kenya] He left a backpack
full of creepy junk. So what?

286
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:55,962
I think that guy, whoever he is,
is a serial killer
who targets kids.

287
00:17:55,962 --> 00:17:58,898
[Kenya] Wait, a serial killer?
You're joking.

288
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:03,369
No, I'm not.
I know it's hard to believe,
but that's what I think.

289
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:06,939
[Hiromi] OK, but like... why?

290
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:09,876
I wish I could explain it
to you guys, but I can't.

291
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:13,279
When I saw the stuff
in the backpack
and the stove and charcoal,

292
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,183
I thought maybe the killer was
using this as their home base.

293
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:18,818
I know, guys.

294
00:18:18,818 --> 00:18:22,121
Everything I just said to you
sounds totally crazy.

295
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:24,190
But even so, I think I'm right.

296
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,426
As for Kayo, the truth is,

297
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:31,297
it wasn't just 'cause
her mom beat her that I didn't
want to leave her alone.

298
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:35,334
I was also protecting her
from the killer.

299
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,875
Jeez. It's so out there,
it's like the plot
of some detective story.

300
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:47,747
But the real issue here
isn't whether we believe
in your theory or not.

301
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:50,883
It's about whether
we believe in you or not.

302
00:18:55,154 --> 00:18:58,357
[Hiromi] You don't have
to walk me all the way home.

303
00:18:58,357 --> 00:18:59,926
I can take care
of myself, you know.

304
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:02,895
[Satoru] I had to swing by here
for something else anyway.

305
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:11,971
‐Satoru?
‐What?

306
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:15,107
[Hiromi] I believe
what you told us before,

307
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:19,445
and I'll do
whatever I can to help out.
You can totally count on me.

308
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:21,113
You're the best.

309
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:26,285
‐[giggles] See ya!
‐Good night, Hiromi.
See you later!

310
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:32,258
[Kenya] I have to be
honest here, Satoru.

311
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:37,096
After hearing your story,
I'm about 99% sure
it's nonsense.

312
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:41,367
But still, there's a 1% chance
everything you said's true.

313
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:45,304
Well, from your point of view,
I get how you think
I'm making it up

314
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:46,873
and just playing detective.

315
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:49,208
[Kenya] You should keep
playing detective.

316
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,779
I don't know what that stuff
we found here was for,

317
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:56,015
but you seem to really believe
something's up,

318
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:58,818
and that makes me think that
you might be onto something.

319
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:00,119
Mm‐hmm.

320
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,489
Besides, you trusted us enough
to tell us about it.

321
00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:07,594
If you believe in us that much,
we believe in you.

322
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:10,196
[Airi] If someone believes
in you, you're not alone.

323
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:14,567
And if I was in your situation,
I'd want someone to believe me.

324
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:20,339
Thank you, Kenya.
You too, Hiromi.

325
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:24,677
You don't get it,
I could have saved her!

<i>Eighteen years ago,</i>

327
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:30,216
<i>I was crying</i>
<i>when I said that to my mom.</i>

328
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:34,654
<i>I don't wanna feel</i>
<i>that kind of guilt again.</i>

329
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:37,456
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who can stop this,</i>

330
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:39,892
<i>the only one who can save them.</i>

Remember to get
your parent's signature.
Don't forget now.

333
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,507
I need you guys to come with me,
but just us, OK?

334
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:56,876
[both] Mm‐hmm.

335
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:59,912
Hey, Satoru, today's a good day
to go to the hideout.

336
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:02,549
Actually, we have to take care
of something.

337
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:04,316
‐[Kazu] Hmm?
‐[Kenya] Sorry about that.

338
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:07,554
‐[Satoru] Yeah, sorry.
‐That's cool.
‐See ya.

339
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:11,490
I wonder what the heck
those dudes are up to.

340
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,792
They're acting weird.

341
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,193
‐Wanna follow 'em?
‐Mm‐hmm.

342
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:16,929
‐[Kazu] Come on'!
‐[Osamu] Right behind ya!

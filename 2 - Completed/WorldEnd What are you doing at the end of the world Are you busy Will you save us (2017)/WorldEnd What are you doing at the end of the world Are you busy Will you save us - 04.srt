The power is there, yes,

243
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:10,125
but it does not awaken
in all of the girls.

That must be where the
harbinger dream comes in.

245
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,291
It serves to awaken
the ability in them.

246
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,625
[DOC 4A]
Exactly.

247
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,833
What we do here is tune
their bodies to make sure

00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,833
they grow up healthy and strong,

249
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:25,458
so they can fight one day
as proper dug wielders.

Our enemy is very powerful,
and our dug weapons precious.

Forcing swords onto children

00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,500
when they're still immature

She has no major health
issues to speak of.

beginning to develop cavities.

I'll tell her to
back off the milk.

I wonder if you could help me.

346
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,458
I have an important request I
need to ask of Officer Limeskin.

347
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,500
Do you know if there's
any way I could see him?

348
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,291
Officer Limeskin?

349
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,333
I hate to tell you this, but
that giant lizard isn't here.

350
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,958
He's off fighting somewhere.

351
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,708
[gasps] Can you at least tell
me when he'll be coming back?

352
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,708
No, but I sincerely
wish I could.

353
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,250
They put up a damn magic field,

354
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:21,083
uh, they put up a barrier around
the battlefield for privacy.

355
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,416
We can't communicate.

356
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,166
--[SOLDIER 4D] You're sure?
--[SOLDIER 4E] Yes.

357
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,708
We have to send word.

358
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,041
[SOLDIER 4D]
This is confirmed?

359
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,333
You're sure it's about the
battle with the timere?

360
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,375
[gasps]

361
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,333
[PHYRACORLYBIA gasps]
Wait!

362
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,583
Tell me what happened!

363
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,125
[SOLDIER 4F]
I can't, it's classified.

364
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,375
The information I've been given

365
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,166
can only be circulated
on a regulated channel.

366
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,291
Pay attention,
and try that again.

367
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,708
I'm Officer Willem Kmetsh.

368
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,416
[SOLDIER 4F]
U-Uh! Forgive me, sir.

369
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,125
The dug weapons,
the fairy soldiers.

370
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,166
Both the dug weapons and the
wielders are under my care.

371
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,958
I should know-- I have the right
to know all the data pertaining

372
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,208
to them, and the news about
the battles they take part in.

373
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,458
This is an order.

374
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,500
I want you to tell me
everything you know!

375
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,583
What happened out there?!

376
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,958
Sir.

377
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,000
I just received an official
update from Fleet One.

378
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,500
The information is
regarding the results

379
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,583
of the battle on Island Fifteen.

380
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,333
The defense of the island.

381
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,333
The defense has failed.

382
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,541
[WILLEM gasps]

383
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,625
[SOLDIER 4F]
If you'll excuse me, sir.

384
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,083
What's wrong?
What did he say?

385
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,208
What is going on?
Are you all right, sir?

386
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,291
Hello? Hello?

387
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,708
Hello? Can you hear
what I'm saying, sir?

388
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,791
Oh, please answer me!

389
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,333
[CHTHOLLY]
The other day

390
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,750
you made sweets for the
little ones, remember?

391
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,791
That's what I want.

392
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,125
Can you make me
butter cake, maybe?

393
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,625
Sir, um, if you'd
only speak to me,

394
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,041
perhaps I could
help you somehow.

395
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,791
[SOLDIER 4G]
What?! Really?!

396
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,416
[SOLDIER 4H] We just received
it from General Command HQ.

397
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,833
[SOLDIER 4G]
How many casualties?

398
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,416
What about survivors?

399
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,416
[SOLDIER 4H] Fleet One of the
second Division has returned.

400
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,625
[SOLDIER 4G] We've received
an accurate casualty report!

401
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,875
[SOLDIER 4H]
Send medics, just in case!

402
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,750
[NEPHREN]
I think it would be best

403
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,958
if we send word as
soon as possible.

404
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,000
[ITHEA] Agreed. A certain
someone's heart

405
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,625
is probably jumping out
of his chest right now.

406
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,708
[CHTHOLLY]
But...

407
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,625
[gasps]

408
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,125
[LIMESKIN]
Given the circumstances,

409
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,083
I'll allow you to use the
communication crystals.

410
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,333
[ITHEA]
See?

411
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,208
We've even got the big bad
boss's permission.

412
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,916
[ITHEA]
Huh?

413
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,666
[CHTHOLLY] But when you use
a communication crystal,

414
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,708
the other person
can see us, too.

415
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,916
And I'm covered in mud.

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I haven't even
taken a bath, yet.

417
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,958
Don't worry about that.
You're perfect as you are.

418
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,291
Uh?

419
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,083
Am not. Plus, I'm afraid
it would be kind of rude.

420
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,625
I'm just not mentally ready.

421
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,750
[gasping]

422
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,583
You're okay!

423
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,541
[screams]

424
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,625
[gasps]

425
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,416
[CHTHOLLY gasps]

426
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,041
[CHTHOLLY]  Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

427
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:42,916
What is this?

428
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What's going on?!

429
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,958
Ow, that's hurting.
I can't breathe.

430
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,375
Seriously, I can't breathe!

431
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,125
Did he pop up out of nowhere,
or was that just me?

432
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,958
I'm not sure, my eyes could
not keep up with him.

433
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,208
Perhaps he used
a secret, lost art?

434
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,791
This is why I said
I it would be best

435
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,958
to send word as
soon as possible.

436
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,458
Yes, you did, but admit it.
Like the rest of us,

437
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,916
you never expected to find
Willem this broken up.

438
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,916
No, you're right.

439
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Are you even listening to me?!

440
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,958
Let me go!

441
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,500
I mean, this is bizarre,
especially considering

442
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,708
he usually likes to
play things cool.

443
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,166
Well, he's pretty cute
when he tries to play cool,

444
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,958
but that doesn't really
suit him, either.

445
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,375
Ha! Regardless,
I was expecting him

446
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,458
to be far less
emotional, you know?

447
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:26,750
This is just how Willem is,
hyper focused and hyper intense.

448
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,041
He needs to be looked after,
so he won't get hurt.

449
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,791
Yeah. That makes perfect sense.

450
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,666
I totally get where
you're coming from.

451
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,583
What do you think, Chtholly?

452
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,833
I think you should finish
your stupid conversation

453
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,166
and come help me!

454
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,166
[NEPHREN] Do you? Because
I feel like we should

455
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,875
let him embrace you
until he's satisfied.

456
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,250
No! Don't do it.

457
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,875
My spine will break,
I'll suffocate,

458
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,458
or I'll die of embarrassment
before that happens!

459
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,000
I dunno, if you can yell
like that, I seriously doubt

460
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,125
we need to worry too much
about you suffocating.

461
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,333
Please, don't worry.

462
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,791
We're all right here.

463
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,791
I promise we're not
going anywhere.

464
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,083
[whimpers]

465
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,250
Ren.

466
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,333
[NEPHREN]
Mmhmm.

467
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:13,500
[WILLEM]
Ithea.

468
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,958
Hey, what's up?

469
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,500
And then...

470
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,666
...Chtholly.

471
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,083
[CHTHOLLY]
Seriously, let me go already.

472
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,791
My heart can't take any more!

473
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,291
[SOLDIERS gasp]

474
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,666
[gasps]

475
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,041
Things are gettin' a lil' messy.

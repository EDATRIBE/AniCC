1
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,125
[ELQ]
Solitude in white darkness.

2
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,708
Prayer echoing across
a cramped room.

3
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,166
It gets worse every day.

4
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,583
What am I gonna do?

5
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,791
[footsteps]

6
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,500
[gasps]

7
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,375
Oh, it's just you.

8
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,583
[ITHEA]
That's right!

9
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,458
Ithea Myse Valgulious here!

10
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:52,041
[ITHEA] Now. Mind telling me
exactly who you are?

11
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,750
[CHTHOLLY]
Who am I?

12
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,625
What do you mean?

13
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,541
[ITHEA] I want you to
tell me who you are.

14
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,208
Spell it out for me.

15
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,625
My name is Chtholly
Nota Seniorious.

16
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,291
I didn't need to worry!

17
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,750
You're definitely still
my friend Chtholly.

18
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,416
Worry, about what?

19
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,041
I don't understand.

20
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,625
Why would you worry?

21
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,416
[ITHEA] Look, you need to ignore
all those nonsensical visions,

22
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,041
words, and memories
of that past life.

23
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,916
Otherwise, they're gonna
just eat away at you

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,791
until you start losing
your own memories,

25
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,708
and I really don't want it to
make you forget who you are.

26
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,333
So all these memories,
they're true, they're real?

27
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:11,041
A girl with red hair
keeps telling me that.

28
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,375
[ITHEA]
Do not think about her anymore!

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,208
She doesn't matter.

30
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,541
That girl has nothing
to do with you.

31
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,291
She's a total stranger,
and of no relation.

32
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,833
I want you to think
about who you are,

33
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,333
like as much as you can.

34
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,833
Cling to every memory
you still have now.

35
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,416
Don't let them be swept
away by someone else's.

36
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,791
[CHTHOLLY gasping]

37
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,875
And no generating
venenum anymore.

38
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,791
Jeez, what were you thinking?

39
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,625
But, I had to help her, I--

40
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,333
No "buts" allowed, Chtholly.

41
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,291
Yes, you were very
lucky one time.

42
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,708
You came back!

43
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,291
But, who knows what might
happen next time, though.

44
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,333
Avoid anything that might
trigger a memory of a past life,

45
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,375
and do not generate venenum.

46
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,416
If you wanna stick around
for as long as possible,

47
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,041
you need to follow
these two rules!

48
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,541
I knew it.

49
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,666
My stupid disintegration never
actually stopped, did it?

50
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,583
So, you still decided
to live on, yeah?

51
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,750
Listen. I've got a
story for ya, okay?

52
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:20,500
It's about a girl I once knew.
We were really close.

53
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,791
Just like you, the girl's
past life slowly but surely

54
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:28,291
ate away at her until
her own persona vanished.

55
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,625
Meanwhile, the other girl
who woke up in her place

56
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,333
felt pretty lost, herself.

57
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,458
She'd thought she'd died,
but here she was in a place

58
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,416
she'd never been before,
and in a body that wasn't hers.

59
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,166
[ITHEA] Lucky for her,
she came across a diary

60
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,750
that belonged to the girl who'd
completely disappeared.

61
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,875
She'd written in it every
single day without fail.

62
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,958
Ithea?

63
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,083
She was a bubbly, nosey girl.

64
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,958
I think she focused
on everyone else

65
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,291
so she wouldn't have
to reveal her feelings.

66
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,375
Yep, that's the kind of girl
Ithea Myse Valgulious was.

67
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,166
When it happened,

68
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,875
I thought perhaps killing
myself was for the best.

69
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,166
But then, we'd both be gone.

70
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,916
It would mean nothing.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,916
I realized there was only
one way for me to atone.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,250
I'd stay.

73
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,333
I'd have to take over
being Ithea,

74
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:34,416
and I'd never, ever let anyone
know I wasn't really her.

75
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,958
Funny, somehow I've made
it all the way to today

76
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,125
just by saying that to
myself over and over.

77
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,625
I see.

78
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,541
I'm so sorry.

79
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,708
She had a diary.
Maybe I should start one, too.

80
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,291
Try asking yourself this, first.

81
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,208
Do you want someone
to take over your life?

82
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,416
How does the Chtholly here,

83
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,166
the you right now, how does
she want to live? Hm?

84
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,708
The me here.

85
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,375
The me now.

86
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,416
Uh.

87
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,208
It's getting kinda chilly out.

88
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,666
I'll help. I'm not as
warm as Nephren,

89
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,833
but I'll do my best
to keep you comfy.

90
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,375
You're just gonna
have to make do.

91
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,500
Thank you, but y'know,

92
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,541
you actually seem
pretty warm to me.

93
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,958
It makes me happy to hear that.

94
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,666
Chtholly.

95
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,791
You think you can keep
this from the T.O?

96
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,250
[CHTHOLLY]
Yeah.

97
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:45,208
Besides, knowing would only
make him worry even more.

98
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,791
And I refuse to be the
damsel in distress type.

99
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,583
That's it.

100
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,708
I know what I want to do.

101
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,666
Right now, I just want to savor
the joy of being with him.

102
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,041
I want to revel in being normal.

103
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,416
See, there's that whole "look at
me, I'm in love" thing you do.

104
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,583
Told ya. I knew you

105
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,416
were definitely still
good ol' Chtholly!

106
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,666
Oh, stop.

107
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,708
[ITHEA]
You're the only one.

108
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,666
About Ithea and the diary.

109
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,958
You're the only one I've told.

110
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,083
[CHTHOLLY] Then,
it can be our little secret.

111
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,166
Are you gonna ask me?

112
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,166
Like, don't you wanna
know my real name?

113
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,208
Or find out what kind
of person I was before?

114
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,375
You're Ithea, too, though.

115
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,041
A bubbly, nosey girl.
One who focuses on

116
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,916
everyone else so she doesn't
have to reveal her feelings.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,416
She's a fellow fairy,
and one of my best friends.

118
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,750
That's all that really matters.

119
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,958
It is. Thank you.

120
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,708
That's such a relief.

121
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,166
Let's go!

Oh, was that just you, Chtholly?

127
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,500
I'm sorry.
Was I being too loud?

is still changing.

Yeah. I'm really
starting to like it.

00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,125
Yes, I can tell.
I mean, you're owning it!

131
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,666
Thank you!

[GIRLS gasping]

135
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,875
[CHTHOLLY]
But even when I'm sad,

136
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,583
even when I feel like
I'm being torn apart,

137
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,291
even the tears that are
always ready to flow,

138
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,416
they all prove I'm still here.

139
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,666
All the worry, the frustration,
the sorrow, and the joy.

140
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,041
They're all different parts

141
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,166
of what make up the person
standing right here,

142
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,541
the person alive right now.

143
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:14,708
The girl who is, without
a doubt, me... Chtholly.

Yes, at least for now.

You're knitting?

It's gotten pretty cold lately.

148
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,708
The little ones don't have
anything warm enough to wear,

149
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,375
so I thought I'd help.

150
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,541
That's nice.

151
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,625
So, whatcha say?

00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,708
Some people think this
color suits me, do you?

153
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,375
Okay, what's the matter?

154
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,291
You don't have to worry.

155
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,750
All right, then. If you say so.

156
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,208

How's Collon's cold?

160
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,708
Is she gonna be okay?

161
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,833
[NYGGLATHO] Still not over
the hump yet, I'd say.

162
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,750
I'm gonna pick her up
some medicine later.

163
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,041

Sounds good.

164

You're improving so much!

Chtholly. When you
get a chance,

167
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,416
will you put this under
Collon's pillow for me?

168
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,666
It's an ancient talisman

169
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,041
to prevent nightmares
when you have a cold.

I'm worried about her.

Her cold has lasted so long.

Oh, right. That's fine.

Uh.

176
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:17,166
How neat! I didn't know you
had something like this.

177
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,333
Not me. Seniorious provided it.

178
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,500
[NYGGLATHO]
Did you say Seniorious?

179
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,833
[WILLEM] Yeah, I told you that
dug weapons were comprised

180
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,375
of several different
talismans, didn't I?

181
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,625
Uh...

182
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,958
[WILLEM]
The other ones prevent cuts

183
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,000
when the blade isn't
imbued with magic,

184
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,833
or they raise an alarm when
the wielder uses an alias.

185
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,458
They're kinda useless
at the moment,

186
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,583
so I figured we might--

187
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,958
You put that talisman
back right now!

188
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,208
What has gotten into you?!

189
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,708
Do I have to remind you
that dug weapons aren't

190
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,000
every day little charms that
we can hand out willy-nilly

191
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,666
for whatever we want
whenever we want it.

192
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,000
They're ultimate weapons,

193
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,750
ones that should be prioritized
better than this!

194
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,291
[WILLEM laughs] You're being
overdramatic, and you know it.

195
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,958
Unless you think
Collon's not a priority,

196
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,208
and that she doesn't need
a good night's sleep.

197
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,333
[sighs]

198
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,541
[NYGGLATHO]
What am I gonna do with you?

199
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:06,583
Oh, fine. Of course, I'm
worried about her, too.

200
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,375
Just promise me
you'll put it back

201
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,416
before you go to the surface.

202
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,083
I promise.

203
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,791
Speaking of the surface, do you
think they're okay down there?

204
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,500
What were their names again?
Nopht and Rhantolk, right?

205
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,458
[NYGGLATHO] Yes, and there's
currently no need

206
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,666
to be troubled.
For what it's worth,

207
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,791
the military is rushing to
finish the ship's remodeling.

208
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,750
Well, that's reassuring to hear.

209
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,291
I'm concerned about that
artifact they recovered, too.

210
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,666
[NYGGLATHO]
Oh, that's right.

211
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,666
Lapidemsibilus.

212
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,666
You're worried about it
'cause you worry about me

213
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,000
which you do too much.

214
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,333
He's an overprotective
daddy, this one.

215
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,500
[WILLEM]
Uh. Shut up.

216
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,750
[NYGGLATHO]
What? It's better

217
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,708
than being an
overprotective sugar daddy!

218
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,708
[WILLEM]
Oh, come on. Not you, too.

219
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,166
You both should shut up.
Neither of you are making sense.

220
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,583
[CHTHOLLY]
Uh... Here we go.

221
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,583
[WILLEM]
Huh...

222
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,041
[CHTHOLLY]
What?

223
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,500
[WILLEM] You've been doing
more stuff like that lately.

224
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,583
It gives you that traditional,
girly girl charm.

225
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,750
[CHTHOLLY gasps] I have
to count the stitches,

226
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,916
so I'd appreciate it if
you didn't distract me!

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,708
[WILLEM] What? I was just
trying to compliment you.

228
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,750
[CHTHOLLY]
That was a compliment?!

229
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,125
[yawns] You're still up, Rhan?

230
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,625
--Wow.
--Yes.

231
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,000
I wonder how long this
rescue squad is gonna take,

232
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,708
it's been like forever.

233
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,250
I just got the word.

234
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,958
It's gonna take them
even longer to get ready.

235
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,750
[NOPHT] You're trying
to read that again?

236
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:39,666
I am.

237
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,583
[NOPHT]
Figure anything out?

238
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,208
I haven't.

239
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,166
But I believe I can come up with
an alternative interpretation

240
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,708
for this passage.
Humans by the surface.

241
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,208
No...

242
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,416
By the humans, the surface...

243
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,958
The surface's...? [gasps]

244
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,333
Nopht, will you kindly and
immediately get off me.

245
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,375
[knocking]

246
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,708
[WILLEM]
It's open.

247
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,416
[door creaks]

248
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,291
[door slams]

249
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,708
Staying up late again?

250
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,833
[WILLEM]
I guess, kinda.

251
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,083
[CHTHOLLY]
Um, so uh.

252
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,166
You know all those
things that you do?

253
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,458
[WILLEM]
Hm?

254
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,958
All those things that you do.

255
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,250
Can you teach me how
to do them, too?

256
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:34,541
Like how to tune the swords, and
that weird thing you did for me.

257
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,916
Y'know, the thing you
did with your hands.

258
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,541
Why are you looking
at me like that?!

259
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,958
[WILLEM sighs]
What's gotten into you?

260
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,250
Lately, you haven't
given me much attention,

261
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,375
probably because you
didn't have a reason to.

262
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,541
I thought you'd make time
for me if I was learning,

263
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,916
and any time spent
together works for me.

264
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,625
[WILLEM]
You can't be serious.

265
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,166
Although I can't fight,

266
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,166
I'm still forcing you to take
me to the surface with you,

267
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,083
so I would like to be useful.

268
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,500
None of those skills
are something

269
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,250
you can master overnight.

270
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,416
You would have to put in a lot
of time and effort first.

271
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,958
[CHTHOLLY]
Mm.

272
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,625
Don't get too worked up.

273
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,958
I know how you feel,

274
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,541
but I'm still not going to
make you push yourself.

275
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,875
Don't be silly.
I wouldn't push myself.

276
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,750
[WILLEM]
And don't you play dumb.

277
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,875
You've been losing your
memories, haven't you?

278
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,750
[gasps] I didn't realize
that you knew.

279
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,500
[WILLEM]
I could tell from watching you.

280
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,458
So you were watching me.

281
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,166
But, if we have Lapidemsibilus,

282
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,666
we won't have to
worry about that.

283
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,083
[CHTHOLLY]
Is that map of the surface?

284
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,750
[WILLEM] Yep, it's the
area near the ruins,

285
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,166
where the survey
team was attacked.

286
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,833
[CHTHOLLY] Isn't this
where the rescue squad

287
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,208
is supposed to land?

288
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,291
That's a bit close to camp,
don't you think?

289
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,750
Oh, but I suppose that
would make it easier

290
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,041
to transfer the haul.

291
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,500
[WILLEM] Well, aren't you
quick on the uptake?

292
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,125
I am your secretary, after all!

293
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,041
Where we're going is
your home, isn't it?

294
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,166
Five hundred years ago.

295
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,666
[CHTHOLLY]
Would you want to go back?

296
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,291
This island has become
my home now.

297
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,750
Our home.

298
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,291
It is. Yes.

299
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,708
Hey. What was your city like?

300
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,625
Did it have really amazing food?

301
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,125
Were you in love there?

302
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,916
[WILLEM] What's all this,
why the sudden interrogation?

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,416
It's my understanding that
one needs detailed intel

304
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,791
on their destination beforehand.

305
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:25,875
But wait!

306
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,291
I'm gonna go get
some more tea, first.

307
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,791
Be right back.

308
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,750
Give me a break,
you're just curious.

309
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,875
This is so good.

310
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,000
[CHTHOLLY] Rather than
worry and be stagnant,

311
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,625
I'll keep moving forward,
one step at a time.

312
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,041
My footsteps may fade behind me,

313
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,375
and the path ahead may
be dark as well.

314
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:52,000
But, I won't regret the past,

315
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,500
or be pessimistic
about the future.

316
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,125
[CHTHOLLY] I will simply live
here in the moment.

317
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,458
Because no matter
how I fight it,

318
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,166
the clock keeps
ticking down on me.

319
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,833
[CHTHOLLY]
11... 12... 13... 14...

320
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,250
Perfect! [laughs]

321
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,250
[ALMITA]
Auntie Nee!

322
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,083
[NYGGLATHO laughs]

323
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,833
[CHTHOLLY] And time,
it keeps on passing by.

324
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,000
[GIRLS laughing]

325
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,333
[CHTHOLLY]
I'm glad I finished in time.

326
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,666
Uh, this is for Tiat.

327
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,083
[TIAT]
Me? Really?

328
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,166
Thank you so much!
I'll love it forever!

329
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,333
[ALMITA gasping]

330
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,750
[CHTHOLLY]
This one is for... Lakhesh!

331
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,458
Wow, um, thank you
very much, Chtholly!

332
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,750
[COLLON]
What about Collon?

333
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,333
Hey, what about me,
where's mine?

334
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,500
[PANNIBAL]
Collon needs to wait her turn.

335
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,083
[CHTHOLLY]
Here you go, sweetie.

336
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,083
[gasping] Oh, it's so warm!

337
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,375
[ITHEA]
The rest of you better hurry

338
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,083
and get your butts
over here, too.

339
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,041
Chtholly's giving out presents!

340
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,333
[GIRLS cheer]

341
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,916
All right, so what's
the deal with this party?

342
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,875
It's a snowfall fest.

343
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,250
It's for snowy nights,
when you can't go out.

344
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,833
Instead, you wine
and dine all night long.

345
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,041
[WILLEM]
Huh.

346
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,333
[NYGGLATHO]
It's a popular event these days,

347
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,541
but originally, it was one
of our troll festivals.

348
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:23,625
[WILLEM] Uh... I think
I'll pass on the details.

349
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,583
But, let's say
it's also a send-off

350
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,833
for those of you headed
to the surface.

351
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,375
It's really not that
big a deal, is it?

352
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,791
Um, so we have presents
for the older fairies, too.

353
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,250
Although, I guess they
aren't exactly from us.

354
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,208
[NYGGLATHO gasping]
Gosh, you look so lovely,

355
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,833
I could eat you up right now!

356
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,833
Let go! You're squeezing
me too tight!

357
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,250
I can't breathe, and you're
gonna wrinkle my dress!

358
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,833
[ITHEA] Mm! I'm telling ya, that
there is one high-class lady.

359
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,791
I tip my hat to Lady
Phyra's good taste.

360
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,833
Why would she send us all this?

361
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,666
It's for the snowfall
fest, apparently.

362
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,041
[WILLEM]
Oh, um.

363
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,833
"Thank you all for your help
when you were here last.

364
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,291
I know this isn't much,

365
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,583
but I wanted to send some
gifts for the snowfall fest.

366
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:09,125
I hope you all come to visit me
in Corna di Luce again soon!"

367
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,250
What is it, Ren?

368
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,666
There is something for you.

369
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,916
[ITHEA muffled laughter]

370
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,916
Cheer up.

371
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,375
I can't believe that little--

372
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,208
[GIRLS gasping]

373
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,041
[TIAT]
Gorgeous!

374
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,583
[WILLEM gasps]

375
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,291
Look at that.

376
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,541
Get over there.

377
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,333
If there's ever been a
time to compliment her,

378
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,666
this is that time.

379
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,458
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
I know what to say.

380
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,041
[ITHEA]
Say everything you want.

381
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,708
Ask everything you need.

382
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,583
Putting it off can be
a bad idea,

383
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,791
and you know that
better than anyone.

384
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,083
[GIRLS chattering]

385
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,041
[footsteps]

386
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,208
[WILLEM]
Hey, Chtholly.

387
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,416
Uh?

388
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,083
You look absolutely beautiful.

389
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,666
[GIRLS chattering]

390
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,875
I...

391
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,208
I know!

392
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,708
[CHTHOLLY]
This should be enough clothes.

393
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,375
What about books, though?

394
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,041
[knocking]

395
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,375
[NEPHREN] Chtholly,
it's almost time to leave.

396
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,000
[CHTHOLLY]
Oh, okay.

397
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,625
[CHTHOLLY]
Who am I, really?

398
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:32,708
[GIRLS crying]

399
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,208
See you later.

400
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,708
We're off, girls.

401
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,208
[CHTHOLLY]
I can't stop it.

402
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,375
My memories are slowly fading.

403
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,958
The person I am
is crumbling away.

404
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,875
You girls better be good
for Nygglatho, okay?

405
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,416
[NYGGLATHO]
Be safe.

406
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,875
We'll prepare a "welcome back"
party for you while we wait.

407
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,041
[ITHEA grunts]

408
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,916
[ITHEA]
Don't push yourself.

409
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,541
It's a promise, right?

410
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,291
[CHTHOLLY]
It's a promise.

411
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,666
[GIRLS cry]

412
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,125
[CHTHOLLY]
I'm...

413
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,208
I'm so sorry.

414
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,041
[CHTHOLLY]
It's sad.

415
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,666
I've forgotten more than half
of what I knew about them.

416
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,458
I can relearn the names I can't
remember anymore, however,

417
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,583
I know the memories I've
lost will never come back.

418
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,916
[CHTHOLLY]
As everything I am falls apart,

419
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,791
can I even be called
Chtholly at this point?

420
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,625
It's heartbreaking.

421
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,041
I'm hurt and just so sad.

422
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,958
[CHTHOLLY] But right now, I want
to hold all these feelings

423
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,083
as close to my heart as I can.

424
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:44,916
Because the moment
they disappear, too...

425
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,666
...that's the moment there
will be nothing left of me.

426
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
[NOPHT laughs]
Ren!

427
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,583
[NOPHT]
Heh! I never expected you

428
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,541
to be a part of
the rescue squad!

429
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:34,041
I swear, you're just as
teeny-tiny as ever!

430
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,166
[NOPHT]
Hey, since you're here,

431
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,708
that must mean the
massive timere

432
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,583
you guys were fighting ended
up being taken out, huh?

433
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,250
Which then means Chtholly
opened the Fairy Gate.

434
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,083
Um.

435
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,750
I guess that's, uh...

436
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:50,083
[NOPHT] You know, Chtholly and
I never got along that well.

437
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,625
But now.

438
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,791
I feel like I should have tried
harder--talked to her more.

439
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:57,791
[CHTHOLLY]
Um...

440
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,083
[NOPHT]
Don't "um" me.

441
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,083
I need to grieve for Chtholly.

442
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,750
So, long time no see, Nopht.

443
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:03,708
[NOPHT]
You!

444
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,541
Eh?

445
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,291
[NOPHT whimpers]

446
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,875
--It's a ghost!
--Hey, wait up!

447
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:11,000
You don't understand,
I'm still alive!

448
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,958
[NOPHT, CHTHOLLY chattering]

449
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,125
Well, that's a
good way to start.

450
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,791
[CHTHOLLY]
Next episode: my happiness.

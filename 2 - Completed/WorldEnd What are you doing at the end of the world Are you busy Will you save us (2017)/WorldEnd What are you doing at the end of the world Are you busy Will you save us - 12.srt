Oh, no, I'm sorry.

354
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,750
I didn't mean to
frighten you again.

355
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,458
Please forgive me!

356
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:30,625
[BABY cries]

357
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,333
[FAIRY 12A]
Listen to that!

358
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,041
Poor thing hasn't
let go of her feelings

359
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,708
from her past life yet.

360
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,541
She must have a
really pure heart.

361
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,083
[FAIRY 12B] By that, do you
mean simple and naïve?

362
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,416
[FAIRY 12A]
That is one way to look at it.

363
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,958
Good evening, sweetheart.

364
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,375
It's so nice to meet you.

365
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,125
[laughs] So stubborn.

366
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:51,291
Ugh. Here, let me try something.

367
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,000
There we go.

368
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:57,333
[muffled]

369
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,083
See? She got tired
and is now silent.

370
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,250
[FAIRY 12A]
That's enough of that...

371
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:09,875
[FAIRY 12A sighs]
Welcome, little one.

372
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,958
Welcome to this fragile,
dying world

373
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:15,041
with no redeeming
qualities whatsoever.

374
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,250
We're happy to have you.

375
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,500
[gasps]

it sent the whole

We had no choice, y'know?
The island had to be abandoned.

The loss was all
my fault, though.

I should've just blown myself up
and neutralized the enemy.

61
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,750
But instead, I decided
to be selfish.

The tactical projections failed
to account for the other beast.

If you'd self-destructed
to take it out,

to try and eliminate

00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,958
That would have yielded
a far worse outcome

had a chance to defeat them.

to blame yourself.

It's because of his

ask you, Willem.

No, it's not like that at all.

178
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,875
It doesn't matter whom
I'm dealing with.

179
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,125
I just don't want to
accept anything,

180
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,166
you know, if I can't accept it.

181
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,625
[NEPHREN]
Huh?

182
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,083
Wanna try that again?

183
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,541
Sorry, it sounded
better in my head.

184
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,125
And what's goin' on over
here with you smiling,

185
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,375
what's that about, huh?

186
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,375
Oh, nothing.

187
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,333
I will never understand you two.

188
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,416
I swear!

189
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,541
Uh.

190
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,166
[sniffing]

191
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,541
Something smells really good!

192
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,208
Look, they're wrapping meat
in leaves over there,

193
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,708
and it looks yummy!

194
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,541
[NEPHREN]
It's wrapped ram.

195
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,791
I am pretty hungry,
now that I think about it.

196
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,916
We can grab lunch here,
if everyone wants to.

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,833
[PHYRACORLYBIA] I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

198
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,041
They're obviously using
far too much spice,

199
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,125
and they do not have their
permit clearly on display,

200
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,750
as is the legal requirement.

201
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,458
I have little doubt they'll feed
you meat that is barely edible.

202
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,750
If you ask me,
it's not worth the risk.

203
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,708
What's worse, their prices
are higher than normal!

204
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,916
That's worse?

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,333
Come this way.

206
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,916
I'll show you genuine
Corna di Luce wrapped ram

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,333
that won't make you ill.

208
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,916
That's weird. Did she morph
into someone else?

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,208
Maybe.

210
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,416
[TIAT]
So good!

211
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,333
[ITHEA]
I can't stop wolfing it down!

212
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,833
Let me see, if I had to guess,

213
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,291
I'd say they used less spice
and incorporated some herbs

214
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,583
to give this wrap a
little more balance.

215
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,958
Either way, the flavor makes it
easy to eat a whole bunch of it.

216
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,416
I know, it's so, good!

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,916
[WILLEM]
What's wrong?

218
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You haven't taken a single bite.

219
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,208
[gasps] Just thinking.

220
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,541
Well, don't force yourself.

221
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,458
I'm sure the girls
will take any leftovers.

222
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,958
[BOTH]
We sure will!

223
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,708
You may not know this, but
wrapped ram is a tradition here.

224
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,000
And this restaurant makes the
best wraps in the entire city!

225
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,541
Of course, all the locals
know about this place.

226
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,833
Even a five-year-old
would tell you that.

227
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,708
Wow, the local five-year-olds
are intense.

228
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,416
To top it off, where we
are is so legendary,

229
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,750
countless movies have been
filmed right here!

230
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,041
Oh! Like the scene in
<i>Clockwork Love and Dreams,</i>

231
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,875
where the golem
accidentally gets drunk!

232
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,583
That's right!

233
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,625
You know, I think I've also seen
it before in <i>Let Me Trick You,</i>

234
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,333
and <i>The Return of Detective</i>
<i>Curio</i> , and <i>Howl, Lazioni</i> !

235
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,958
My, how delightful.
I am very impressed!

236
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,750
As for us, our
ten-year-old's intense.

237
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,750
My beautiful Corna di Luce.

238
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,041
It's been the setting
for many, many stories.

239
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,500
No surprise, though.

240
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,208
The rich cuisine, featuring
classics like wrapped ram,

241
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,208
and the artistry, history
and luminaries are

242
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,083
all well known to those
across Règles Aile now.

243
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,625
I'm just so proud of it!

244
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,583
Wow, I can tell you
really love this city,

245
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,000
like a whole lot, don't you?

246
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,500
Yes. Corna di Luce
is my home, after all.

247
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,833
I suppose it's my
favorite city ever!

248
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,416
Ha, ha! I like that
because I love it, too!

249
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,750
[WILLEM laughs]
Favorite ever, huh.

250
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,666
I'm impressed you can say
that with a straight face.

251
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,458
And what does that mean?

252
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,083
Nothing. I like your
style, that's all.

253
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,833
I just wasn't sure we'd ever
get you to lighten up.

254
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,083
[PHYRACORLYBIA]
Don't mock me.

255
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,083
I hate it when people
always speak casually.

256
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,541
I gathered as much. [laughs]

257
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,208
Whaddaya think. Somethin'
weird in her past, right?

258
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,583
Maybe?

259
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,000
[PHYRACORLYBIA]
This is Perjurer's Grave.

260
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,625
A legendary con man from
around 200 years ago

261
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,208
rests in this location.

262
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,166
I've seen this in movies, too!

263
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,333
Of course you have.

264
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,000
The stone says,
"Here lies an honest man."

265
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,125
I know this is gonna
be a bit off topic,

266
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,333
but how did we end up
on a sightseeing tour?

267
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,750
Is there a problem?

268
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,375
We have time until the airship's
ready to take us home.

269
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,166
[ITHEA] It's just kinda weird
to take weapons sightseeing.

270
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,833
I mean, talk about
special treatment!

271
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,375
If you ask me, we better thank
the lizard and the lady.

272
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,916
[trumpet, accordion play]

273
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,500
[ELQ]
Locked red grimoire.

274
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,500

Sweet cry of death.

[CHTHOLLY gasps]

276
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,875
[ELQ] Headless clown,
wandering in twilight.

277
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,208
He laughs, laughs, laughs,
laughs, laughs, laughs.

[WILLEM]
Chtholly?

281
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,500
[CHTHOLLY]
Wh-What is it?

282
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,583
Are you sure you're
feeling all right?

283
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,458
You've been so quiet today, it's
like having a statue among us.

284
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,041
As far as quiet goes,
statues are the quietest.

285
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,666
If you're too tired, please
tell me you're too tired.

286
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,625
I don't want to push you
and make it worse.

287
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,958
Right.

288
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,916
It isn't like that, though.

289
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,166
Didn't mean to worry you.

290
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,416
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,666
If the venenum your body
generated during combat

292
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,833
is still lingering
somewhere inside you,

293
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,416
do want me to do the deal again?

294
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,000
No, thanks!

295
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,208
And will you please stop doing
that, you're freaking me out!

296
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,375
What's the deal?

297
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,541
None of your business,
so back off!

298
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,041
Next up, we have the
Lovers' Staircase.

299
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,666
This is where a legendary couple

300
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,541
whose love transcended
social status met.

301
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,833
[TIAT] I've seen this
in so many movies!

302
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,333
Yes, of course she has.

303
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,875
The two accidentally bumped
into each other at the top.

304
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,416
They rolled down
the stairs together,

305
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,083
marking the start of
their romance, but now...

306
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,750
[ITHEA]
There's a "no rolling" rule?

307

[BOTH gasp]

308
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You mean we can't
roll down the stairs?!

00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,750
[PHYRACORLYBIA laughs]

310
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,208
[gasps] Hey.

311
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,958
All right, it's time
to set the bait.

312
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,958
[PHYRACORLYBIA]
Well, what do you think?

313
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you like the city so far?

314
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,583
Yes, I'm enjoying my time here.

315
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,041
I already loved it, but now
I like love, love, love it!

316
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,708
[WILLEM]
That's wonderful.

317
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,625
Hey, is there a fun
spot we can head to

318
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,625
that's a bit more
isolated than this?

319
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,333
I know just the place.

320
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,791
Welcome to the Well of Wishes.

321
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,625
[TIAT] Oh! I've never
ever seen this before!

322
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,041
[ITHEA]
The Well of Wishes?

323
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,083
Hold on, is this one of
those throw your coin in,

324
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,291
and get your wish granted
kind of places?

325
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,083
That sounds like it came
straight out of a fairy tale!

326
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,833
[THUG 5A] Forgive us for
interrupting your fun,

327
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,500
but your tour has
come to an end.

00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,500
[THUG 5A chuckles]

329
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,000
[NEPHREN]
We're surrounded.

330
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,083
What are you doing?
Who are you people?

331
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,583
Oh, come on, you can't
tell me you don't know

332
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,875

when they appear!

So it is you!

336
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,500
Really...?

337
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,458
Apparently.

338
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,250
We have come here
for all that is right

00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,500
and for the greater good,
we must assassinate the mayor,

assassinate the mayor
for all that is right

00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,791
and for the greater good!

342
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,000
As an insurance policy,
we will take you into custody,

He talks weird.

345
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,041
All that effort for
such an awful show.

[WILLEM] First of all, I've
known you've been following us.

370
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,541
So we kept to
rather public places.

371
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,958
When we moved to a desolate one,

372
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,583
you saw your chance,
but you never had one.

Please don't tell me.

Did you use me to lure them in?

[WILLEM] Yes. You were
what's called bait.

To be clear,
I could not care less

about either your
politics or justice.

I'm only taking your side
for personal reasons.

You've been extremely
kind to us,

our precious T.O.

to our spouses.

wanted to protect her home
with such, uh... passion.

Yes.

426

But she hates me, and it
seems she hates me a lot.

not ask me for any help again.

It's for the best, though.

be able to stay that way.

Excuse me?

The finger guns were nothing
more than camouflage.

you did it by throwing coins.

It's not a good eye.

better than anyone else in

Did you forget?

I could see it because
you taught me to fight

I paid attention.

such a good student

For years, I've waited
for death to release me.

While I've waited, all I wanted
was to go back home,

to go back to the people
that waited for me.

me a slice of salvation,

better come home, okay?

It's a promise.

[WILLEM] I never welcomed
them back from battle.

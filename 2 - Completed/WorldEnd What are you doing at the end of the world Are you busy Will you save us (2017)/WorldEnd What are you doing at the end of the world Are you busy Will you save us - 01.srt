00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,250
[NARRATOR]
We swore never to part.

2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,458
[NARRATOR]
With our vow came euphoria.

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:27,125
[NARRATOR]
My love for him was undeniable.

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,083
[NARRATOR]
There was no greater happiness.

5
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,875
[NARRATOR]
Yet, he offered more...

6
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,541
[NARRATOR]
...and I delighted in it.

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,333
[NARRATOR] The gifts of love
and bliss he presented to me

8
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:51,250
were unlike anything
I'd ever known.

9
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,833
My life became his,
and his mine.

10
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:58,041
He blessed me with his world.

11
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,083
He rewarded me with assurance.

12
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:05,291
There is no joy ever known
that can compare with my own.

Careful! You trying
to hurt someone?

That wasn't me,

Are your organs intact?

Don't stare, it's rude.

38
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,250
Now, what's this?

39
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,708
Wonder why someone without any
fur would be on this island.

40
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,166
Oh no, I lost my hat!

Get out of here, you freak.

Yeah, get out.

I'm leaving, okay. Let go.

00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,125
[WILLEM]
Seriously, hold on.

49
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,083
[WILLEM] I pulled this out
of that little cat's mouth.

50
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,500
Yours, right?

51
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,625
Yes, thanks.

52
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,083
Are you all right?

53
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,208
I'm good. I gather
you must be new here?

54
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,291
[CHTHOLLY]
Yes.

55
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,791

00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,458
That'll do the trick.

64
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,791
Thank you. So, are you--

65
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,083
This island has no good
food or local specialties.

66
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,833
But you-- [screams]

67
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,250
You may have noticed it's not
very welcoming to those of us

68
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,083
who lack fangs or horns.

69
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,958
Not great for tourism.

70
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,958
Yes, I already know that.

71
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,250
[WILLEM]
Follow me.

72
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,625
I'm sure you've had it
with this place by now.

73
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,583
I'll show you to the port so
you can get off this island.

74
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,208
No, wait!

75
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,541
I appreciate your help.

76
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,791
And I'm...

77
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,500
I'm sorry for all the
trouble I've caused you.

78
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,916
It's just, I--

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, I realize I have no right
to ask anything of you,

80
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,416
but, um, would you...

81
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,708
[WILLEM] All right,
where do you want to go?

82
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,083
[gasps]

83
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,750
[WILLEM] Is this the view
you were hoping for?

84
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,208
[CHTHOLLY] I've seen
sky islands from higher up

85
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,208
and farther out before,
but gazing down on one

86
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,958
from the heart of the city
like this is brand new.

87
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,208
I've always wanted to do it,

88
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,916
just never really
had the chance.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,166
That so?

90
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,291
But now, I've officially
made my wish a reality,

91
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,083
and I got to make some
great memories, too.

92
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,000
Thank you again for today.

93
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,125
So many wonderful experiences,

94
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,500
and it's all thanks to you.

95
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,833
I think you're giving
me too much credit.

96
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,125
What about them? I'm guessing
they're here for you?

97
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,625
Today's been kinda like a
fairytale, but time's up.

98
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,875
Mind if I make one last request,
fairy godfather?

99
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,250
It's a small one.

100
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,708
I'd appreciate it if you'd
forget you ever met me.

101
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:49,958
Forget I ever met you...?

102
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,875
[CHTHOLLY laughs]
Farewell!

103
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,791
Curious, but I suppose it's
none of my business anyway.

104
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,916
[WILLEM]
Long time no see, Grick.

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,458
How's Anara doing?

106
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,875
[GRICK] He screwed up
big time last month.

107
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,541
Wound up becoming Third food.

108
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm so sorry to hear that.

109
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,583
Well, don't be. That's
the life of a salvager.

110
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,458
From the moment we
choose to treasure hunt

111
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,083
on the surface,
we're prepared to die.

112
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,125
That's true.

113
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,583
No need to be sad!
Now, on to happy news.

114
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,041
I think I might be able
to land you work!

115
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,916
Yeah, it's for the military.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,583
Come on, kid!

117
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,500
You could at least pretend
to be excited about this.

118
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,333
They're not lookin' for
special skills or experience.

119
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,750
The only quality they require
is someone who's trustworthy.

120
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,916
[WILLEM]
Hm...

121
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,125
[WILLEM]
No.

122
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,708
Sorry, but I gotta pass.

123
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,375
You'll have to ask
a different loser.

124
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,416
Look, they're also
insisting on a disfeatured,

125
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,666
with no horns or fur.
You're perfect for this.

126
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,375
In fact, you're the only one
they could hire, and you.

127
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,583
[WILLEM] I said no.

128
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,583
I appreciate how you try
to look out for me,

129
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,291
but I choose to live here
of my own free will.

130
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,166
[GRICK]
I understand.

131
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,166
You wanna keep living
like an outcast.

132
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,333
Dead man walking
and all that, right?

133
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,666
Why try to find something
that makes you happy when

134
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,625
you've already decided
not to be?

135
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,208
I get where you're comin'
from, kid, believe me.

136
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,791
But I can't help it.

137
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,958
I want you to be able to live a
normal life up in these skies.

138
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,333
I want you to accept
what I know.

139
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,875
The dead won't come back.

140
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,458
But you're not dead,
you've still got a life to live!

141
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,875
Look, you can make a ton of
cash on this thing, okay?

142
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,125
Why not at least get all
that debt off your back?

143
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,833
Give yourself a chance
to find the right path.

144
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,041
What's going on with this
coffee, it tastes salty.

145
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,708
[sighs]

146
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,666
Oh, damn it all. Ok, Fine!

147
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,833
So you'll take the job, then?

148
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,833
Yes. You positive
they'll want me?

149
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,750
Did you tell the military
I can't even fight,

150
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,291
let alone kill someone?

151
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't worry about that.

152
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,250
You're just gonna be the
caretaker of a warehouse

153
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,458
that holds some
special weaponry.

154
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,541
[WILLEM]
Already sounds like a bad idea.

155
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,583
Wonderful! I'll tell
them you're coming!

156
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,750
Get 'em to fill you
in once you're there.

157
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:13,583
Ah. Whoa, you're not kidding,
this coffee is salty.

158
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,041
[WILLEM] Would've been nice
to know that the warehouse

159
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,000
was on a different island.

160
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:32,791
It's Cold.

161

[wolves howling]

162
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,083
[WILLEM]
Oh, no.

163
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,000
Wolves are the
last thing I need.

164
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,291
It's been a long time since
I felt being a disfeatured

165
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,375
may not be in my best interest.

166
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,750
And now the bridge
is falling apart.

167
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,666
This is great...

168
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,083
Stuck in the middle of nowhere!

177
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,500
[PANNIBAL grunts]

178
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,041
Pannibal, what do you
think you're doing

179
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,375
running off on your
own like that?

180
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,666
I've taken down a
suspicious individual.

181
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,250
[CHTHOLLY] Right, like there's
even anyone else here.

182
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,416
[gasps]

183
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,250
[WILLEM groaning]

184
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,125
Hey, it's you.

185
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,208
[gasps] I, what, wait,
what are you doing here?

186
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,916
[WILLEM]
Me? Whoa, so many questions.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,208
[sneezes]

188
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,958
First things first. Help me.

189
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,666
[WILLEM]
Something's wrong.

190
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,208
This is nothing like
what Grick said.

191
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,041
[knocking]

192
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,416
Just a minute.

193
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,791
[NYGGLATHO]
Ahh! Ha, ha, ha!

194
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,750
It's been forever, Willem!

195
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,666
Welcome to the secret
weapons warehouse!

196
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,916
Oh, my. Have you
grown a bit taller?

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,791
Why are you here
of all places...

198
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:17,708
...Nygglatho?

199
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,333
Why, you ask.

200
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:23,125
Why wouldn't I be here, silly?
This is my job, where I work!

201
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,833
[WILLEM]
Damn it. Grick set me up!

202
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,791
[NYGGLATHO] I take it you two
are still good friends?

203
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,166
[WILLEM] Were good friends
is more like it.

204
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,166
[NYGGLATHO] Try to keep it
down while we're inside.

205
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,916
Everyone's in bed
this time of night.

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,291
[WILLEM]
"Everyone"?

207
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,208
[NYGGLATHO] Mm-hm! This
warehouse is run jointly by

208
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,125
the Guardian Wings Military and
the Orlandry Merchant Guild.

209
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,291
So, at least on paper,

210
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,208
it requires caretakers
from both parties.

211
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,125
I represent the Orlandry.

212
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,208
You are the military caretaker.

213
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,500
Yes, that much I know.

214
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,583
Oh, you look so yummy
in your uniform!

215
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,125
I feel like I'm choking...

216
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,750
Now, there's really no need
to rain on my parade, is there?

217
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,041
Everyone knows good toppings

218
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,791
only accentuate the
flavor of a dish,

219
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,708
which means to me you're,
at the very least,

220
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,375
twice as appetizing as I
believe I've ever seen you be.

221
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,291
So you're saying my life
is in twice as much danger.

222
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,041
Oh no, oh, ye of little faith.

223
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,500
Have you already forgotten?

224
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,416
While, yes, I may be a
troll and while, yes,

225
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
you may be an extremely
rare feast in my eyes,

226
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,041
I have no plan to dig in.

227
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:17,916
Not yet.

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,291
[WILLEM]
Wow. Thanks.

229
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,333
[door slams]

230
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,583
[NYGGLATHO]
Can you imagine the shame?

231
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,791
You're the last of
your kind, after all.

232
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,791
I know better than to waste you
on a passing burst of craving,

233
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,458
no matter how strong.

234
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,541
Of course, if you were to give
me permission to eat you,

235
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,875
I would certainly consider it.

236
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,541
[NYGGLATHO]
Do I have your permission?

237
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,791
Hell, no.

238
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,666
No? Oh, won't you please
consider it some more.

239
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,166
I'd be fine with a
non-dominant arm.

240
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,000
Even a finger would do for now.

241
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,416
Stop it. Can we get down
to business, please?

242
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,875
So, what exactly am
I supposed to do?

243
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,000
Not a damn thing.

244
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,333
Huh?

245
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,000
Wait, you're not planning
to stay on this island,

246
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,500
as well, are you?

247
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,375
Well, obviously. How else will
I do my job as caretaker?

248
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm legitimate military, now,
so I'm sticking around.

249
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,958
I only ask because the previous
two caretakers didn't bother

250
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,416
showing up after the first day.

251
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,458
Really?

252
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,583
[NYGGLATHO]
What do you want to do?

253
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,041
You don't have to
stay here, you know.

254
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,541
I can arrange something.

255
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,000
Off-island accommodations,
maybe?

256
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,958
You say that like I won't
get stabbed in the back

257
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,791
the moment I take
my eyes off you.

258
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,083
Wow, so mean!

259
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,416
What kind of monster
do you take me for?

260
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,750
[WILLEM]
The kind that eats people.

261
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,666
Anyway, I'm just not
one of those guys

262
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,708
who quits a job
they've committed to.

263
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,750
I fully intend to
stay right here.

264
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,625
Uh! Oh, I had a feeling
I could count on you!

265
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,250
It'll be fun after so long to
get to take care of you again.

266
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,208
That makes me kinda happy.

267
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,125
[WILLEM] Don't get
the wrong idea, Willem.

268
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,125
This isn't about a man and a
woman spending time together.

269
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,708
It's about a troll trying to
fatten a tasty-looking lamb

270
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,583
before she devours it.

271
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,958
Care to share what
that scary look is for?

272
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,708
Just to confirm.

273
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,791
You're not planning
to eat me, correct?

274
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,125
No, I'm not.

275
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,958
Genuinely, my only desire
is to take care of you.

276
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,666
Don't you know that trolls are
bound by their natural instinct

277
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,166
to serve every guest
with dedication?

278
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,083
Trust me. I swear I won't
try to eat you, yet.

279
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,541
So, in return...

280
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,250
Let me use my other instinct!

281
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,333
Can we get back to the topic?

282
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,833
This building is the
weapon warehouse

283
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,875
I'm supposed look after,
is that right?

284
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,208
[NYGGLATHO]
You're so mean to me.

285
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,708
And yes, this is the building.

286
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,083
But it looks nothing
like a warehouse.

287
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,708
Where do they store all the guns
and artillery in here?

288
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,583
Let's continue the
discussion tomorrow.

289
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,458
It has gotten rather late.

290
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,750
Plus, the naughty
walls have ears.

00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,791
--[LAKHESH] I'm sorry!
--[TIAT] Hey! Stop shoving me!

292
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,791
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

293
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,375
Oh, hi, Nygglatho.

294
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,416
Thanks for having us!

295
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Yes! Please, have us!

296
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,625
Get back to your rooms, ladies.

297
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,250
'Kay, but before we do,
we think it'd be nice

298
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,375
to properly greet
the new caretaker.

299
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,250
Go now, or I'll eat you.

[ALL whimpering]

301
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,000
[ALL]
Goodnight, Miss Nygglatho.

302
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,291
[NYGGLATHO]
Goodnight, girls!

303
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,083
Well, how about I show
you to your room, then?

304
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,666
It kinda seems like I'm not
the only one allergic to you.

305
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,291
[gasps] Oh, you big meanie.

306
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,583
[sighs] All, right.

307
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,333
If anything, this
place is unexpected.

308
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,708
[ALMARIA] Poppa!

309
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,541
Hey, Pops?

00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:32,833
Sheesh, Poppa, how long are you
planning to stay asleep for?

312
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,708
[TIAT]
You think he's asleep?

313
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,250
[LAKHESH] Don't ask me.
I've never seen a man before.

314
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,500
[PANNIBAL] We should probably
keep it down, guys.

315
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,250
[GIRLS yelp]

316
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,291
[TIAT] Why do you always have to
shove me around like that, gah!

317
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,875
[PANNIBAL] Hey, caretaker.
Beautiful night, isn't it?

318
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,208
We're here!

00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,041
So, who might you girls be?

--My name's Collon!
--I'm Pannibal.

same time, he can't hear you!

Sorry, I'm Lakhesh.

00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:06,416
[WILLEM] Collon, Pannibal,
Tiat, and Lakhesh.

326
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,833
Okay, I think I've got
your names down.

[GIRLS gasping]

328
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,000
Where'd you come from, mister?

329
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:11,875
What's your name?

[GIRLS chattering]

331
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,166
And out of all these questions
you've been asked,

332
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,583
which one will you choose
to answer first?

333
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,458
I guess I might as well
go with your question

334
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,458
to start this thing off.

335
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,916
Spicy meat dishes are
usually my favorite,

336
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,250
and I can't stand
reptrace cuisine.

337
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,416
Nygglatho and I are basically
a farmer and her lost lamb.

338
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,541
And I lived on Island
Twenty-Eight until this morning.

You can call me Willem.

I hope you girls like me.

gonna stay?

00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,583
[WILLEM]
Probably.

346
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,708
[GIRLS]
Ohh!

347
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,250
[WILLEM]
It's not that big of a deal.

348
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,833
Oh, but it is.

349
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,458
You have to understand, none of
the caretakers with the military

350
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,000
have ever lived here before.

351
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,833
Yeah, Nygglatho did
mention that.

352
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,541
[CHTHOLLY]
Oh, good grief.

353
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,458
How could you possibly think
this was a good idea?

354
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,458
You were clearly told to
give him space, weren't you?

355
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,916
[TIAT]
Um, we sort of, uh...

356
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,750
[COLLON]
Curiosity got the best of us!

357
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,166
You should have known better.

358
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,291
We don't have the kind of
power to resist Curiosity!

359
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,250
Should I let Nygglatho know?

360
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,083
[GIRLS whimpering]

361
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,166
--[TIAT] Have a good night!
--[PANNIBAL] Goodnight!

362
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,208
[COLLON]
Nice to meet you, Willem.

363
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,375
See you tomorrow!

364
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,458
I swear, those girls.

365
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,958
Sorry about that.

366
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,083
The little ones tend to get
pretty worked up.

367
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,333
I don't mind at all.

368
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,875
I'm actually used to
dealing with children.

369
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,500
But, what are they doing here?

370
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,875
Well, whatever you do, try not
to spoil them too much, okay?

371
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,458
We don't want it going right to
their heads, and it will, so...

372
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,083
[WILLEM chuckles]
I'll try.

373
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,458
[WILLEM]
Huh?

374
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,416
Oh, um. So, about Pannibal.

375
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,083
Sorry she attacked you.

376
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,583
She didn't mean anything by it.

377
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,166
For what it's worth,
I'm not mad.

378
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,958
You provided hot water
immediately,

379
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,666
so I even avoided
getting a cold.

380
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,875
Good. Good.

381
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,125
One more thing.

382
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,375
Um...

383
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,541
Chtholly.

384
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,958
That's my name. It's Chtholly.

385
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:08,625
[WILLEM]
Mm?

386
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,000
It's really belated.

387
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,958
You know, because the time
we've spent in the town

388
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,375
with the fairy tale thing and
the cat, and never mind...

389
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,333
Oh, right. Gotcha.

390
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,583
It's a pleasure. I'm Willem.

391
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,583
Oh, yep.

392
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,000
I know.

393
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,916
I was told that.

394
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,000
[CHTHOLLY]
Anyway. Sorry to disturb you.

395
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,208
Good night.

396
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,083
Wait, just for a minute.

397
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,166
There's something I'm
kind of confused about.

398
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,208
Real quick.

399
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,666
My understanding is
I'm a caretaker

400
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,250
for special military weapons.

401
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,208
[CHTHOLLY]
Correct.

402
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,625
And we're in a warehouse,

403
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,833
a warehouse that's used
to store those weapons?

404
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,208
[CHTHOLLY]
That's right.

405
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,166
[WILLEM] Then why does this
look absolutely nothing

406
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,250
like a warehouse? Why don't I
see a single weapon anywhere?

407
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,791
And, for the love of
all things confusing,

408
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,208
please at least answer this...

409
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,125
Who are you girls?

410
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,458
And why are you living
in a military facility.

411
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:07,083
[gasps] Did you take this job
without knowing we were here?

412
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,208
Yeah.

413
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,708
And you spent time
with the little ones

414
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,208
without knowing anything?

415
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,708
Yeah.

416
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,916
Let me, take a wild guess.

417
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,083
You're one of those people

418
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,125
who just goes with
the flow, aren't you?

419
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,041
[WILLEM grunting]

420
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,125
[CHTHOLLY sighs]
Oh, very well.

421
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,833
I can clear this up. The answer
to the first set of questions

422
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,833
lies in the second set, and the
answer to the second set,

423
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,791
well...

424
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,250
It lies in the first set!

425
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,583
Yeah, real clear.

426
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,791
[CHTHOLLY]
Try not to over think it.

427
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,791
The truth is, it's us.

428
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,791
We are the special weapons you
were sent here to care for.

429
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,791
[WILLEM]
What...?

430
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:42,750
Make sense?

431
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,541
We're all so glad you've come.

432
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,500
Starting tomorrow,
you'll be our new caretaker!

433
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,875

Here you go.

434
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,791
Thank you, looks good!
I'm so hungry!

435
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,708
Should be as good as it looks.

436
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:35,166
Come on! It's the night before
the final battle, Pops!

437
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,000
Nothing interesting to say?

438
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,750
Huh, like what?

439
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,250
"Once this war ends, I'll get
married and have kids,"

440
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,666
y'know, somethin' like that?

441
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,625
Yeah, I dunno.

442
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,541
Seems like asking for bad luck.

443
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,750
Why, because it's the kind
of thing characters always

444
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,041
like to say right before
they're killed?

445
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,333
When they get taken out in the
beginning it's supposed to be

446
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,250
more dramatic. I understand
that reasoning. I really do,

447
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,333
but I think it's sadder

448
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:00,041
when characters you're
attached to die.

449
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:02,875
[ALMARIA]
Either way, though.

450
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,291
Must be awful to get killed
off because the creator's

451
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,958
just an idiot. No matter
their absurd reasoning.

452
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,625
Well, yeah.

453
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,166
Now, Pops, you're heading
into the final battle,

454
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,041
which means we need
to find you inspiration.

455
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,375
Something concrete you can
hold on to in order to survive!

456
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,833
You know, like a reason
to come back here.

457
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,583
Anything'll do.

458
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,666
[ALMARIA]
You've gotta find one.

459

You've got to.
Because if you don't,

send you off with a smile.

Butter cake.

462
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,625
Do what?

463
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,708
Yeah, your butter cakes
are pretty incredible.

464
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,416
You should bake an extra-large
one for my next birthday.

For real?

466
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,541
You'll fight to return alive
just to eat some cake?

467
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,250
Why, you got a
problem with that?

468
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,500
No, I don't. I just
thought that maybe...

469
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,125
[ALMARIA]
Fine, whatever.

470
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,041
I'll settle for butter cake.

471
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,333
In return, since you
suggested it,

472
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,583
I'll feed you so much
of that cake

473
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,125
you're bound to get heartburn.

[NARRATOR 1A]
Unfortunately, the young fighter

475
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,416
would never return home.

Less than a year later
his world would be gone,

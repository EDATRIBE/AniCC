[CHTHOLLY humming]

2
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,750
[NYGGLATHO] We've received
a message for you.

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,708
You've officially
been ordered to report

4
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,958
to the base on Island Forty-Nine
at noon tomorrow.

5
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,500
[WILLEM]
About the surface thing?

6
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,000
[NYGGLATHO] Makes me wonder
if they plan on using

7
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,833
one of our girls to help
with the rescue effort.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,125
[WILLEM]
Not exactly excited.

9
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,333
Oh, no, forgot the pepper.

10
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,791
Okay. Which is pepper?

11
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:17,833
[SOLDIER 8A]
Get a move on!

12
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,625
[SOLDIER 8C]
Need medicine here!

13
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,458
[GRICK] We've sent word to
the Guardian Wings Military.

14
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:26,291
Just gotta take it easy.
Help should arrive fairly soon.

15
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,833
Yeah, that's a lot
easier said than done.

16
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,291
[GRICK]
It'll be fine.

17
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,166
Legitimitates, or the Fourths.

18
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,583
Won't run into them for a while.

19
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,625
Here!

20
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,875
And why do you think that?

21
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,125
I think that because I
know they tend to avoid

22
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,208
living close to their own kind.

23
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,500
There shouldn't be any
of 'em around here now.

24
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,541
Huh, had no clue.

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,708
Rhan, did you know about that?

26
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,583
[RHANTOLK]
Humans unleash the beasts,

27
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,125
and fill the world with...

28
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,083
They fill it with ashen truth.

29
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,041
[NOPHT]
Seriously, Rhan!

30
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,583
Your bad habit is showing!

31
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,625
What does Nygglatho
always tell you?

32
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,041
When it comes time to eat,
you need to focus on food!

33
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,541
Eat up already!
Open your mouth wider!

34
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:17,583
They really are just a couple
of children, aren't they?

35
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,250
Willem was right on the money.

36
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,208
[MOGDAMAN] We want to send a
rescue squad to the surface.

37
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,541
But the Plantaginesta, the
Moby-class transport airship

38
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,166
we would use, is currently
being remodeled.

39
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,958
It won't be ready for 15 days.

40
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,625
What the heck do
you need to have

41
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,750
such a big ship for, anyway?

42
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:39,875
[MOGDAMAN]
What?

43
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,458
[MOGDAMAN] Watch your mouth,
Second-Grade Technical Officer!

44
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,958
I'm a First-Grade Technical
Officer, you know!

45
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,750
I'm your superior!

46
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,666
Pardon me, First-Grade
Technical Officer, sir!

47
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,583
Please excuse this country
boy's lack of manners.

48
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,458
Forgiven. I may be a
first-grade technical officer,

49
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,625
but I still have
some compassion.

50
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,291
Now, let's get back on topic.

51
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,291
The survey team on the <i>Saxifraga</i>
was commissioned to excavate

52
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,916
specific ruins of
the emnetwihts.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,666
They were rather successful and
retrieved numerous relics,

54
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,708
so we need a big ship to
bring everything back.

55
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,916
Understand, Second-Grade
Technical Officer?

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,208
Yeah-huh.

57
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,583
[MOGDAMAN grunting]

58
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,875
Understood, First-Grade
Technical Officer, sir!

59
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,708
But the longer the
rescue op is delayed,

60
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,833
the more danger the
survey team faces.

61
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,250
We know, that's why we
sent two swords with them

62
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,916
in the first place.
And I hope they do their jobs,

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,208
even if they must sacrifice
their own lives.

64
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,250
[clattering]

65
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,166
Huh?

66
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,291
Is there anything wrong?

67
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,458
No, not at all.
You're absolutely correct,

68
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,583
oh wise First-Grade
Technical Officer, sir.

[clears throat]

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,958
I can't read a disfeatured's
facial expressions.

71
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,125
Here.

72
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,041
I want you to go through this.

"Ground Level K96-MAL Ruins.

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,958
[MOGDAMAN]
Once you read it,

76
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,250
you'll be able to appreciate
the importance of this survey.

No doubt about it, this is Gomag

It's... It's my hometown.

On the next page,

you'll find a list
of their findings.

00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,166
You know, talismans
and the like.

85
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,666
Those objects are precious
and informative.

What is it, Second-Grade
Technical Officer?

93
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,208
A favor. I would like
to ask one.

94
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,125
[laughs] Well,
that took forever.

95
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,583
Sorry. It's kind
of a long story.

Give me a second.
I just need to finish this.

That was delicious.

You ready?

100
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,625
Why did you come
with me again?

101
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,916
I wanted to buy myself
something, silly.

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,666
I also have a huge list of
things from the girls.

Well, you seem to be
enjoying yourself.

104
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,250
It isn't often you and I
can take a leisurely stroll

105
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,375
all by ourselves.

106
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,916
In fact, I don't think
that's ever happened.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,500
What about when we first met?

108
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,416
We ran all over
the place that day.

109
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,000
[gasps]

110
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,583
Uh?

111
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:54,291
Um, that's true, but it
didn't like, you know...

112
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,958
It didn't have the
same feel back then.

a cute missus I see?

Yes! We are,
thank you very much!

Huh?!

[CHTHOLLY laughs]

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,250

00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,250
[WILLEM] Are you finished
shopping now, "missus"?

for all your help.

right here?

Oh, come on.

know you know the answer.

Mm?

00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,958
You see, I don't care
where we are.

136
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,041
I just want...

137
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,291
I mean, all I want
is to be with you.

138
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:21,250
[sighs] I honestly have
no clue what you see in me.

[BOTH laugh]

140
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,250
[WILLEM] I was ordered to send
a fairy soldier to the surface.

141
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,958
[CHTHOLLY]
Yeah?

142
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,000
[WILLEM]
I picked Nephren.

143
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,708
And I'll be going with her.

144
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,833
[CHTHOLLY]
Right.

145
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,208
[WILLEM]
I don't think I can sit around

146
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,333
and wait for someone
to return anymore.

147
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,875
Also, I'm interested in a sword
they found on the surface.

148
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,875
A sword?

149
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,500
[WILLEM]
It's called Lapidemsibilus.

150
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,083
I believe it has
a special ability

151
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,833
to keep its wielder in
optimum mental condition.

152
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,750
[CHTHOLLY]
Mm.

153
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,875
So listen. I know you're
putting on a brave face.

154
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,791
The disintegration might
worsen at any moment.

155
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,416
My hope is that
this sword could help.

156
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,875
If it ever came down to it.

157
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,625
You're worried about me, then?

158
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,333
Did you really think
I would not be?

159
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,291
[CHTHOLLY] I don't think there's
any reason to worry.

160
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,250
Nothing has happened
since that one time.

161
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,458
I even sparred for a while
with Tiat the other day,

162
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,125
and I was fine afterward.

163
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,708
I feel great, so don't
worry so much.

164
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,583
You realize you're not
a leprechaun anymore?

165
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,708
[gasps]

166
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,166
So there's no telling
what's happening

167
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,458
inside your body right now.

168
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,666
I'm begging you,
please don't push yourself.

169
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,708
So then, when are you
supposed to be leaving?

170
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,250
Oh, not for a while yet.

171
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,291
You'll look after the girls?

172
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,291
[CHTHOLLY]
I'm going, too.

173
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,291
[WILLEM]
Huh?

174
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,083
I said I'm going with you.

175
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,750
Did I not just literally
beg you not to push yourself?

176
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,083
Yes, you did!

177
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,375
But I won't sit around
waiting for you to return.

178
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,458
--I don't think I could bear it.
--Absolutely not.

179
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,583
That excuse isn't
gonna fly with me.

180
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:14,083
You are not a fairy anymore,
and there's no sightseeing.

181
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,291
You think I'd want
to go with you

182
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,541
just to do some sightseeing?!

183
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,250
Wait. No, that's not what
I'm saying at all.

184
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,625
What I mean is, it's not
a place to go for fun.

185
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,791
You think this is all about fun?

186
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,000
Now, you've made me mad!

187
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,750
Now, I'm going with you,
no matter what!

188
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,875
Calm down.

189
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,125
You know that's not
gonna happen!

190
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,875
[CHTHOLLY] Looks like it's
gonna happen, after all!

191
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,500
Yay for permission!

192
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,458
Yeah, if you say so.

193
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,708
Hold on, are you mad at me?

194
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,833
Don't you realize why you
got permission to go?

195
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:49,875
Let's see, isn't it because
you vouched for me?

196
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,041
[WILLEM]
Sort of, I guess?

197
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,166
To be blunt, he thought
you were my lover.

198
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,125
Your lover...?

199
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,791
[CHTHOLLY laughs]

200
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,083
[MOGDAMAN grunting]

201
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,916
[WILLEM] Apparently, officers
often take lovers on trips

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,291
as their secretaries.

203
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,666
That is what he thinks
I'm doing.

204
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,125
Ha!

205
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,250
Your lover. [laughs]

206
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,333
I'm okay with that!

207
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,291
Well, that's great, but I'm not.

208
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,458
All right.

209
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,958
Then we can go back to "missus."

210
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,166
Oh, for pity's sake.

211
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,583
Look, truth be told,

212
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,458
I would rather not be separated
from you, either, okay?

213
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,541
[gasps] Wait a second!

214
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,041
I'm happy, but also sad because
it wasn't a proposal, was it?

215
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,833
[WILLEM]
Of course not.

216
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,500
[CHTHOLLY hums]

217
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,875
"I would rather not be
separated from you, either."

218
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,958
Oh, no, I totally
forgot the pepper!

219
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:54,041
It's second from the right,
window side.

220
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,208
[CHTHOLLY]
Pepper!

[ITHEA]
T.O.

224
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,541
Hey, T.O.

225
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:12,791
Is that Ithea?

226
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,375
You betcha.

227
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,500
Your beloved Ithea
Myse Valgulious.

228
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,875
If you want anything
for breakfast,

229
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,000
best to hit the mess hall soon.

230
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,708
Yeah, okay. I'm up. I'm up.

231
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,750
[crash]

232
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,458
Owie.

233
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,083
You were being my
blanket, Ren?

234
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,625
That's why I felt
so warm. Thanks.

235
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,750
[NEPHREN]
You're welcome.

236
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,166
It gets chilly this
time of year,

237
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,000
and I didn't want you
to catch a cold.

238
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,333
[ITHEA]
When you think about it,

239
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,083
shouldn't this scenario be
ridiculously scandalous?

240
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,500
Why doesn't it seem
that way, though?

241
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,416
That's because your mind
hasn't been corrupted

242
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,541
by what they call
"the gutter" as of yet.

243
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,458
Not to mention Nephren
basically has pet status.

244
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,791
Are you okay with that?

245
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,125
Providing emotional
support is crucial.

246
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,458
It's a worthwhile role.

247
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,416
[ITHEA]
Is that so?

248
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,958
Anyway, what were you
researching all night?

249
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,041
It was a dug weapon,
Lapidemsibilus.

250
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,958
That sword could stop Chtholly's
mental disintegration.

251
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,333
[gasps]

252
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,458
[laughs]

253
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,208
Jeez, what now?

254
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,166
Nothing, just wondering if she
has a real chance with you.

255
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,708
Does she?

256
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:18,541
Don't be ludicrous, she had
a chance this entire time.

257
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,875
Some may hold out longer,
but no man can remain

258
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,625
unfazed forever when
a cute girl likes him.

259
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,000
But I still can't give in,

260
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,833
which is why I'm trying
to keep her at arm's length.

261
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,875
Wow.

262
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,208
You tell her, I'll end you.

263

264
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,208
[CHTHOLLY]
You slept with Nephren?!

265
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,916
Why does everyone have
to make it a big deal?

266
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,208
You know Nephren is just
like a daughter to me.

267
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,083
Why are you being
so weird about it?

268
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,375
Spare me. You're not that
much older than she is!

269
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,875
[WILLEM] Yeah, well, people
tend to assume I'm young,

270
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,416
but I'm actually
over 500 years old.

271
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,291
True, and I imagine Nephren

272
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,416
must have snuggled up
in there with you herself.

273
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,625
No need to imagine.

274
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,791
But I still have a hard
time accepting this!

275
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,041
I know you can sense people
sneaking up on you!

276
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,916
I can only sense the
hostile people, though.

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,208
I don't notice the mostly
harmless ones.

278
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,750
Then let me ask you this.

279
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,083
What if the person crawling
in your bed was Nygglatho?

280
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,250
Defenestrated in
two seconds flat.

281
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,208
That's not how it
went with Nephren.

282
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,625
Nygglatho might not
technically be hostile,

283
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,875
but she is what I consider
a dangerous woman,

284
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,875
a very dangerous woman.

285
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,833

M'kay.

00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,083
What if it were me?

00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,416
[WILLEM]
Uh. I don't know, let me think.

288
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,625
I'd have to throw
you out, obviously.

Please be more
careful in the future.

You don't want the little ones
to start jumping in your bed.

At least I assume you don't.

294
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,875
Right. No.

295
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,875
[NYGGLATHO]
I give up.

296
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,666
I have no idea why Chtholly
isn't a leprechaun now,

297
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,000
or why her hair changed color.

298
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,833
What about you?

299
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,583
Will the dug weapon on the
surface really come in handy?

301
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,541
[WILLEM gasps]
Oh, sorry.

302
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,708
It's just...
Chtholly was acting...

303
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,000
I dunno, kinda weird
this morning.

00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,375
Huh?

[CHTHOLLY humming]

306
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,416
[WILLEM] So I said I'd
throw her out, obviously.

307
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,000
I thought she'd be mad over why
it's okay with Ren and not her,

308
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:28,291
but she just walked away.
You think she's sick again?

[NYGGLATHO laughs]

310
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,083
Y'know, for such
a perceptive guy,

311
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,000
you can be unbelievably obtuse.

312
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,708
[WILLEM]
What's that supposed to mean?

313
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,708
She's not sick,
she's just elated

314
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,541
that you put her in the same
category as you put me.

315
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,916
And that would make her
elated because why?

316
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,666
[NYGGLATHO]
Because I'm the rival in love

317
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,875
she's most worried about.

318
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,083
And if you treat both of us
the same, that would mean

319
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,666
you also see her as more
than just a little girl.

320
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,958
Hold on. Her rival in love?

321
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,500
Yes.

322
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,250
Are you saying she believes
you and I could get together,

323
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,708
like in a relationship?

324
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,875
[NYGGLATHO]
That is the implication.

325
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,291
She's so young.

326
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,458
I suppose at that age you
have the tendency to get

327
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,541
the wrong idea about
these kinds of things.

328
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:13,208
[NYGGLATHO] I wouldn't say
it's the "wrong idea," exactly.

329
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,500
You may find this rather
difficult to accept,

330
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,833
but I actually do rate you
quite highly as a man.

331
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,041
[coughing]

332
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:26,000
[NYGGLATHO] Honestly, I wouldn't
mind being with a man like you.

333
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,708
After all, our races aren't
too terribly different.

334
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,333
And because of that, I might
even be able to provide you

335
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,000
with children of
your own someday.

336
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,916
If I could be a part
of your happiness

337
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,166
in five or ten years' time,

338
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,250
well, there is nothing
I would love more.

339
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,791
[laughs] Now, that being said,

340
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,250
Chtholly's happiness
is a priority for me.

341
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,625
So, don't worry.

342
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,250
I'm not about to go all out
for the kill just yet.

343
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,125
Nevertheless,
she simply can't help

344
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,458
but consider me
a genuine threat.

345
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,125
Oh, I hope that makes sense.

346
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,166
[WILLEM] I'm gonna make a
really despicable request.

347
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,333
What might that be?

348
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:11,375
Can I pretend that, like,
I didn't hear any of that?

349
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,000
You're right,
that is despicable.

350
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:20,041
However, it's fine.
I completely understand.

351
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,541
--[PANNIBAL] Hurry!
--[COLLON] Yeah!

352
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,500
Last one there's a loser!

353
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,666
[LAKHESH]
Wait for me!

354
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,083
Hey girls, be careful.
Don't run!

355
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,666
[CHTHOLLY]
Do not run in the halls!

356
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,291
What do you think's
gotten into them, now?

357
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,583
[CHTHOLLY]
Shooting stars.

358
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,500
[GIRLS chattering]

359
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,416
[LAKHESH]
So pretty!

360
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,583
Look over there!

361
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,666
And over there, too!

362
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,375
Oh, yes, spectacular.

363
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,083
Oh, wow. There are
so many tonight.

364
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,333
Did you see that?

365
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,208
Here comes a whole bunch!

366
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,791
[CHTHOLLY, WILLEM laugh]

367
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,666
[gasps]

368
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,583
[TIAT]
Hold it right there!

369
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,791
[BOTH gasp]

370
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,166
But we're gonna miss all
the shooting stars!

371
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,625
Your hair's still wet!

372
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,333
You're supposed to dry it
right after a bath!

373
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,625
Do you wanna catch a cold?

374
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,041
Tiat's got that down.

375
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,375
She's playing "big sis"
to perfection.

376
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,000
It's hard to believe
not too long ago

377
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,583
I was the one running after her.

378
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,458
In fact, she's probably
imitating me.

379
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,333
[WILLEM] Ah, yeah.
I can totally see that.

380
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,208
Thank you.

381
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,916
[WILLEM]
Hm?

382
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,250
For looking out for me.

383
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,583
You know, taking me to
the surface and all that.

384
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,000
[WILLEM] Nah, I'm just doing it
for my own peace of mind.

385
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,500
Don't worry about it.

386
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,500
I don't care.

387
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,041
Thanks, anyway.

388
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,708
--[GIRLS chattering]
--[ALMITA] Look!

389
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,583
[TIAT]
What are you doing, Almita?!

390
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,250
[ALMITA laughs]

391
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,833
[crack]

392
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,083
[TIAT gasps]

393
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,125
[CHTHOLLY gasps]

394
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,166
[ALMITA screams]

395
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,500
Almita!

396
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,416
[WILLEM]
Make it!

397
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,250
[CHTHOLLY gasps]

398
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,000
[CHTHOLLY grunts]

399
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,333
[crash]

400
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,250
Chtholly!

401
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,500
Chtholly?

402
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,291
Chtholly!

403
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,291
Goodness.

404
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,500
Do you realize how
ridiculous you sound?

405
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,541
It's embarrassing.

406
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,750
Some grown-up you are.

407
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,791
You okay, sweetie?

408
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,083
It seems like she's
all right, too.

409
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,083
Chtholly!

410
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,458
[CHTHOLLY]
What are you doing?

411
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,083
Not that I mind.

412
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,166
But let's try this again,
from the top!

413
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,458
[WILLEM] You're not a
leprechaun right now.

414
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,041
[gasps]

415
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,958
You can't generate venenum like
that anymore, don't you get it?

416
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,583
What if things were to go wrong?

417
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,166
What--! What if you...

418
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,750
I thought I was...

419
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:44,041
I thought I was gonna lose you,
even though I was right here!

420
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,041
[WILLEM cries]

421
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,625
[sighs]

422
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,250
Well, you're one to
talk, aren't you?

423
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,666
I mean, with your
wreck of a body.

424
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,166
I'm perfectly fine.

425
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,875
I am a bit numb perhaps,

426
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,000
but it will go back
to normal in no time.

427
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,250
[WILLEM]
You're not pretending, are you?

428
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:09,041
No faith in me at all, huh?

429
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,916
You're all banned from the roof!

430
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,375
Get everyone downstairs
immediately!

431
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,791
All right, got it!

432
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,208
[NYGGLATHO] What's going on?
What happened out here?

433
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,791
Nothing too bad.

434
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,333
I'll take her up
to get a bath, now.

435
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,458
Think you can handle
the rest with Nygglatho?

436
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,333
[WILLEM]
Oh, yeah.

437
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,416
[CHTHOLLY]
You ready to go?

438
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,041
[ALMITA]
Yes, ma'am.

439
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,750
[ALMITA]
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,458
[CHTHOLLY] Tiat is the one
you should apologize to.

441
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,666
If you'd listened to her,

442
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,708
you wouldn't have put
yourself in danger.

443
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,916
[ALMITA]
Right. I know.

444
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,666
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,125
[CHTHOLLY]
Cover those ears.

446
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:53,958
[CHTHOLLY]
Ready to switch?

447
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,125
[ALMITA]
Yep!

448
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,666
[CHTHOLLY gasps]

449
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,333
[CHTHOLLY gasping]

450
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,500
[ALMITA]
Chtholly?

451
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,833
What's wrong?

452
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,750
[CHTHOLLY gasping]

453
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,958
[inaudible]

454
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,375
[CHTHOLLY gasping]

455
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,375
[CHTHOLLY]
Elq.

456
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,333

moonlit sorcery.

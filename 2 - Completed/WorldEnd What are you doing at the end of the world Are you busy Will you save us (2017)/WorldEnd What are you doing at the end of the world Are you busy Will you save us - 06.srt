1
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:12,583
[laughs]

2
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,708
I'm so glad you're here!

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,625
[GIRLS]
Welcome home!

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,375
[gasps] Chtholly?

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,666
[CHTHOLLY]
I'm back home.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,250
[CHTHOLLY]
Jerk.

7
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,125
[SOUWONG] You mean there's a man
here who can tune dug weapons?

8
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,416
No, no, no, no.

9
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,583
Sorry, it was not my
intention to frighten you.

10
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,166
I know this scary face
doesn't help.

11
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,583
However, it still seems like
you're telling me a tall tale.

12
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,000
I once knew a monster
that could tune dug weapons,

13
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,416
but he's long gone.

14
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,583
In there, huh?

15
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,125
[GIRL 06A]
Yes, Great Sage.

16
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,208
According to what I've been
told, he can tune dug weapons.

17
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,083
[SOUWONG] You've brought
him this far to meet me,

18
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,833
so we might as well
get on with it.

19
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,125
It's been a long time
since I've met a con man

20
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,291
with this much originality.

21
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,250
Hello? Souwong?

22
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,583
Really good to see you.

23
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,625
Wow, you look different.
In like a super old way.

24
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,500
No, that can't be
Black Agate Swordmaster?

25
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,958
No one's called me
that in a long time.

26
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,666
Magus of the Pole Star.

27
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,125
You look delighted to know
that we're both doing so well.

28
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,666
[SOUWONG] You spent 500 years
petrified on the surface?

29
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,916
I assumed you were dead

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,458
because my pulse tracing
never got any response.

31
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,625
None, ever!

32
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,416
Well, you wouldn't.
I was petrified,

33
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,750
so my heart wasn't beating.

34
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,958
[SOUWONG] Give me back
the tears I shed that day!

35
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,833
Ah, you mean you cried for me.

36
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,291
[SOUWONG]
No, I did not.

37
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,833
Don't be silly.

38
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,125
I would never waste my time
crying over someone like you.

39
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,916
Sure.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,916
So, what's your deal?
Why are you still alive?

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,541
What's it been...
500 years, now?

42
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:27,250
[gasps] You...

43
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,083
What is that?

44
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,166
[SOUWONG]
You weren't the only one

45
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,500
killed during battle, you know.

46
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:38,166
I was taken out at
the same time as Emissa.

47
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,333
However, just before I passed,
I was able to place a curse

48
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:45,208
on myself, a curse that
would alter my life force.

49
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,458
What I am now can no longer
be considered human.

50
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,875
But that's mainly because I
can't die of injury or old age.

51
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,541
I see.

52
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,625
Don't get the wrong idea,
your pity isn't necessary.

53
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,333
I'm actually very happy with
the way my life has turned out.

54
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,375
[WILLEM]
No. It's not about your story.

55
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,875
I'm more shocked that Emissa
was killed in battle.

56
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,541
[SOUWONG sighs]

57
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,708
[WILLEM]
Look at 'em go.

58
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,333
Ya think that's Emissa?

59
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,458
Nah. It's most likely Hillgram.

60
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,750
Saw some gaping ridgelines
on the way here.

61
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,916
[sighs] Makes sense.
Will you look at this party?

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,250
It's practically
full of monsters.

63
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,708
[SOUWONG]
You're one to talk.

64
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,958
Huh, Black Agate Swordmaster?

65
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,500
How many times do
I have to tell you

66
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,958
to stop calling me
that, Souwong?

67
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,500
Also, you seriously need
to stop wearing that cape.

68
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,166
You look ridiculous.

69
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,625
[LILLIA laughs]
Now, that's not fair.

70
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,166
I mean, he's so itty-bitty,

71
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,583
how are we supposed to spot
him if he's not wearing it?

72
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,041
But it is ridiculous.

73
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,666
[WILLEM laughs] I guess that
means it really does suit

74
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,958
the great Magus of
the Pole Star.

75
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,750
Ah! You two are so good
at getting on my nerves!

76
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,041
Mm?

77
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,375
[WILLEM] Well then,
eat this and try to relax.

78
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,916
It's one of Almaria's
special ginger cookies.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,666
Almaria baked
something for me?!

80
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,708
No, for me!

81
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,666
No, you're both wrong.
It's for...

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,958
--[SOUWONG yells]
--[WILLEN groans]

83
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,166
[crash]

84
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,250
[WILLEM groaning]

85
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,750
Good grief.

86
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,916
What am I gonna
do with you guys?

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,791
I haven't been able
to reminisce,

88
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,166
at least not before now.

89
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,291
Seems this job's helping
me deal with the past.

90
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,250
[gasps] Yes, of course!

91
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,250
That makes perfect sense!

92
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,500
You are the only one
who can tune carillons.

93
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:31,000
No one is more perfect for the
fairy warehouse caretaker job!

94
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,458
But now, I don't know if I
should leave you there to rot

95
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,208
or give you something
more fulfilling to do.

96
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,208
Not to interrupt your
brainstorm attack,

97
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,916
but you don't have to worry.
I'm perfectly fine.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,500
And I swore to return soon,
so I need to get back.

99
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,833
Get back? To where?

100
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,750
Are you talking about
the fairy warehouse?

101
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,208
[WILLEM]
Yeah.

102
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,583
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I just can't right now.

103
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,500
It's nice to know we're
both still alive, though.

104
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,708
[SOUWONG]
No so fast.

105
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,916
Before you leave,

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,750
there's someone I'd
like for you to meet.

107
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,750
[WILLEM]
Uh?

108
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,291
[SOUWONG]
But I should warn you,

109
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,000
this is probably someone you
never imagined you'd see again.

110
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,916
[WILLEM]
You can't be serious.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,875
You don't mean another one
of our friends survived?

112
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,416
We will be heading
for Island Two.

113
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,625
Ready an airship
for us immediately.

114
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,541
No, hang on a sec.
I never said I'd go!

115
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,625
Souwong! Wait!

116
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,916
[ELQ]
Room without an exit.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,333
Black cat that doesn't
stop meowing.

118
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,666
Who's the unfamiliar
blue-eyed girl?

119
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,208
[gasps]

120
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,333
[bed creaks]

121
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,666
That was a weird dream.

122
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,416
Please come back, Willem.

123
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,458
Please.

124
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,958
[WILLEM]
Oh, no.

125
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,125
She's gonna be so mad at me.

126
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,041
[WILLEM]
Fun, feels like we're entering

127
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,708
the temple of an evil clan.

128
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,208
[SOUWONG]
I may have known you forever,

129
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,416
but I still don't get
your bizarre style.

130
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,166
[WILLEM laughs]
Look who's talking.

131
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,416
Five hundred years,

132
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,416
and you're still wearing
a ridiculous white cape.

133
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,958
[SOUWONG] Don't make
it sound like a disease.

134
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,791
It's a part of my
very heart and soul!

135
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,166
I would never cast my cape
aside, not in a thousand years!

136
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:19,958
[WILLEM]
Thank you.

137
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,208
[SOUWONG]
Where did that come from?

138
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,000
Why would you thank me?

139
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,291
Just felt like saying thank you.

140
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,333
Don't worry about it.

141
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,041
[SOUWONG]
No, no, wait. Why not?

142
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,000
What are you grinning for?
Don't be weird.

143
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,708
[rumbling]

144
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,166
[SOUWONG]
Out on a walk, are we?

145
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,666
Well, it is a pleasant day.

146
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm meeting her?

147
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,375
Not her. Look lower.

148
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,791
[SOUWONG] Greetings, you
oversized piece of trash,

149
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,375
I've come to see you!

150
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,958
Uh! If it isn't the great Sage.

151
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,708
Wonderful timing. I was getting
unbelievably bored.

152
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:57,875
[WILLEM]
Mm...

153
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,125
[SOUWONG]
I've brought an old acquaintance

154
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,583
I'd like you to meet.
All right, Eboncandle?

155
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,166
Ah! Yes, of course,
I recognize you!

156
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,833
Yes, but where do I know you?

157
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,458
Oh! We fought...

158
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,791
Tell me, Souwong, please
tell me this isn't real

159
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,250
and it's all just a bad dream.

160
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,166
If you want, I don't
mind slapping you

161
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,083
so you can make
sure you're awake.

162
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,083
[WILLEM]
I think I'll pass.

163
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,583
[EBONCANDLE] It's been eons,
has it not, human brave?

164
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:30,500
[EBONCANDLE laughs]

165
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,333
[EBONCANDLE] I never
imagined the day would come

166
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,333
when our paths
would cross again.

167
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,833
Although I wish very much
that it were not so,

168
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,000
sadly, we are fated to always
cross swords, too.

169
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,166
Warriors like us are not
given such luxuries, uh.

170
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,958
Look, you can give all
that warrior crap a rest.

171
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,250
Really? How dreadfully boring.

172
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,333
Not to be rude, but why the
hell do you look like that?

173
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,250
The Eboncandle I fought in
the past had skin, flesh,

174
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,041
and you know, an actual
body from the neck down.

175
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,500
[EBONCANDLE] You ask
as if you weren't the one

176
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,250
who burned my
remains to a crisp!

177
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,208
Can you imagine my shock
when I awoke in this state?

178
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,458
This is your fault!

179
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,875
Although, it is not your fault

180
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,750
that I have had to consistently
use much of my power.

181
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,583
I've not had the strength
to heal myself completely.

182
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,791
I get it.

183
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,166
The "paradise" or
islands in the sky,

184
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,833
they were built by
the two of you.

185
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,333
That is correct.

186
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,166
In order to escape the seventeen
beasts, I used brute force

187
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,833
to elevate surface
land into the sky.

188
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:29,208
Somehow, it's managed
to last 500 years.

189
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,708
[EBONCANDLE] Eight-tenths of
it is thanks to my powers.

190
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,666
[EBONCANDLE laughs]

191
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,958
[WILLEM]
At this point, you have to know

192
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,958
what the seventeen
beasts are, right?

193
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,000
What the hell happened
to make them appear?

194
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,583
Where did they come from?

195
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:44,416
[EBONCANDLE] Hm... The beasts
are the true sin of humanity.

196
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,875
To begin with, they're ancient--

197
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,125
[SOUWONG] Do you remember
True World, by chance?

198
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,500
Uh. Now that you mention
it, yeah, I think I do.

199
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,750
Are you talking about that
really old, militant cult

200
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,250
we were ordered to take out?

201
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,500
[SOUWONG] Yes. The beasts
are biological weapons

202
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:00,250
that were born as a result of
True World's failed research.

203
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,625
[WILLEM]
Makes sense.

204
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,083
That's why emnetwihts are blamed
for destroying the surface.

205
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,083
It's because of them.

206
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,500
[SOUWONG]
Correct.

207
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:12,166
And they're not wrong.
Humans did destroy the surface.

208
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,916
But wouldn't you like to
take the surface back now?

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,250
[gasps]

210
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,958
[SOUWONG] You may be one
of the most annoying guys

211
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,750
I ever met. Rotten to the core,

212
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm talking personality,
heart, and soul-all of it--.

213
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,958
But you also have the best
and most reliable skills.

214
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,000
Which means you're more than
worthy to be a part of our plan.

215
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,541
In fact, you're a crucial
factor at this point.

216
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,750
Indeed.

217
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,791
[WILLEM] I thought the
surface was overrun.

218
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,583
Isn't it a danger zone
with beasts everywhere?

219
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,250
What are you planning?

220
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,083
--We will attack them ourselves.
--What?

221
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,083
Now that you're here,
we also have the ability

222
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,750
to use carillons that couldn't
be tuned or wielded before,

223
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,958
giving us more power
than we'd expected.

224
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,583
This is significant
progress for us.

225
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,333
The battle will more than
likely require all resources

226
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,375
from every Règles Aile city.

227
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,541
It will be a long road.
Dangerous.

228
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,416
However, we stand a good chance
of coming out on top this time.

229
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,750
We can procure as
many fairies as we need.

230
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,291
The only problem previously

231
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,625
was the shortage of
usable carillons.

232
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,750
What?

233
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,416
I--! Uh. Nothing.
Uh, nothing at all.

We are the special weapons

00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,041

It's you.

of their former youth.

really life forms.

to produce fairies from

Since they do not fear death,

00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,666
they make ideal,

Their life-spans are very short.

286

And their spirits are so fragile

287
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,333
that if they generate too much
venenum during combat,

288
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,416
memories of their past
lives can come back,

00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,041
Not the damn surface!

345
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,708
You know that!

346
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,166
What about you, do you consider
these islands your home?

347
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,166
Don't pretend like you
don't want to go back!

348
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,708
[WILLEM] Souwong, let's say
we do take the surface,

349
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,250
who are we gonna find there?

350
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,500
Will there be any of
our family or our friends

351
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,916
to welcome us home?

352
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,958
[SOUWONG]
Mm.

353
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,708
[EBONCANDLE] Great Sage,
I would give this fight up

354
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:03,291
for the moment, if I were you.
That is one resolute man.

355
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,500
Once he makes a decision
to protect something,

356
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:10,541
he will protect it, even if that
means sacrificing his own life.

357
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,333
[SOUWONG] You mean to tell me
you care more about fairies

358
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,416
who will soon die than
this world's future?

359
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,208
[WILLEM]
I do.

360
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,833
Now I need to go.

361
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:23,708
I promised to get back
to them quickly.

362
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,458
Then, Willem Kmetsch, I take
it this is your decision

363
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,916
on the matter today.

364
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,625
Yes, it is.

365
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,583
I always thought you
took the hero part

366
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,708
of heroic brave a
little too seriously.

367
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,291
So did I.

368
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,291
[BURONNY]
I've come with an urgent report.

369
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,041
It's about the wielder of
the dug weapon Seniorious.

370
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,458
Memories of her past
are returning.

371
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,750
Her mind has begun
to disintegrate.

372
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,958
[gasps]

373
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,000
[EBONCANDLE] And just like that,
he is gone.

374
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,458
Why did you not tell him
the truth about the beasts?

375
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,833
[SOUWONG]
I used to look up to him

376
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,958
like he was an older brother.

377
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,916
So if there's any way
I can help it,

378
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,041
I'd rather not make him hate me
more than he already does now.

379
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,791
[GIRL 2C]
No, it's mine!

380
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,708
[GIRL 2B]
Nuh uh, because I took it first!

381
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,916
Hey, do you guys know
where Nygglatho is?

382
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,041
[GIRLS]
She went up in the mountains!

383
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,083
Whenever someone doesn't
come back, she goes up

384
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,666
into to the mountains to
fight bears for a while.

385
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh, right.

386
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,708
Then I guess we'll be
having stewed bear

387
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,500
for dinner tonight, huh?

388
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,708
[GIRLS whine]

389
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,458
Hey, what's wrong
with you, Tiat?

390
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,750
You seem gloomy.

391
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,583
Uh, I dunno.

392
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,041
It feels like there's
a big hole in my head.

393
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,458
[COLLON]
Why? Because Chtholly broke?

394
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,750
[TIAT]
Maybe, yeah.

395
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,125
[ITHEA] You should know
she kept her promise.

396
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,500
She wasn't supposed
to return from battle,

397
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,083
but because of you she
somehow made it home.

398
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,958
And she did everything
she could to make sure

399
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,000
she had a little
bit of time left.

400
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,333
[WILLEM]
Yeah.

401
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,625
I knew she'd keep her promise,

402
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:11,625
even though I wouldn't say
or do what she wanted.

403
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,416
[WILLEM]
I did nothing for her.

404
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,625
[WILLEM]
Chtholly!

405
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,333
[CHTHOLLY]
Are you looking for something?

406
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,458
[ELQ]
Uh-huh. Jade-ebo!

407
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:15,000
[CHTHOLLY]
"Jade-ebo"? I see.

408
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,500
Hey, who are you?

409
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,625
My name is Elq!

410
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,166
[CHTHOLLY]
Elq, huh?

411
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,375
I can help you find
Jade-ebo, if you want.

412
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,750
I don't mind looking with you.

413
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,541
I mean, this place seems huge.

414
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,583
Who, me?

415
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:40,416
Oh, yes, my name is... huh.

416
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,750
I think I forgot. Who am I?

417
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,583
Huh?

418
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,458
[CHTHOLLY]
I don't know,

419
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,708
but I remember there's
something important.

420
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,666
Oh, yeah. I remember
I have to go back.

421
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,166
[ELQ]
No matter what?

422
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,625
No matter what.

423
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,333
Even though it's only gonna
bring you bunches of pain?

424
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:06,375
Yes, even then, because I have
a promise I have to keep.

425
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,708
Okay.

426
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,208
[CHTHOLLY gasping]

427
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,208
[ELQ laughs]

428
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,125
[WILLEM]
It's rare to see you drinking

429
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,916
anything other than tea.

430
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,375
[NYGGLATHO]
I'm glad you're here, Willem.

431
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:41,041
I'm so tired of being
forced to cry all alone.

432
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,291
[WILLEM]
In the past,

433
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,958
I wanted to fix things
that couldn't be fixed,

434
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:49,166
like unhappiness or the
tragedies people went through.

435
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,416
But I was always too powerless.

436
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,750
In the end,
I couldn't do anything.

437
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,416
I started to wonder
why I even tried.

438
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,125
Still do.

439
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,791
You'd think I would've
learned my lesson.

440
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:12,541
[WILLEM] But I wanted
to make Chtholly happy.

441
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,500
I'll never understand it.

442
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,791
What did she ever see in me?

443
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,458
[CHTHOLLY] How do you not
know the answer to that?

444
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,833
[CHTHOLLY]
Just think about it.

445
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,958
You gave me so
many of my firsts.

446
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:36,625
At that market, you became
the first stranger to help me.

447
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:40,041
You were the first to take me
somewhere with a great view.

448
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,791
The first to inspire all these
different emotions in me.

449
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,625
You're the first person
who let me lean on them,

450
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:50,083
and the first
opponent I lost to.

451
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:53,250
There're so many,
I can't keep count.

452
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,958
Which is why, well,
it seems pretty obvious

453
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:01,083
that you'd be the first person
I ever fell in love with.

454
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:04,125
Take the hint already,
you dummy.

455
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,083
[cries]

456
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,208
What happened to me, anyway?

457
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,750
I remember getting
to the warehouse

458
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,458
and having a weird dream.

459
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,875
And then I was mad that
you wouldn't come back.

460
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,625
[CHTHOLLY] Why are you
looking at me like that?

461
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,958
[WILLEM]
Welcome home, Chtholly.

462
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,916
[WILLEM cries]

463
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,458
Welcome home.

464
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:52,708
[CHTHOLLY sobs]

465
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,708
It's a miracle of love.

466
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,541
I don't know about it being
love or not, but, yeah,

467
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,708
I'd say this is definitely
a miracle.

468
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:06,791
Knowing Chtholly, though,

469
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,875
she probably ignored
the consequences

470
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:12,708
and paid a huge price to make
whatever this is happen.

471
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,666
[CHTHOLLY]
Next Episode: home, sweet home.

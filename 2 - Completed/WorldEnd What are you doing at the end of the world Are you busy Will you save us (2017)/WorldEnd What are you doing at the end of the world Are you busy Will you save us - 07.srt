I'm bored. I'm bored.

Come on, I know you've
gotta be bored, too, Rhan.

What is that? Ancient book?

Yes, one of yesterday's finds.

00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,083
Are you telling me you can
read emnetwiht writing?

15
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,458
I can connect the dots
between the words.

16

After that, it's just
an educated guess.

Ah. Well?

18
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,291
What are the emnetwihts saying?

[RHANTOLK]
The human race...

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,041
should have...
never come into being.

21
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:56,166
The visitors were who created
them, and the cost was great.

22
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,041
The gods failed. Blame the gods.

23
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,416
They failed us.
It was their biggest mistake.

24
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,041
That's crazy.

25
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:08,208
Remember, this isn't 100%.
It's a best guess.

26
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,750
[RHANTOLK]
Beasts by humans.

28
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,750
Oh, this might be
the other way around.

29
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,958
Humans unleash the beasts,

30
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:24,791
and fill the world with,
with the ashen truth.

Sounds to me like your
book is talking about

00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,291
the beasts destroying
the surface.

35
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,708
Like a prophecy.
Something wild like that.

36
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,125
It's not.

37
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,875
This seems to be a fairy tale
or a textbook of sorts.

38
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,791
I think it's more likely
humans created the beasts

39
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,166
in accordance with this idea.

40
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,416
At least, that would be
the natural assumption.

41
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,416

you're here and you've

particular to do.

Really?

you can learn something about
those things from me?

Yes.

I want to know more.
To start with, what are they?

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,833
Where and how were
the beasts even born?

138
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,500
Why did they wipe out the
emnetwihts on the surface?

139
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,083
You seem to care an
awful lot about them.

00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,250
Yes, while the beasts may
threaten your very existence,

141
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,083
they are the reason for ours.

142
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,291
Isn't it natural to be curious
about one's origin?

[NYGGLATHO]
I would learn a lot more

00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,375
Is there anything wrong?

148
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,541
Like with my body, I mean.

00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:43,000
[NYGGLATHO]
Hm. Is there something wrong?

150
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:46,291
Don't worry, I wouldn't
call it "wrong."

It was nice.

I appreciate you carrying
the stuff back, too.

154
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,875
I also had an errand to run,
so don't even mention it.

155
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,333
From what I understand,

156
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,541
you've been working at that
bakery for quite a while.

157
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,333
How did that happen?

158
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,333
[LAKHESH] The military brass
did not like the idea at all,

159
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:12,333
but Nygglatho helped convince
them to let me do it.

00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,416
And what do you think,

161
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,125
How do you feel about us
weapons working for money?

162
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,208
Is there something wrong

163
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,583
with wanting to be like
everyone else?

164
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,750
I feel like grown-ups are
supposed to ensure that kids

165
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,541
can do whatever they
want within reason.

166
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:29,500
As long as it's not dangerous or
plain wrong, it's okay with me.

Oh, I love you so much,

I've never had a father before,

170
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,958
but you seem like what
a father should be.

171
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,333
That's sweet to say.

172
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,708
I actually already consider
you girls to be my kids,

then what person would
that make our mother?

177
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,125
Maybe Nygglatho?

178
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,833
Doesn't seem fair to Chtholly.

179
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,583
All right, time to get going.

180
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,833
I have to start
the cooking, now.

181
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,416
[door closes]

182
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,916
[NYGGLATHO]
I gave you the silver test,

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,583
and it came up negative.

184
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,750
It did? Wow, okay.

185
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,250
What does that mean?

186
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,666
Silver powder has a natural
reaction to irregular death.

187
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,625
To put it simply,
it's a drug we use

188
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,500
to detect the
presence of spirits.

189
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,958
And since leprechauns
are a type of spirit,

190
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,458
I was expecting your blood
to turn black immediately

191
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,416
after I mixed it together with
the silver testing agent.

192
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,333
But there was no
reaction at all.

193
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,833
I don't know the reason,
but right now,

194
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:37,041
your body is not scientifically
a leprechaun's.

195
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,750
Wait! What are you
talking about?

196
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,041
Then, what's happened
to my body?!

197
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,083
I have no idea.

198
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,000
It's just the only conclusion
that I can make, well,

199
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,208
based on the findings.

200
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:52,041
Is that... Is that why
my hair is changing?

201
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,958
[NYGGLATHO]
There's the possibility

202
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,833
it could be a side
effect of your coma.

203
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,875
Nygglatho, what's going
to happen to me?

204
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,625
[NYGGLATHO]
You honestly don't feel anything

205
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,625
wrong with your body?

206
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,750
No, I don't.

207
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,833
I feel perfectly normal.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,958
Well, then. I guess try not
to worry about it for now.

209
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,708
Give me time to do
a little more research.

210
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,250
I'll figure it out.

211
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,666
And don't get any ideas
about dyeing your hair.

212
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,416
I doubt that it's gonna
bother Willem.

213
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,041
[gasps] Why would you say that?!

214
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,958
--[ding]
--Uh?

215
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,333
[NYGGLATHO] Until we get
all of this cleared up,

216
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,541
I want you to be sure and stay
away from your dug weapon.

217
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,125
There's just no telling
what might happen.

218
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,833
All right. I can do that.

219
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:53,000
Although, what am I gonna do
if I can't wield a sword?

220
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,250
[NYGGLATHO]
I dunno.

221
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,500
Maybe you can work on
getting married instead?

222
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,583
[gasps]

223
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,750
I'm being serious here.

224
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,416
Surely, you realize Willem's
contract will eventually expire.

225
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,458
Of course,
we both know how he is.

226
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:09,041
I'm certain he would stay
if we all asked him.

227
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,583
Then, can't we just do that?

228
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,458
Of course not!
Asking is way too easy.

229
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,208
Instead, we'll
aggressively remind him

230
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,375
that this is his home.

231
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,000
Then, no one will have
to ask him at all!

232
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,291
And obviously, the best way
to make him feel like

233
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,791
this is his home is for him
to have a wife and family.

234
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,666
What? Is that how
this stuff really works?

235
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,416
That is how this stuff works.

236
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,958
Honestly, I was considering
volunteering myself for the job

237
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:35,875
in question, but I thought--

238
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,375
[CHTHOLLY]
Please don't!

239
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,833
If you did, then...

240
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,041
then I wouldn't stand a chance.

241
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,041
I suppose it's time for you
to start fishing.

242
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,583
You better work some magic
and hook that man fast.

243
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,166
Don't procrastinate, either.

244
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,750
Otherwise, me or some other girl
will get him before you do.

245
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,333
[GIRLS chattering]

246
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,166
[GIRLS]
Time to dig in!

247
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,833
Whoa! It's heaven.

248
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,583
[ITHEA] You're a little
too good at this stuff, T.O.

249
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,125
What does that mean?

250
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,625
You knew she wouldn't eat it if
you only baked some for her,

251
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,083
so you found a way to make sure
she had her cake and ate it.

252
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,958
I gotta say, I'm impressed you
baked enough for all of us!

253
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,958
Pretty good,
if I do say so myself.

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,166
Hey, Ren. Where is she?

255
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,250
Um, probably her room.

256
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,875
Why, did something happen?

257
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,875
[NEPHREN] No, she just
prefers not to eat sweets

258
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,458
in front of anyone else.

259
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,375
[ITHEA] Mm-hm. She likes
to think she's fancy.

260
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,625
But, it's not as if it
bothers her that much.

261
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,916
You should totally take some
to her room yourself

262
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,083
and spend some sugary-sweet
"quality" time together.

263
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,125
Heh.

264
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,458
Don't make it sound
inappropriate.

265
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,916
[CHTHOLLY]
It's just, I dunno.

266
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,250
The other girls look up to me,

267
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,041
so I don't want to look
childish in front of them.

268
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,916
And um, from what
I've been told,

269
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,708
when I eat stuff like that...

270
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,666
...let's just say that I
could ruin my own reputation.

271
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,250
With sweets, I kinda go crazy.

272
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,958
What is that look for?

273
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,333
You're making a really big deal

274
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,041
out of something
that's ridiculous,

275
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,708
which sorta proves that
you're still a kid.

Excuse me?!

277

Shall I also get you some tea?

Well, my lady?

It smells so delicious.

It is.

Looks delicious.

286
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,958
Yes, that's because it is.

287
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,375
You sure?

288
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,916
Like, it's okay for me to eat
this in front of you?

289
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,750
Do you even need to ask?

290
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,500
Who do you think I
baked it for, silly?

291
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,958
I kept my promise. [cries]

292
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,583
I did it.

Yes!

I know I said this yesterday,

299
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,291
but welcome home, Chtholly.

00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,125
[CHTHOLLY cries]
I'm home.

302
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,750
I made it back. [sobs]

303
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,208
I finally got to say it.

304
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,583
[WILLEM]
And I finally got to hear it.

305

306
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,458

Does it look weird?

00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:12,375
It's a very pretty color,
and it looks great.

Oh, good. Thank you.

00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,083
[CHTHOLLY]
All right. I'm fine now.

312
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,666
You sure about that?

313
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,916
You're not feeling
sick or anything?

314
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,625
I'll be mad at you
if you push yourself.

315
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,708
[CHTHOLLY]
I'm fine!

316
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,083
And I have cooking, laundry,

317
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,458
and lots of other
responsibilities to focus on.

318
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,875
[WILLEM]
There's no reason to get upset.

319
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,416
[CHTHOLLY]
I know.

320
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,041
Just wait. I hope
that you're ready!

321
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,166
[GIRL 2I]
That's what I said!

322
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,708
Ladies! Did you
forget something?

323
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,000
Like wiping your shoes off
before coming inside?!

324
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,250
[GIRLS]
Huh? Sorry, Chtholly.

325
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:55,250
[CHTHOLLY] If I'm really freed
from being a fairy soldier...

326
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,750
If I'm really allowed
to pursue my dreams,

327
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:03,791
the same dreams as most
normal people, then...

328
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:08,625
I want to live, standing
side by side with him.

329
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:13,208
I want to see the same things,
walk down the same path,

330
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:17,666
eat the same food, and go to
the same places he goes.

331
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,375
I want to spend my whole life
that way, with him.

332
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,041
Getting better at homey
stuff is all well and good,

Look at who's making
another spicy meat dish!

And seems to me this one's

00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,041
tailored to a certain
someone's taste buds, too.

Oh, shut up and get
out of here!

Only the person cooking is
allowed in the kitchen anyway!

It's a very pretty color,
and it looks great.

Ooh-hoo.

What? You were eavesdropping!

Ha, ha! Amazing how girls in
love are so full of life!

What?!

Although, I don't know about
hogging the whole kitchen.

347
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,166
I mean, that sure
is a lot of work

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,458
just to get to one
guy's stomach.

349
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,083
[LIMESKIN]
How is said fairy soldier?

350
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,416
[NYGGLATHO] It's been around
five days since she woke up,

351
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,833
and so far, she seems fine.

352
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:27,916
[LIMESKIN]
Does she?

353
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,416
Good, that's wonderful to hear.

354
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,833
Uh, so...

355
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,333
What's with the getup?

356
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,041
[LIMESKIN]
They're civilian clothes.

357
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,791
I happen to be under suspension
for leading a losing battle.

358
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,666
I can't wear a
uniform right now.

359
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,875
Hopefully, this is
only temporary.

360
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,541
Uh-huh. So uh,

361
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,541
why are we making off-duty
lizards come all this way?

362
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,041
What's this conversation about?

363
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,666
To discuss Chtholly's
immediate future, right?

364
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,583
Did I not mention
that to you earlier?

365
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,083
I thought we three
needed to talk about it.

366
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,708
[LIMESKIN]
Hm?

367
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,541
Those girls are
technically weapons.

368
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,500
It's not like they can retire.

369
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,166
And, although Chtholly is not
a leprechaun at the moment,

370
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,000
she's still considered
a fairy soldier on paper.

371
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,708
Which means she can't turn down
an order to sortie, huh.

372
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,625
So then what about on your end?

373
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,708
You're first officer, could you
adjust the sortie lineup?

374
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,291
I could if I was in charge,
but there's a chance the order

375
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,583
might come from higher up
in the command.

376
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,708
Hold on.

377
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,083
You know the Great Sage?

378
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,000
Doesn't he have
military influence?

379
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,375
--[NYGGLATHO] Huh?
--[LIMESKIN] What?

380
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,958
Yes, I know him.

381
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,000
He's the military's top advisor,
everyone knows the Great Sage.

382
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,250
[WILLEM]
Then make sure he receives

383
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,833
a report that goes like this:

384
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,375
"In order to research
leprechaun physiology,

385
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,500
Technical Officer Kmetsch
has chosen soldier

386
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,291
Chtholly Nota Seniorious
to be a test subject."

387
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,875
[NYGGLATHO]
What is that about?

388
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,083
Just call it a hunch.

389
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,083
If I ask to be given
responsibility for her,

390
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,583
I bet he'll agree to it.

391
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,250
Mostly because he'll assume
that'll make me owe him one.

392
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,833
So what kind of relationship
do you imagine you have

393
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,166
with the Great Sage?

394
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,500
Don't worry about that,

395
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,666
worry about how we're
going to replace Chtholly.

396
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,666
Ithea and Ren can't handle it,
not if they're by themselves.

397
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,791
Oh.

398
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,000
Right, well, about that.
There's, uh...

399
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,375
[BOTH]
Hm?

400
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,666
[NYGGLATHO]
I heard from the guild

401
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,416
that beasts attacked
the surface survey team.

402
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,791
Apparently,
the <i>Saxifraga</i> was sunk.

403
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,125
Saxi...

404
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,875
It sunk? What of the warriors
that were aboard?

405
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,166
Both were a bit worn out,
however, apparently unhurt.

406
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,000
[WILLEM]
Hang on a second, you guys.

407
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,333
"Survey team"? "Both"?

408
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,916
Oh, yeah.

409
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I keep forgetting that you only
arrived here like a month ago.

410
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,708
Do you actually know how
many battle-ready fairies

411
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,708
we currently have?

412
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,541
Aside from Chtholly, three.

413
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,125
That's with Tiat, who hasn't
been paired with a sword.

414
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,333
No, we have five girls ready.

415
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,083
There's Ithea, and
Nephren, Tiat, I guess.

416
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,333
We also have Nopht and Rhantolk.

417
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,875
Well, where are those
girls right now?

418
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,083
You could try putting
two and two together?

419
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,333
No way...

420
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,916
Yes way.

421
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,458
I think that's correct, but
how can we really know...

422
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,708
[RABBIT SOLDIER 7A]
What is that?

423
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,583
It's a Beast!

424
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,708
[PIG SOLDIER 7A
whimpers, groans]

425
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:34,291
[DOG SOLDIER 7A whimpers]

426
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,375
[GRICK grunts]

427
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,791
You idiot!

428
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,000
That thing reacts
to sound and motion.

429
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,291
Just be still and keep quiet.

430
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,791
Come on. What the hell
is goin' on over there?

431
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,833
Huh? [grunts]

432
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,083
Wow, that is not a good sign.

433
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,958
[yells]

434
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,291
[yells]

435
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,791
[NOPHT] I expected a beast
to put up a better fight.

436
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,791
Completely insane.

437
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,458
[RHANTOLK]
Are you talking about the beast?

438
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,208
Or perhaps...?

439
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,833
[CHTHOLLY] Next Episode:
slight light, slight hope.

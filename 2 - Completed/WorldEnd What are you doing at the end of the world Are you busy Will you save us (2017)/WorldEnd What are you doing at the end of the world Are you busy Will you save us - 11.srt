1
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,041
[WILLEM]
Marry me.

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,666
I will make you happy, Chtholly.

3
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,583
[CHTHOLLY whimpers]

4
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,750
[laughs]

5
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,666
You're looking
particularly smug.

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,208
Smug, me?

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,208
I look smug?

8
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,250
I assume something good
must have happened?

9
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:49,708
Uh! Well, I guess so, yeah.

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,750
At least I think so.

11
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,500
You know, you're just
like an open book.

12
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,125
Hey, Rhan.

13
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,416
What do you think
finding happiness...

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,458
What do you think
it's all about?

15
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,833
To begin with,

16
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,625
happiness means different
things to different people.

17
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,833
To some, it means having
food on their table.

18
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,500
To others, it means
books on their shelf.

19
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,208
Some believe that
doing one's very best

20
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:18,083
is what truly matters
in the long run.

21
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,291
And some are only content

22
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:22,458
if they can overcome
hurdles in their path.

23
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,625
Some take joy in witnessing
and nourishing

24
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,041
the happiness of others.

25
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,291
While some, sadly,
revel in others' sorrow.

26
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:32,291
[CHTHOLLY] I gotta say, I didn't
expect such a long response.

27
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,458
You're giving me a joy thesis.

28
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:39,875
That said, most creatures do not
realize this about themselves.

29
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,791
They do not know what,
in actuality,

30
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,500
will bring them happiness.

31
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,250
Yet, they still talk about their
desire to find happiness

32
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,250
as if they knew where to look.

33
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,958
One day, such people may learn

34
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,666
that they were
blessed all along,

35
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,333
but they will never realize
it when they're happy.

36
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,000
In my opinion,
to know the truth,

37
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,916
one must simply listen
to their own heart.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,166
Make sense?

39
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,083
I hope that successfully
answered your question

40
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,125
and made you somewhat happy.

41
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,666
[CHTHOLLY]
Oh, god. Why?

42
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,958
Why is everything so awkward?

43
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,958
How did I pursue him like
I did up until yesterday?

44
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,541
[CHTHOLLY grumbles]
This is so hard!

45
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,666
[CHTHOLLY] Maybe I could
ask to kiss him again.

46
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,916
Would he accept this time?

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,875
Yeah, surely he would.
I mean, he did propose to me.

48
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,583
We're like a couple
now... Probably.

49
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,333
I'll give it a shot later.

50
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,041
Yeah, I'm gonna go for it.

51
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,791
I have a plan!

52
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,083
[gasps]

53
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,666
[CHTHOLLY]
What was that look about?

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,875
Oh, quit blushing!
You're embarrassing yourself!

55
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,250
[WILLEM]
So, listen.

56
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,500
[CHTHOLLY]
What is it?

57
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,583
About yesterday's, um,
well, you-know-what.

58
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,625
[CHTHOLLY]
Oh, yeah.

59
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,125
[WILLEM]
I, um...

60
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,416
I just want you to know I fully
intend to keep my promise.

61
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,208
I'll spend the rest of
my life making you happ--

62
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,458
[GRICK]
Oh! There you are!

63
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,958
Look left, you crazy kids!

64
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,416
It's okay, Willem.

65
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,625
I made a promise to
you, too. Remember?

66
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,833
I'll be with you forever.

67
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:01,875
[MALE WORKER 11A]
Hey Boss,

68
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,208
where do you want
me to put this?

69
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,416
[GRICK]
Oh, over there is fine.

70
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,666
Sorry to keep you waiting,
but I'm here now.

71
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,291
What is this?

72
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,083
[GRICK]
Supposedly, they're the forces

73
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,791
of the visitor Elq Hrqstn.

74
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,000
Elq Hrqstn?

75
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,166
[GRICK]
According to legend,

76
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,041
this world was once
home to gods.

77
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,791
But they attacked the humans
in a bid to wipe them out.

78
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,041
The one at the top
is Carminelake,

79
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,041
the middle one is Jadenail,

80
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,291
and the last one is, uh...

81
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,708
[WILLEM]
He's Eboncandle.

82
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,500
[GRICK]
Yeah, that's the one!

83
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,166
Ha, ha, ha!
Of course you'd know.

84
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,250
Of course.

85
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,541
After all, I did
personally fight him.

[BOTH]
Uh?

00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,750
Come on, Willem you're
tryin' too hard.

You don't have to be
like that with us.

89
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,958
It's true.

90
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,000
I should have asked them what
happened with the war.

91
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,750
After we took each
other out, I mean.

92
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,166
Yeah, whatever you say, friend,

93
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,166
but for now, let me lead you
to your destination.

made it back to us!

Can I say "I'm home" now?

97

Something feels weird.

[CREW MEMBER 11A]
It's a monster!

111
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,125
Yes, that much is fairly
obvious, you fool!

what the-- Come back here!

113

Oh, no.

Looks like we fell pretty far.

119
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,791
Apparently, there's been a
massive cave below Gomag City,

120
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,333
but what is it for?

121

00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,416
What were you thinking?!

128
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,958
You know your body can't
handle this kind of strain!

129
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,583
I'm fine, don't worry about it.

Think so.

[GRICK] I have a feeling we need
to get out of here, and fast.

133
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,958
Yeah, but how?

134
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,458
This looks to be the
underground ruins

135
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,541
where that idiotic officer
sent out a squad to scavenge.

136
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,958
You see all those markers
that lead down that way?

137
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,583
Hopefully, they'll
direct us to the exit.

138
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:28,083
Course, that's assuming the path
hasn't caved in somewhere.

139

Not long ago, I could've
just flown out.

There's no need to worry,
I promise to keep you safe.

Well, I'd rather be the one
keeping you safe.

142
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,208
I understand, but guardians
have the right

143
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,791
as well as the duty to guard
their charges, don't they?

144
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,750
Who are you calling your charge?

Yeah, poor guys.

how savage they are.

00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,666
[NOPHT]
Hey! Welcome back!

176
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,958
[NEPHREN]
Same to you.

177
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,125
Where's Rhan?

178
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,458
She's keeping watch over there.

179
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,916
Can we call it a day now?
Haven't we taken out enough?

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
[NEPHREN] You really
believe that's possible?

181
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,708
No, I just want this
nightmare to end

182
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,708
before more people get hurt.

183
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,916
Won't be over for
a while, though.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,500
Worried about Chtholly,
Grick, and that T.O...

185
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,208
I hope they get back
in one piece.

186
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,166
[PIG WORKER 11A]
Don't be stupid!

187
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,750
Leave that crap behind!

188
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,833
But I went to all the
trouble to find it!

189
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,500
We don't have time
for this nonsense,

190
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,166
our lives are far
more important!

191
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,750
[ARMADILLO WORKER11A]
I'm not saying they're not...

192
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,250
[NOPHT] "Our lives are far
more important," huh?

193
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,041
Wise words, I'd say.

194
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,333
Not that I actually
understand them.

195
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,125
[rumbling]

196
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,208
Get some rest.
I bet you're tired.

197
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,083
I'll take care of this.

198
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,583
Got a job to do.

199
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,958
Lives to guard, futures
to save, and all that.

200
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,000
Same old, same old,
but I love it!

201
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,666
[WILLEM]
Chtholly, wait!

202
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,291
[WILLEM panting]
Chtholly!

203
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,666
Please, stop.
What are you doing?

204
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,833
Willem, is that you?

205
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,791
Yes, it's me, but you need
to focus right now.

206
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,166
Don't lose sight of yourself!

207
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,458
Uh! Will ya look at that.

208
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,375
Amazing. I never thought
I'd get the chance to see

209
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,708
two of these within a
borgle's short lifespan.

210
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,916
Oh, ouch!

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,916
Poor thing's been
stabbed clean through.

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,416
[WILLEM]
Is that Seniorious's hex?

213
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,666
[GRICK]
Is who what?

214
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,291
[WILLEM] You know how
fairy tales have curses

215
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,125
that can turn people into
frogs and things like that?

216
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,000
This is the same idea.

217
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,541
A curse that can turn anyone,
god or immortal, into a corpse.

218
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,625
A world-altering
ability exclusive

219
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,541
to the holy sword Seniorious.

220
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,625
If it was used on her,
then there's no way

221
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,166
she was just an ordinary
little girl.

222
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,250
[GRICK]
Uh?

00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,583

00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,958
Chtholly!

[GRICK]
We gotta go!

226
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,375
Grab a hold of
your girl and run!

227
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,625
[WILLEM]
I got it.

228
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,291
Listen to me, Chtholly,
we're leaving.

229
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,916
Please, try to stay
in control of yourself.

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,083
Hang on.

231
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,375
I won't let anything
happen to you.

I'm here, right here.

Talk to me. What is it?

we're running out of time!

Please, Chtholly, say something!

[MOGDAMAN] Ah! Damn it, even
the pressure valves are blown!

What, they are?

00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,458
Is the ship done for then?

Hell, no!

I want you to bring me
every last thing

I could use to repair

[WILLEM] I never managed
to bring happiness

to anyone in my entire life.

That's why I wanted...
wanted to make you girls...

00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,958
All I wanted to do was
to make you happy.

253
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,625
But I just... I...

254
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,666
Why does everything always
have to end up like this?

[GRICK]
You okay, missy?

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,291
I just want to be
in there with them.

257
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,541
Of course you do.

258
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:32,541
I'm sure that would make
them feel a lot better.

259
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,625
[sighs] I'm sorry.

260
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,375
I wish I could've done more
than just bring her back.

261
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,916
It's all right.

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,875
This wasn't anyone's fault, so
there isn't anyone to blame.

263
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,583
We all knew the ice we were
walking on with her was thin.

264
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,291
[CHTHOLLY]
Where am I?

265
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,416
I'm doing this for one reason.

266
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,875
It's for my love.

267
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,333
For love?

268
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,916
[LILLIA groans]

269
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,708
For that reason alone,
I have come to slay a god.

270
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:14,875
And yes, I fully realize
I'm here on a fool's errand.

271
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,208
But I have no other choice.

272
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,458
This man, he's the walking
definition of stupid.

273
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,833
So I have to move on
these idiotic ideas

274
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,291
before he can think them
up for himself.

275
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:29,791
Because, Willem's a
complete and utter moron.

276
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,708
Time to say goodbye.

277
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,750
Rest in peace!

278
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,833
Uh?

279
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,208
[CHTHOLLY]
What was that?

280
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,291
Welcome back to me, Chtholly.

281
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,791
I do know you.
We've met before.

282
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,833
[ELQ laughs]
Do you wanna know something?

283
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,625
Because I have something
I want you to know!

284
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,000
Tell me.

285
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,125
[ELQ] A long, long time ago,
a race called "humanity"

286
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,291
was attempting to
destroy the world.

287
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,333
To prevent the destruction,
the Poteaus,

288
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,916
three gods who were
watching over the world,

289
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,458
decided to lead an army in order
to wipe out all of humanity.

290
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,291
Sadly, they failed.

291
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,541
A human brave
killed their master

292
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,541
before they could overpower
their enemy to save the world.

293
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,458
No one could stop
the humans now.

294
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:40,833
They turned into beasts and
obliterated everything.

295
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,291
[ELQ] I bet you're wondering
who their master was.

296
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,875
Her name was Elq Hrqstn!

297
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,125
She was the last
of the visitors,

298
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,541
and she died as a child.

299
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,291
You're Elq. That's your
name, isn't it?

300
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:58,208
[ELQ] Uh-huh, but it is also
the name of your soul.

301
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,833
[ELQ]
Fairies like you

302
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,166
are created from
the souls of children

303
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,291
who were too young to
realize they were dead.

304
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,791
Ever since the day Lillia
arrived and killed me,

305
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:11,875
I've been dreaming.

306
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,666
I dream of being like her,

307
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,583
I dream of being as brave
and as strong as her.

308
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,625
And I dream of putting
my life on the line

309
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,083
and fighting for
the people I love.

310
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,916
[CHTHOLLY]
Is that what I am?

311
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,041
[ELQ] Yes, that is what
all Leprechauns are.

312
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,291
[CHTHOLLY]
What will happen to me, then?

313
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,458
[ELQ]
You already know, do you not?

314
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,666
No dream is able
to last forever.

315
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,375
[CHTHOLLY] And dreams are
so quickly forgotten,

316
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,291
until nothing at all
remains of them?

317
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,750
[ELQ]
It's all right.

318
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,958
You made it back here
to me just in time.

319
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,416
Rhan!

320
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:04,041
Thank you. I'm so exhausted.

321
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,541
Would you like to switch out
with Nephren for a short time?

322
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,083
[NOPHT]
Nah, she's kinda preoccupied.

323
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,916
Besides, I figure we've
probably taken out

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,708
all the timere in
the area by now.

325
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,416
By the way, Nopht, how is
your body currently feeling?

326
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,375
Oh, it's super great for some
crazy reason, and what's more,

327
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,875
Desperatio's doing everything
exactly the way I want, too!

328
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,291
[RHANTOLK]
Same for me.

329
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,333
In which case, could what
we're experiencing somehow

330
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,208
be positive effects from that
rather dubious massage?

331
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,333
Oh...

332
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,000
[RHANTOLK]
Meaning, that man

333
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,375
wasn't simply touching us like
he did for perverted reasons.

334
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,083
Wow, talk about mean.

335
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,375
You really do hate
that guy, don't you?

336
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,375
I just don't accept
him as readily.

337
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,583
[laughs]

338
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,166
It appears that our break
time has been cut short.

339
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,416
[NOPHT]
No problem, here.

340
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,708
Given the shape I'm in today,

341
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,541
I could take on another
10 or 20, easily!

342
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,583
[RHANTOLK] How about a
hundred or two, instead?

343
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:04,000
[NOPHT laughs] I think that
might be a little too much.

344
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,291
[RHANTOLK]
Is that so?

345
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,291
Unfortunate.

346
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,333
[NOPHT]
Huh?

347
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,166
Get ready.

348
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,041
At this point, we must prepare
for the very worst.

349
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,291
[NOPHT]
Yep, certainly looks that way.

350
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,333
This whole thing is
the very worst.

351
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,583
In the end, I failed to do it.

352
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,333
You failed to do what?

353
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,541
Talk to her.

354
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,541
I wanted to communicate
with Chtholly again.

355
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,041
I'd have even settled
for a fight.

356
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,833
I was given yet another
chance, and I wasted it.

357
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,333
[RHANTOLK]
I see.

358
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,333
[MOGDAMAN]
All right.

359
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,291
Emergency repairs done!

360
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,000
Power up the circuits, now!

361
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,208
[WOLF SOLDIER 11B]
Roger that.

362
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,208
Powering up the circuits!

363
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,875
[SOLDIERS yelling]

364
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,083
Ready and aim!

365
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,291
Fire!

366
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,750
[SOLDIERS groan]

367
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,166
[PIGEON]
Captain!

368
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,666
Stay back.

369
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,250
We are the only ones
who can kill these beasts.

370
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,625
[BUNNY]
B-But how?

371
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,958
Don't ask.

372
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,875
Know this battlefield is
ours and kill or be killed

373
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,416
applies to us. This fight
is no longer your fight.

374
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,666
Oh god.

375
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,041
You hurt yourself protecting us.

376
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,666
Are you all right?

377
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,708
[NEPHREN]
You need to go.

378
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,083
Run.

379
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,916
[NEPHREN] I won't be able to
hold them off much longer.

380
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,291
Go, now.

381
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,375
[CREW MEMBER 11C]
Three is too damaged

382
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,833
for it to stay on the grid!

383
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,458
Two and six are fine, though!

384
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,000
Reroute the load to them!

385
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,041
Oh, for cryin' out loud, I've
only ever flown small ships!

386
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,958
Can you give a guy a break?

387
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,333
[cannon fire]

388
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,416
[WILLEM]
Chtholly.

389
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,083
I don't...

390
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,416
I don't know what to say.

391
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,958
[WILLEM2]
You don't?

392
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,791
Maybe that's because
you never really cared

393
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,333
that much about her.

394
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,291
Remember how you couldn't
stop Lillia from fighting?

395
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,958
All you did was use
another wielder

396
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,666
of Seniorious as a substitute.

397
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,500
You couldn't keep your promise
to Almaria, either.

398
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,416
So you made a different promise
with this girl instead.

399
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,916
[WILLEM whimpers]

400
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,333
[WILLEM2] You never really saw
Chtholly for who she was,

401
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,125
and you always treated
her like a child.

402
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,416
That way you'd have an
excuse to discount her.

403
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,000
[WILLEM] You're wrong!
I wanted her to--

404
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,125
[WILLEM2]
You need to face it.

405
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,125
You lied to them.

406
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,333
[WILLEM whimpers]

407
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,208
[WILLEM]
I will make you happy, Chtholly.

408
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,958
[WILLEM]
I failed.

409
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,250
I fell short of my
promise... again.

410
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,916
[crash, glass shatters]

411
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,791
[WILLEM]
And now you.

412
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,833
Yet another beast?

413
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:47,041
Welcome, then, but you
should know, right now,

414
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,916
I need someone to take
some rage out on.

415
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,375
[ELQ] There's barely anything
"you" left of you.

416
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,958
Your mind and body have been
almost entirely replaced.

417
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,791
They've been replaced by
my body and mind, naturally.

418
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,125
I'm glad you made it here

419
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,208
before you disappeared
completely, though.

420
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:10,291
Your joys, and your sorrows,
oh, and your love for someone.

421
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,833
I know you must surely still
remember those things,

422
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,625
just a little bit?
You do, do you not?

423
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,916
Yes, but only a very little bit.

424
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,916
Yay! That must be a relief.

425
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Everything's all right,
and you're still Chtholly!

426
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,625
[CHTHOLLY gasping]

427
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:45,208
Will... em...

428
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,083
[CHTHOLLY]
Final Episode: Chtholly.

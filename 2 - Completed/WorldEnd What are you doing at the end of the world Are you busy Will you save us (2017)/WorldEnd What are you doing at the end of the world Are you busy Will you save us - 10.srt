[SOLDIER 10A groaning]

00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:17,958
[NOPHT panting]

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,791
[NEPHREN]
It's been a while, Rhantolk.

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,083
I'm glad you're all right.

6
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,916
Thanks, the feeling is mutual.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,166
I have to ask, though.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,250
What's with your hair?

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,625
Uh, well...

10
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,916
And you. Who are you?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,458
The name's Willem Kmetsch, the
new fairy warehouse caretaker.

12
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,375
It's nice to meet you.

13
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,458
I see that you're
a disfeatured, too.

14
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,250
You aren't, by chance,
a troll, are you?

15
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,875
You mean Nygglatho
has a husband?!

16
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,333
No, she does not!

17
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,208
I'm human.

18
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,375
[NOPHT]
Huh?

19
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,083
[RHANTOLK]
An emnetwiht?

20
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,916
If that's a joke,
it isn't funny.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,416
Well, never mind me.

22
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,791
There's something I
wanna know about you.

23
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,291
[NOPHT gasping]

24
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,791
[laughs]

25
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,250
[NOPHT] Stop it!
That tickles so bad!

26
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,500
I knew it.

27
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,708
She's showing symptoms
of venenum poisoning.

28
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,083
Just try to suck it up.

29
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,500
[NOPHT laughing]

30
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,291
What do you think
you're doing to her?

31
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,750
Relax, it'll be fine.

32
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,583
[RHANTOLK]
How is that "fine"?

33
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,708
[laughs] Ah! My gosh--! Please!

34
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,333
I can't handle this anymore.

35
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,750
Stop! You unhand Nopht
immediately, or else!

36
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,166
Ah!

37
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,833
[NOPHT moaning]

38
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,375
Ah!

39
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,250
[RHANTOLK whimpers]

40
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,166
I sense dirty thoughts.

41
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,041
[gasps]

42
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,125
[CHTHOLLY grunts]

43
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,958
[RHANTOLK screams]

44
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,416
[WILLEM]
Feel better now?

45
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,000
My body feels so light
it's almost creepy.

46
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,500
I happen to find it unsettling

47
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,125
to have my fatigue disappear
so suddenly like that.

48
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,583
I said you'd be fine.
But how fine was she?!

49
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,333
How fine, what?

50
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,708
Let me guess, you're finding
it hard to trust me, right?

51
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,750
Of course.

52
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,583
You are an emnetwiht.

53
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,833
Others might be able to have
faith in one of the sinners

54
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,833
who destroyed the world,
but I cannot.

55
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,750
Well, I've been surrounded by
those "others" for a while, now.

56
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,541
I must be a very lucky man.

57
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,208
[RHANTOLK] I find your
nonchalance suspicious, as well.

58
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,416
Masking your evil intentions
and tricking people

59
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,375
must be a habit for you.

60
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,833
Yes, I'm grateful you helped
Chtholly survive a battle

61
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,708
in which she was
supposed to die.

62
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,083
However, your being an
emnetwiht raises a flag.

63
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,333
We have no guarantee
you are not dangerous.

64
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,208
Need I remind you
that it was your people

65
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,666
who were responsible
for spreading

66
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,666
the seventeen beasts
across the world?

67
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,708
[WILLEM]
Hm?

68
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,041
[RHANTOLK] A few days
after the beasts appeared,

69
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,291
two islands vanished
from the map.

70
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,041
By the following week,
five countries, four islands,

71
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,000
and two oceans were gone.

72
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,041
The week after that, the world
map had lost all meaning.

73
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,541
And then, before long, all
humanity was wiped out.

74
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,208
[RHANTOLK] How did the beasts
increase so rapidly in number?

75
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,083
[WILLEM] I don't know for sure,
but I've heard they

76
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,791
were originally some kind
of biological weapon.

77
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,791
Biological weapon?

78
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:46,375
Meaning, they must have used
some organism as a base.

79
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,500
What creature, exactly,
did the humans use

80
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,625
to construct the beasts?

81
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,125
Dunno.

82
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,958
Biological weapons.

83
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,708
That's why they were made.

84
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,666
Their only purpose was to fight.

85
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,375
Like us. We just fight
on the other side.

86
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,625
You don't have to know
everything about them.

87
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,333
They're archenemies who
make you suffer, that's all.

88
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,833
Isn't that right?

89
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,458
I suppose so, but I also wish
to learn the whole truth.

90
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,541
For what it's worth,
I don't mind people like you,

91
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,125
but I gotta walk away
with her so, bye.

92
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,583
I'm sorry about that.

93
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,208
She's usually such a nice girl.

94
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,916
I get her point.

95
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,583
[WILLEM] I'm gonna check
on things out there.

96
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,375
Stay on the ship for me, okay?

97
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,750
[CHTHOLLY]
What? But, I...

98
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,708
Didn't I say not
to push yourself?

99
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,500
Please just stay put.

100
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,916
Don't worry, he's in good hands.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,791
I'll be keeping an eye
on him for you.

102
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,000
Why would you keep
an eye on me?

103
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,166
Obviously, because you had
dirty thoughts about Rhan.

104
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,791
Oh, don't start!

105
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,000
[CHTHOLLY]
Rude.

106
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,250
Always treating me like a kid.

107
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,625
Who cares if Rhan has
a more mature aura.

108
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,333
--[WOLF] All right! Last one!
--[FROGGO] Finally.

109
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,500
[BIRDY]
Which way will it go?

110
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,958
[WOLF]
Now, which one is it?

111
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,291
[SOLDIERS chuckle]

112
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:03,791
Gotcha!

113
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,916
Oh, come on! Not again!

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,166
Ribbit all to hell!

115
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,750
[WOLF] Quit croakin'.
What are you, a baby?

116
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,125
A tadpole? You ain't
got legs down there?

117
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,333
[screams]

118
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,583
Get out of the doorway.

119
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,666
Oh, right, sorry about that.

120
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,500
If it isn't Madam Secretary.

121
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,250
What brings you in here,
sweetheart?

122
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,833
Wanna join us for a drink?

123
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,875
Who knew she'd just be
a disfeatured kid?

124
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,416
Kid or not, she's an
esteemed secretary.

125
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,833
She sure is.

126
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,416
She helps out our honorable
technical officer, in...

127
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,875
...more ways than one.

128
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,166
Hey, would you help us out
in more ways than one, too?

129
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,541
--Just ribbing!
--[SOLDIERS laugh]

130
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,291
You most likely do not
need to worry much

131
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,958
about Nopht and Rantolk.

132
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,500
Neither of them have
ever been the kind

133
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,875
to seriously hate someone.

134
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,625
Yeah. I get it.

135
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,041
Thank you, though.

136
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,166
[WILLEM]
You've always got my back.

137
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,250
I really do appreciate it.

138
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,750
[NEPHREN] I do so because you
might break otherwise.

139
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,666
[WILLEM]
Do I really seem that fragile?

140
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,416
Well, thanks anyway.

141
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,250
And keep looking out for
Chtholly, too, would you?

142
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,375
[NEPHREN]
Mm.

143
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
[GRICK]
You moron!

144
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,208
Do you even know
what you've done?!

145
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,958
I know that I'm a first-grade
technical officer.

146
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,916
Not to mention also being the
highest-ranking officer here.

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,833
I don't care!

148
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,916
Who died and made you the boss?!

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,083
[WILLEM] Well, look who's
as loud as ever.

150
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,541
[BOTH]
Hm?

151
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,833
[GRICK]
Willem!

152
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,083
Oh, good.

153
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,208
Do you know this man,
Second-Grade Officer?

154
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,833
[WILLEM]
Yes.

155
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,416
Okay?

156
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,375
This idiot sent an additional
excavations squad underground.

157
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,416
[MOGDAMAN]
We have to grab as many relics

158
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,708
as possible before we leave.

159
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,208
I don't believe you realize
how crucial this operation is.

160
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,375
Sending too many men
underground at once

161
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,958
is considered a bad idea.

162
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,500
Huh. That's probably
just a silly myth.

163
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,083
It's real! From what
I've been told,

164
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,125
no group of more
than seven salvagers

165
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,541
has ever returned alive!

166
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,750
There's a reason why we
work in small groups.

167
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,166
You must respect the surface!

168
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,791
They've already left, so no
point in complaining now.

169
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,208
All we can do here is
prepare for the worst.

170
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:15,291
Isn't that right, sir wise
First-Grade Technical Officer?

171
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,958
Yes, you're right
that you're right.

172
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,458
You see how bighearted a
first-grade technical officer

173
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,291
I am? Take care of
those things for me.

174
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,333
[WILLEM]
I will. Thank you, sir.

175
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,750
[sighs]

176
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,000

Shouldn't you be with your

My esteemed secretary is busy.

No idea.

We followed our orders,

which were simply
to carry it back here.

in the attack, y'know.

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,333
Yep, and I found
the other one, too.

352
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,875
[CHTHOLLY]
The "other one"?

353
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,666
[gasps]

354
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,708
[WILLEM]
That's Lapidemsibilus.

355
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,083
I'll have to take a closer look
at it once we get back home.

356
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,500
[CHTHOLLY]
You did it.

357
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,583
You really found it for me.

358
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,041
Do you still remember that night
when I tuned Seniorious?

359
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,458
Or have you forgotten?

360
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,958
I remember.

361
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,416
I also remember who Nephren
and Nopht are, and Rhantolk.

362
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,125
I know her. And I
remember Ithea, too.

363
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,541
I remember them.

364
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,625
Although I'm not sure if I
still remember everything.

365
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,041
I see.

366
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,583
Well, now that we
have the sword,

367
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,583
we don't have to worry about it.

368
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,458
[WILLEM]
Uh?

369
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,125
[gasps] What's the matter?

370
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,375
There isn't anything
wrong with it.

371
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,916
[CHTHOLLY]
Of course there isn't.

372
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,125
If there were, we'd have known

373
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,416
because Nopht would've
been struggling.

374
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
No. This sword is known
as the Kinslayer.

375
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,875
And what does the
"Kinslayer" mean?

376
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,541
[WILLEM] It specializes
in killing one's kin,

377
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,041
one's own kind.

378
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,958
You see, this is a sword that
can only be used by humans

379
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,750
to kill other humans.

380
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,541
How can that be when Nopht's
fighting beasts with it?

381
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,833
[WILLEM]
That's exactly why I thought

382
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,666
there must be something wrong.

383
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,750
This sword can only kill humans.

384
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,625
How does she kill
beasts with it? [gasps]

385
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,583
[CHTHOLLY]
Uh. Willem?

386
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,916
It can kill... only humans.

387
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,291
[RHANTOLK]
Meaning, they must have used

388
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,375
some organism as a base.

389
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,666
What creature, exactly,

390
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,666
did the humans use to
construct the beasts?

391
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,750
Oh, God.

392
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,958
[RHANTOLK] A few days after
the beasts appeared,

393
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,750
two islands vanished
from the map.

394
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,500
By the following week, five
countries, four islands,

395
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,541
and two oceans were gone.

396
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,541
The week after that, the world
map had lost all meaning.

397
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,083
And then, before long,
all humanity was wiped out.

398
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,166
[RHANTOLK] How did the beasts
increase so rapidly in number?

399
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,041
[WILLEM]
It can't be...

400
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,541
You don't have to know
everything about them.

401
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,916
They're archenemies who
make you suffer, that's all.

402
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,208
I suppose so, but I also wish
to learn the whole truth.

403
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,666
[WILLEM] That would mean the
ones making the fairies...

404
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,458
The ones making
Chtholly suffer are...

405
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,708
Correct.

406
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,041
And they're not wrong.

407
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,416
Humans did destroy the surface.

408
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,666
[WILLEM gasps]

409
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,833
What's wrong?

410
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:31,708
[crash]

411
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:32,916
[gasps]

412
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,833
Willem? Seriously,
what's the matter?

413
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,250
Talk to me!

414
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,625
[CHTHOLLY gasps]

415
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,583
[WILLEM]
You're not freaking out?

416
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,916
[CHTHOLLY] For what it's worth,
my heart is about to explode.

417
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,541
But while I don't
know what happened,

418
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,791
you're showing me your
vulnerable side,

419
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:07,208
which is rare, since you
usually act so tough.

420
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,958
It's not that complicated.

421
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,208
It's my joy plus my desire
for you to be happy.

422
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,666
I feel really lucky.

423
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,958
[WILLEM]
You...

424
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,791
Besides that, you look
like you might vanish

425
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,708
if I left you alone.

426
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:25,958
Sure, this is embarrassing, but
I'm not going to push you away.

427
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,333
[WILLEM]
You are amazing.

428
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,875
Sorry. I couldn't hear
what you just said.

429
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,708
What was that?

430
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,625
[WILLEM]
Never mind.

431
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,791
Hey, come on!

432
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,375
Please don't be like that!

433
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,583
Say it again.

434
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,583
Just one more time, please.

435
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,833
[WILLEM]
Marry me.

436
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,166
Thank you.

437
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,041
Uh! Wha--?

438
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,791
[CHTHOLLY gasps]

439
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,291
You are what I needed.

440
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,291
You gave me something
that I want to protect.

441
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,666
You gave me a home
I could return to.

442
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,875
You gave me hope.

443
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,291
You gave me a reason to live.

444
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:06,208
You helped me realize that it's
all right for me to live on.

445
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,125
So, I promise you this...

446
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,583
I swear.

447
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,958
I will make you happy, Chtholly.

448
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,833
[CHTHOLLY] I want to
stay by your side, too.

449
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:26,291
Now, we can be together forever.

450
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,791
[WORKER 10A whimpering]

451
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,916
[WORKER 10A]
No! N-No, please!

452
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,750

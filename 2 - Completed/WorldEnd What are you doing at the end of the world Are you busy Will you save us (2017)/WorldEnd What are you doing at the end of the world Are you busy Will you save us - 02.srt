00:08:59,083 --> 00:08:59,916
Tiat's on your team!

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,041
[GIRL 2G giggles]

179
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,541
Whatever works.

180
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,291
I got it!

181
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:10,458
[ALMITA laughs]
Stop rolling, ball!

182
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,541
[gasps]

183
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,166
[WILLEM]
Almita!

184
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,791
[WILLEM]
Hey!

185
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,625
Almita! Are you all right?

186
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,708
[ALMITA]
Yeah. I think so.

187
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,625
Ouchie.

188
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,125
[gasps]

189
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,833
I fell down hard!

190
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:29,875
[laughs]

191
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,708
Stay still. You're bleeding.

192
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,041
[ALMITA]
I'm fine, don't worry.

193
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,458
[COLLON]
Almita! Get the dumb ball!

194
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,000
It's right over there!

195
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,208
[gasps]

196
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,583
[COLLON laughs]
Hurry up!

197
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,625
You girls are...

198
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,208
You appear to have something
you'd like to share with me.

199
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,333
I didn't realize it
until earlier today.

200
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,000
These children.

201
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,291
They're not at all concerned
about their lives.

202
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,791
[NYGGLATHO]
They're not.

203
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,625
I know it can be unnerving
how indifferent they are.

204
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,416
[WILLEM]
It's not normal.

205
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,541
Who and what are these girls?

206
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,375
I get why you ask, but, to be
honest, I'd rather not answer.

207
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,166
Are you sure you wanna
know the truth?

208
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,500
Once you know, your attitude
towards them will change,

209
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,291
and you won't be able
to help yourself.

210
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,708
I just...

211
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,250
I don't want that change in you
to hurt their feelings.

212
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,583
The past few days, you've acted
like a very nice young man.

213
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,375
While, at first, I found that
side of you a little creepy,

214
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,625
now, I'm thankful for how kind
and generous you've been.

215
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,000
If it's at all possible,

216
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,083
I'd like things to stay this
way for a while longer.

217
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,291
[sighs]

218
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,958
I want to know.

219
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:12,416
[NYGGLATHO] I assume you're
already aware of the 17 beasts?

220
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,958
[WILLEM] Yes, they were created
500 years ago by foolish humans.

221
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,500
I mean, emnetwihts.

222
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,250
Awfully self-deprecating,
aren't we?

223
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,333
Of course, not long
after their creation,

224
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,375
the beasts wiped out all
life on the surface,

225
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,250
including the emnetwihts.

226
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,333
That wasn't enough
for the beasts, though.

227
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,875
Our skies are in constant
jeopardy of their next attack.

228
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,291
Which begs the question,

229
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:41,375
how do we defend
ourselves against them?

230
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,791
The answer lies
beyond this door.

231
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,750
[door creaks]

232
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:54,208
[gasps] Are those... carillons?

233
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,500
[NYGGLATHO] We call them
"dug weapons" now.

234
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,791
These instruments are our only
means of fighting the 17 beasts.

235
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,750
[WILLEM]
Insania.

236
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,208
Ignareo.

237
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,750
Percival.

238
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,333
[WILLEM]
As I recall,

239
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,458
Carillons were special.

240
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,916
So special, in fact,
that only chosen emnetwiht

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,291
braves could wield them.

242
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,791
[NYGGLATHO]
Correct.

243
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,708
[WILLEM] So, with the
emnetwihts gone now,

244
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,416
how are they still working?

245
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,333
Who's using them to fight?

246
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,708
Well, surely, you already know.

247
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,583
[WILLEM]
But how...?

248
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,000
[NYGGLATHO]
The girls are leprechauns.

249
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,375
Fairies who have imitated
emnetwihts since ancient times.

250
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,833
That means they have the ability
to use emnetwiht weapons.

251
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,250
The difference?

252
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,333
Their bodies were created
to be expended in battle.

253
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,083
ecause of that, they have
no fear of death.

254
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,000
You wanted to know
what they were.

255
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,583
You have your answer.

256
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,958
I hope you can handle it.

257
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,333
I'll be fine.

258
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,916
So those girls are your
partners, now?

259
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,208
Huh.

260
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,000
[bell tolls]

261
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,416
Pannibal, you're going too fast!

262
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,083
[GIRLS chattering]

263
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,458
[GIRL 2I]
Wait!

264
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,583
[GIRLS laughing]

265
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,333
Hello, Nephren. All alone?

266
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,416
Where are Chtholly and Ithea?

267
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,750
They both went out.

268
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,958
[gasps]

269
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,000
[WILLEM]
They both went out,

270
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,041
and did not return
until several days later.

271
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,375
[WILLEM] Venenum output
is inversely proportional

272
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,958
to a spell caster's life force.

273
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,333
The more they want to live,
the lower the output.

274
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,333
For those who care
nothing about their lives,

275
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,625
the output rises drastically.

276
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,166
[WILLEM]
Such power cannot be contained

277
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,958
and quickly grows out of control
causing a massive explosion.

278
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,833
Both spell caster and
enemy will be obliterated,

279
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:10,250
leaving the dug weapon as
the lone survivor of the blast.

280
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,750
[WILLEM]
Yes.

281
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,583
I'm sure those girls
make excellent weapons.

282
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,416
If it isn't Officer Willem.

283
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,208
Long time no see!

284
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,416
Hey, are you two all right?

285
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,541
What?! Yeah, sure, I'm fine!

286
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,750
And she's...

287
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,875
Well, she's napping
'cause she's worn out.

288
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,375
That's a relief.

289
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,541
[ITHEA] Fancy running
into you here, though.

290
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,625
Out on a walk?

291
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,083
[WILLEM]
Nygglatho told me you were back,

292
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,541
so I'm here to pick you up.

293
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:54,125
[ITHEA] Wait, does that
mean that you, um...

294
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,916
Knew that you were
away fighting?

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,541
Seventeen beasts and all that.

296
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,375
[ITHEA laughs]
I can't believe it!

297
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,125
Talk about embarrassing.

298
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,958
[LIMESKIN]
You must be who I'm looking for.

299
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,208
Technical Officer Willem,
that correct?

300
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,375
Yes.

301
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,458
And who exactly are you?

302
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,375
[LIMESKIN] I'm here to
give you their weapons.

303
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,833
Return them to
the vault immediately.

304
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,750
[WILLEM] These are Seniorious
and Valgulious, right?

305
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,041
[ITHEA] Wow! You're
good at knowing stuff.

306
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,750
Seniorious is the one
Chtholly's compatible with.

307
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,666
And I've got Valgulious.

308
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,416
Seriously, you're
extremely well informed.

309
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,000
I bet you checked our equipment
list or something like that.

310
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,583
Actually, no.

311
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,041
They just happen to be swords
I'm familiar with, that's all.

312
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,500
That's all, huh?
Very interesting.

313
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,541
Fess up. How much
do you really know?

314
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,833
[WILLEM]
Not much.

315
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,583
I know that you're fairies.

316
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,625
And you fight with dug weapons
to protect the world.

317
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,875
I suppose that's about it.

318
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,916
[ITHEA] Did the idea of
weapons that look like us

319
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,750
bother you at all?

320
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:21,041
I mean, we're basically
disposable lives.

321
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:25,833
Not to mention, we use relics of
those awful emnetwihts.

322
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,583
[ITHEA]
What's up?

323
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,083
[WILLEM]
A long time ago,

324
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,208
I knew someone in a
similar situation.

325
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,500
And I owe that someone a
great deal for many things.

326
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,583
So after hearing your story,

327
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,250
I couldn't just walk away.

328
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,708
Now, you know.

329
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,541
Oh, boy!

330
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,458
A sudden mention of your past!

331
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,875
Two people having a
heart-to-heart all alone!

332
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,750
Wait, are you hitting on
and or flirting with me?

333
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,958
All alone?

334
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,833
Are you forgetting about
the girl on my back?

335
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,708
[ITHEA] Course not!
Because this is the start

336
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,416
of a love triangle filled with
passion, hate, and jealousy.

337
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,791
[WILLEM] Keep it down.
You're gonna wake her up.

338
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,916
[ITHEA]
Wow, what a tease.

339
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,000
[gasps]

340
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,166
Willem!

341
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,875
What do you think
you're doing in here?

342
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,833
I think I'm taking
care of a patient.

343
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,958
Well, who's your patient?

344
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,833
[gasping]

345
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,458
Try not to push yourself.

346
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,375
You do still have a fever.

347
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,208
I'm your caretaker, remember.

348
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,458
So, let me take care.

349
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,333
I don't need you,
a caretaker or not.

350
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:42,083
Besides, what you do for me
doesn't really matter anyway.

351
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,000
I appreciate it, but I
don't have much time left.

352
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,208
"Time left"?

353
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,083
What does that mean?

354
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,583
[CHTHOLLY]
Hey...

355
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,208
What is it?

356
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,416
Just um, let's say...

357
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,583
...if I were gonna die in five
days, like hypothetically,

358
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,166
do you think you'd be
a little nicer to me?

359
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,750
What are you talking about?

360
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,208
[CHTHOLLY]
In five days, Island Fifteen

361
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,875
will come under a powerful
timere attack.

362
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,291
[WILLEM]
One of the 17 beasts?

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,208
[CHTHOLLY]
None of the beasts can fly.

364
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,291
But a timere can release parts
of its body into the air,

365
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,291
allowing those parts to
travel all the way up

366
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,791
to the sky islands.

367
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,291
How do you know for
sure it will be five days?

368
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,583
We can predict
their attacks, now.

369
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,833
We've fought for centuries.
I guess we're bound to evolve.

370
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,000
But it certainly
took us long enough!

371
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,333
Apparently, the incoming
timere can't be fought

372
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,875
using usual military methods.

373
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,791
However, a fairy wielding
a dug weapon...

374
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,875
...can take it out
single-handedly.

375
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,333
The only cost would
be your life.

376
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,750
[CHTHOLLY]
That's pretty much it.

377
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,208
If I use my power and
Seniorious to blow myself up,

378
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,125
I'll just barely be able
to destroy the thing.

379
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,291
How lucky is that, right?

380
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,333
Nobody else will have to die.

381
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,583
Okay, so it's not hypothetical.

382
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:11,041
Does that maybe make you feel
like granting me a final wish?

383
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,541
[WILLEM]
Depends on what it is.

384
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,125
Well, I uh...

385
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,916
Um.

386
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,916
Like for example.

387
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,541
What if I...

388
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,833
[gasps]

389
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,166
A kiss?

390
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,208
What if I asked to kiss you?

391
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,041
Just once.

392
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
[WILLEM exhales]

393
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,375
[footsteps]

394
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,958
After all that talk about
only having five days left,

395
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,000
that's the kind of
crap you ask me for?

396
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,666
[gasps] So what!

397
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,166
Ah!

398
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,416
Ow.

399
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,666
You're a kid.

400
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,458
Why are you trying to be
something you're not?

401
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,000
Excuse me?!

402
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,875
What's wrong with wanting to
have sweet memories before I go?

403
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,708
I'm about to die here!

404
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,333
But first, I wanna matter!

405
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,791
I wanna be kept alive
in someone else's heart!

406
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,541
Just to be connected.

407
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,541
Tell me! What's wrong with that?

408
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,833
Am I not allowed anything?

409
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,333
I don't want you to sell
yourself short, that's all.

410
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,416
You don't have to settle for
who's standing in front of you.

411
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,583
You should buy me while
I'm selling myself short.

412
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,833
Seriously, it's a basic
rule for shopping smart.

413
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,083
Just go!

414
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,666
If you won't kiss me,
don't try to help!

415
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,458
I'm not even crying!

416
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,750
Well, you sound like
you're crying.

417
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,375
[CHTHOLLY]
You're crying!

418
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,625
Good grief.

419
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,500
Look, I want you to turn
on your belly for a sec.

420
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,750
[CHTHOLLY]
I can't hear you.

421
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,458
[WILLEM] Will you please
stop being difficult?

422
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,625
[CHTHOLLY]
I said I can't hear you!

423
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,458
Oh, come on.

424
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,041
Could you be any more stubborn?

425
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,541
[gasps]

426
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,458
[CHTHOLLY]
What... What was that?

427
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,125
[CHTHOLLY]
Um, I didn't um...

428
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,791
I really didn't feel that one.

429
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,041
[gasping]

430
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,666
[whimpers]

431
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,083
[WILLEM]
I knew it.

432
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:16,375
You're showing typical symptoms
of venenum poisoning.

433
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,041
You generated too
much which then

434
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,625
gave you a real nasty
case of muscular fever.

435
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,500
This isn't pleasant,
but it helps.

436
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,833
[CHTHOLLY]
Ow! By not pleasant,

437
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,208
you mean it feels like fire?!

438
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,875
It'll be better in a little bit.

439
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,250
[groans] A little bit?

440
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,083
I'm gonna feel like this
forever, aren't I?

441
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,791
[CHTHOLLY groaning]

442
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,000
[CHTHOLLY gasps]

443
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,791
[CHTHOLLY screams]

444
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,666
Not to worry. You just
let me take care of this.

445
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:23,250
[LILA] The mightiest brave is
here with the mightiest sword.

446
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,250
There's nothing
else for you to do.

447
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,541
[WILLEM]
No.

448
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,750
I can't just walk away.

449
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,791

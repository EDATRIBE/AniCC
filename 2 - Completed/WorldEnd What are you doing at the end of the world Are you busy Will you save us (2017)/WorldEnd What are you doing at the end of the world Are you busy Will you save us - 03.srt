This place is a disaster.

00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,041
It's ridiculous...

6
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,416
I doubt this room's
ever been cleaned up.

7
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Maybe no one uses it?

It's Ren.

14
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,000
You can just call me Ren.

15
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,250
[WILLEM] Well, thanks
for the coffee, Ren.

16
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,458
May I ask you what you're
doing here so late?

17
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,166
I've been looking for your
sortie records, actually.

18
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,041
Those are in the junk room?

19
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,708
Need some help?

20
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,375
Sure, if you don't mind.

21
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,166
After that, I want to find
the files on timeres.

22
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,416
I need to know sortie
frequency and timing,

23
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,125
any strength differentials,
overall losses,

24
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,416
that sort of thing. The more
I can learn, the better.

25
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,250
[NEPHREN] Roger. You're asking
a lot, but I'll do it.

26
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,541
[WILLEM] Great. Think we can
get it done by morning?

27
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,583

Mm.

like hypothetically,

32
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,791
do you think you'd be
a little nicer to me?

00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,500
A kiss?

34
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,458
What if I asked to kiss you?

35
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,750
Just once.

36
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,250
That was a dream.

37
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,416
There's no way I could've
said that to him!

I'm fine!

Good. You sound fine.

47

I bet that's a relief.

48
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,375
Usually after a battle, you
seem to be in a lot of pain.

49
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,666
Well, that's because...

50
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,083
Wait, I don't feel as bad today.

51
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,250
Of course not!

You've got heart and spirit!

Wait, last night.

know where he is?

Yes, good morning.

66
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,041
So, you spent the
whole night together.

67
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,541
And what were you doing?

68
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,125
Nothing important.

Trying to find a way for you to
avoid opening the Fairy Gate.

We just didn't want you
to die, that's all.

You don't understand, do you?

72
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,875
We have to be the ones to fight

73
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,583
because it's the only
way to take them out.

74
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,333
[WILLEM]
Are you positive about that?

Huh?

I'm positive we don't
have a choice!

And we certainly don't
need your pity!

you're feeling better.

Chtholly.

Do you think you're ready
to give up your life

in order to secure a future
for the rest of these kids?

Listen to me.
These carillons,

105
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,250
that is to say dug weapons,

106
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,166
they're powerful swords, yes,
but they do not gain potency

107
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,958
from the wielder's
output of venenum.

108
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,666
What? You're not serious.

Oh, but I am.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,666
These weapons use
the enemy's own force

111
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,166
against them as soon
as contact is made.

112
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,541
The stronger the opponent,
the more lethal the sword.

00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,916

There has to be a better way
to battle these beasts

doing, hasn't there?

less self-destruction nonsense.

understand about us?

[WILLEM] You fight without
knowing the basics,

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,875
which means you can only swing
your sword with brute force.

who doesn't understand.

your fighting style

enough to win.

Will you, listen to me?!

[CHTHOLLY]
No!

136
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,833
[WILLEM] I can explain to
you how the dug weapons

137
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,708
are actually meant to work!

[CHTHOLLY]
He's wrong!

139
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,166
[WILLEM] I want you to learn
the proper way to fight,

140
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,208
and to wield Seniorious!

[WILLEM]
Your movements are sharp.

146
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,875
I like your instincts, too.

147
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,166
And your venenum flow
is pretty special.

This is a relief.

149

You're plenty strong.

150
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:05,750
What's more, you will be
able to get stronger.

Just to confirm.

158
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,500
In three days at exactly
eight o'clock,

159
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,500
we will dispatch three
of our wielders,

160

along with their individual
dug weapons,

161
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,000
from the port at
Island Sixty-Eight.

162
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,583
The fairy that wields Seniorious
will be in attendance

163
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,458
with the understanding that...

164
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,875
[NYGGLATHO]
That during this operation,

165
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,916
it will be her responsibility
to open the Fairy Gate.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,708
Yes, we are confirmed.

[NYGGLATHO sighs] Why must it
always be one of our girls

168
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,625
to make the sacrifice?

169
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,375
They die before ever
getting the chance

170
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:01,750
to experience what life
truly has to offer.

172
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,250
I hate this! I hate it!

to be this way?!

Why didn't you knock?

176

It's an emergency.

177
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,166
A bad one.
Willem's going to die!

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,541
[EBONCANDLE]
You managed to defeat me?

179
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:42,166
Your strength is impressive,
even for a human.

180
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,916
However, you must know
all those spells you cast

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,625
will return to torment
you as curses.

182
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,875
[EBONCANDLE] I shall now slumber
for a century.

183
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,541
Sadly, I've not been
blessed with enough time

184
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,375
to watch you expire.

185
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,958
[WILLEM]
Go, then, demon.

186
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,333
Enjoy your sleep.

187
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,458
Let me die in peace.

188
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:09,583
[EBONCANDLE laughs]
As you wish, human brave.

189
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,291
Farewell.

190
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,125
[WILLEM] I've always known I
would be fated to this end.

191
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,541
May it not be in vain.

192
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,666
Lillia, I'm sorry.

193
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,291
Souwong, please forgive me.

194
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,375
[WILLEM]
I leave the rest to you, now.

195
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:44,000
[WILLEM]
Almaria, I truly am sorry.

196
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,208
A dream.

197
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,833
Yes, and a nightmare
by the looks of it.

198
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,125
What happened to you?

199
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,708
Your bones are all broken,

200
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,250
and your organs are
barely functional.

201
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,875
In fact, your muscles
are so frail,

202
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,791
I could have easily
bitten them off.

203
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,208
Not as satisfying as
you'd hoped?

204
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,208
This isn't a joke,
I'm seriously worried!

205
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:17,541
I don't know what happened, but
how can you live in this state?

206
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,958
I call them my battle scars.

207
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,250
[NYGGLATHO]
From before we ever met?

208
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,458
Yes. It wasn't very
easy being me.

209
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,166
[sighs] Try to get some rest.

210
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,125
And no getting out
of bed, mister.

211
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,375
[WILLEM grunts]

212
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,541
Now this story happened
a long time ago.

213
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,375
In those days,
I was on the surface

214
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,208
helping a group of salvagers
find anything to sell.

215
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,541
While exploring one day,
we came across

216
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,625
what appeared to be a
frozen underground lake.

217
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,541
[NYGGLATHO] That's where we
found him, frozen in ice.

218
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,583
[NYGGLATHO] Our investigation
revealed that he'd been placed

219
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,666
under a petrification curse.
We decided it would be best

220
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,958
to take him back to
the sky islands with us.

221
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,416
[WILLEM groaning]

222
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,083
[NYGGLATHO] When he woke up,
he was in a panic.

223
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,250
It didn't help that we couldn't
communicate with each other.

224
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,250
But, thankfully, he was
wearing a babel talisman.

225
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,875
That's what eventually solved
our communication dilemma.

226
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,958
Without it, we may never have
learned who he really was.

227
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,625
The human race had alienated
all the other races

228
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,541
and were forced to fight alone.

229
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,791
They had been wiped out, along
with the rest of surface life.

230
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,250
But as luck would have it,

231
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,291
the wretched race we call
emnetwihts had one survivor.

232
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,958
Willem Kmetsch.

233
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,500
[NYGGLATHO] I know how
this must make you feel.

234
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,791
I just don't want it
to make you fear him.

235
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,333
I don't want you
to hate him, either.

00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,208

different from us.

the wrong way.

What am I gonna do
with them? Silly girls.

256

[ITHEA] Ah! Well, that sure
made things quieter.

too. I wasn't kidding.

[ITHEA laughs]
Oh, no, don't you worry.

260
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,708
All I wanted is to ask that
half-dead man who's apparently

261
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,833
the last living
emnetwiht a question.

262
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,166
Go ahead. What is it?

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,041
Well, I'm wondering why
a great emnetwiht,

264
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,500
why you would go so far for us.

265
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,833
You risked your life for
basically no reason.

00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,083
I mean...

267
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,041
That's totally disgusting.

268
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,333
Right. I guess so?

269
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,250
Isn't it only natural to wanna
be nice to cute kids, though?

270
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,708
Especially if they're girls?

271
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,750
Cute is relative, and
we're all girls here,

272
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,166
gender should have
nothing to do with

273
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,250
whether or not you're kind.

00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,500
I didn't mean to offend,
it's my opinion.

275
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,416
I just think girls are cuter.

276
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,208
It reflects the way
they want to be loved.

277
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,083
They adorably wish to be adored.

278
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,708
Boys are cute too,
just in a smellier way.

279
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,833
And adorable applies to us?

280
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,791
Come on, as a race,
you're generally all born

281
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,000
in this form, right?

282
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,625
Can't be this cute for nothing.

283
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,250
So you're telling me
everyone in my race

284
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,208
is really desperate
for attention?

285
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,125
How funny, this coming
from someone

286
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,458
who's practically obsessed
with little girls.

287
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,416
Oh! Of course! I get it!

288
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,666
No, I don't think you do!

There's just no way.

I refuse to believe he's right.

It seems you're the one
who doesn't understand.

I'm the man who knows
your fighting style

296
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,833

enough to win.

Terrified.

00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,666
[CHTHOLLY] It took what
seemed like an eternity

303

Proud warriors will always have
a safe place here with us,

00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,750
should they need to
escape their winds.

That's good to know.

I don't think so.

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,208
Besides, it's probably
too late to say

317
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,708
I'm afraid of dying, isn't it?

318
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,666
[CHTHOLLY] Technical Officer
Willem showed me a new

319
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,791
fighting style, different from
anything I've ever seen.

320
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,291
And I can't...

321
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,875
I can't accept what he says!

322
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,875
Because that would mean that the
older fairies all died in vain!

323
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:50,791
I can't...

324
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,750
It struck fear in you?

325
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,583
Seems so...

326
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,916
I see! Of course.

327
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,708
Don't be concerned,
that man is simply

328
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,291
trying to fight the wind
that blows within you.

329
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,875
The wind?

330
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,583
I've heard some warriors refer
to their wind as their resolve.

331
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,291
But I suppose resignation is an
acceptable equivalent, too.

332
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,250
Do you think my doubts mean
I lack a warrior's resolve?

333
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,250
I don't.

334
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,750
Resignation does
not have to mean

335
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,916
you lack anything, Chtholly.

336
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,083
No matter the word, you've
cast aside what others

337
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,208
consider precious in order
to achieve a goal.

338
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,791
You're a warrior,

339
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,541
and all warriors have
wind in their hearts.

340
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,791
On their aimless path, it
gives them some direction.

341
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,791
Once the battle ends,
their souls remain pure

342
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,916
and are able to find
the rest they so deserve.

343
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,291
Thanks, Officer.

344
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,458
But, I um...

345
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,250
I didn't understand any of that.

346
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,500
Is that so?

347
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,083
Can I...

348
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,083
I'd like to make a confession,
even if it gets me in trouble.

349
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,458
The thing is...

350
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:58,583
Well, I've never actually
wanted to be a warrior.

351
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:03,791
[LIMESKIN chuckles]

352
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,916
You're looking good, Seniorious.

353
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,458
Way to hang in there.

354
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,958
[WILLEM] Ooh. The runaway
girl hath returned.

355
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,041
I just went out for a stroll.

356
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,291
What are you doing?

357
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,916
[WILLEM] A little maintenance
on your partner.

358
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,583
Did it cross your mind
to ask the wielder

359
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,291
for permission first?

360
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,250
[CHTHOLLY]
A beautiful performance.

361
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,916
[WILLEM]
Heh. Performance, huh?

362
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,333
I've never seen these lights.
What are they?

363
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,291
These are shining talismans.

364
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,000
It's how carillons are made.

365
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,916
Various shining talismans
join together

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,541
and form the shape of a sword.

367
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,333
Huh.

368
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,666
Then all these lights,

369
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,250
they're from wishes people
have made, aren't they?

370
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,416
The talisman that you
flicked just then?

371
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,458
It was created to help you
avoid burning your tongue

372
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,750
on a hot beverage.

373
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,125
Uh?

374
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,125
The one next to it let's you
know which way is north,

375
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,875
even if you're in a place that
you've never been before.

376
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,416
And the lights there
directly above it

377
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,250
can prevent nightmares
when you have a cold.

378
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,833
One can help you
imitate cat meows--

379
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,583
This is Seniorious. It's a
legendary weapon, right?

380
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,375
Apparently, when you connect
different talismans using magic,

381
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,125
it causes a complex reaction
that gives them entirely new

382
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,416
and captivating
effects like this.

383
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,666
[CHTHOLLY]
I guess I thought

384
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,333
since it's a
legendary holy sword

385
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,791
that it would have a more
extraordinary origin.

386
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,583
[WILLEM]
Sorry to disappoint.

387
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:56,750
[CHTHOLLY] So, I spoke with
First-Grade Officer Limeskin.

388
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,500
He said he would
leave it up to me,

389
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,208
that I can make my own decision.

390
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,041
I don't have to open the Fairy
Gate if I don't want to.

391
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,958
He'd stake the
island's fate on it.

392
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,541
He trusts my potential
as well as resolve.

393
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,208
That's wonderful.

394
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,166
So I can grow stronger,
and you really believe that?

395
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,083
I don't just believe it.
I can make it happen.

396
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,375
[gasps]

397
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,666
All right, I'll take you
up on it, but first...

398
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,583
Yes, what?

399
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,500
You might wanna know,

400
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,375
I actually don't
want to be strong!

401
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,625
No, that's not how it should go.

402
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,125
You're supposed to
notice my affection

403
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,833
and accept my offer
while crying.

404
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,875
Heh! Sorry, but I'm being
as accepting as I can.

405
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,708
Because you can't take a hint.

406
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,916
Stupid.

407
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,083
Fine then, if you manage
to come back alive.

408
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,000
I'll grant you one wish,
anything you want.

409
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,500
[gasps]

410
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,750
Wait, you can't ask me to marry
you or that kind of crap.

411
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,208
But you said anything!

412
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,208
You have to pick something
that's grounded in reality.

413
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,375
[CHTHOLLY grumbles]

414
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,416
[gasps] Sweets.

415
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,958
Uh?

416
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,500
[CHTHOLLY] The other day you
made sweets for the little ones,

417
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,833
remember? That's what I want.

418
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,708
Can you make butter cake, maybe?

419
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,125
[WILLEM gasping]

420
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,291
[ALMARIA] I'll feed you
so much of that cake,

421
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,541
you're bound to get heartburn.

422
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,333
A girl I used to know,
an older fairy,

423
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,833
whenever she returned from a
battle she'd devour butter cake

424
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,750
like her life genuinely
depended on it.

425
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,875
But they don't offer it on the
menu in the mess hall anymore.

426
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,708
I've never been able
to imitate her.

427
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,208
That's what I want.

428
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,416
Please.

429
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,416
Of all the bizarre things...

430
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,625
Willem?

431
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,416
Don't worry. I'm fine.

432
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,458
[WILLEM]
And you're on.

433
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,625
I'll feed you enough
to give you heartburn.

434
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,125
[WILLEM]
It's a deal.

435
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,583
Now, you just have
to come back alive.

436
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,750
[CHTHOLLY]
You got it.

437
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,541
[GRICK]
What's goin' on?

438
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,250
You didn't want to meet
me all the way here

439
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,083
for lunch for no reason.

440
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,375
I tuned their swords
as much as I could,

441
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,875
and I taught them
everything I know.

442
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,291
They should be ready.

443
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,416
Well, then, why aren't you
out there seeing them off?

444
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,333
I don't know why, but
it's not like it's going to

445
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,125
improve their
chances of victory.

446
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,833
[GRICK]
Hey, You never know.

447
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,458
A heart full of faith could make
way for a mysterious power!

448
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,541
[WILLEM]
No, it won't.

449
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,250
We all wish it could,
but it won't.

450
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,833
[GRICK] My friend,
you are far too cynical.

451
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,250
[WILLEM laughs]

452
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,958
[CHTHOLLY] All right.
It looks like we're off!

453
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,250
[WILLEM]
Oh, yeah.

454
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,458
Do you know any shops that
sell butter and flour?

455
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,041
Not too pricey.

456
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,166
[WILLEM]
Next Episode: dice in pot.

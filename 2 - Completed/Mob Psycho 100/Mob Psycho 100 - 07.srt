1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,916
[RITSU]
Hm? What's that?

2
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,125
[NARRATOR]
At the same time that Ritsu

3
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,708
was mistaking Dimple
for some sort of

4
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,375
creepy-looking balloon...

5
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,000
...the rumors going
around about Mob,

6
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,000
who had bested
Hanazawa, shadow leader

7
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,583
of Black Vinegar Middle
School, started to take on

8
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,708
a life of their own.

9
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,666
"White T Poison"...

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,208
This was the title given to Mob,

11
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,416
whose identity had
yet to be revealed.

12
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,166
[FUJI]
White T Poison...

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,708
I'll be the one to defeat him!

14
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,375
[MISO GANG gasps]

15
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,958
I'm gonna defeat this Poison guy

16
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,583
and make him admit
that I'm the best.

17
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,583
So the next target
is Salt Middle School.

18
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,541
White T Poison will
make excellent prey.

19
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,833
This is my chance to shine.

20
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,000
[NARRATOR]
And so, the rumor mill continued

21
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,666
churning out of control.

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,416
The fierce battle to see
who would take down

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,666
White T Poison was
about to begin.

24
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,916
Whew! Thanks for the help!

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,791
Somehow I managed
to make it back

26
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,083
from the particle
level all by myself.

27
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,875
But my spiritual
energy was way less

28
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,416
than it used to be.

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,833
So I couldn't get back
into the house anymore.

30
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,083
It appears that
low-level spirits

31
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,541
can't go anywhere
near this place

32
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,666
simply because
Shigeo lives here.

33
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,250
[RITSU]
What is that?

34
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,541
Some kinda talking
jellyfish-looking thing?

35
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,416
I know what needs to be done.

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,916
[DIMPLE]
Huh? Wanna shake hands?

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,166
[RITSU]
I have to exorcise it!

38
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,958
[DIMPLE]
Whoa, wait a second!

39
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,625
Stop kneeing me
in the face already!

40
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,875
I'm not a threat!
I'm Shigeo's friend!

41
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:17,916
You're what?

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,458
You could even
call me his mentor.

43
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,916
I'll let you off
the hook this time,

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,916
because you were obviously
confused and panicked.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,541
But, that aside...

46
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,375
I've got a proposition.

47
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,083
How about you and I team up?

48
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,000
No thanks.

49
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,500
Hey, let's not be so hasty.

50
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,416
Wait a second, just hear me out.

51
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,333
You've only recently awakened
your psychic powers, right?

52
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,916
[RITSU gasps]
What? I have psychic powers now?

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,583
The fact that you
can see me is proof

54
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,875
of your newfound abilities.

55
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,041
The name's Dimple.

56
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,916
I'm what most people
would call a ghost.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,958
So are my psychic powers
only strong enough

58
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,000
to allow me to see
ghosts like you?

59
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,708
[DIMPLE]
Well, I see you haven't realized

60
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,541
how to use them, yet.

61
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,125
Go ahead.

62
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,041
You should be able to do that
now, just like your brother.

63
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,916
[RITSU]
I shouldn't get my hopes up.

64
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,958
[DIMPLE]
Hm? What's the matter?

65
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:10,333
[RITSU] Doing anything like
this is way out of my reach.

66
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,416
[DIMPLE]
What's with him?

67
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,375
Does he have a
complex or something?

68
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,875
Well, that's understandable,

69
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,083
given who his
brother is and all.

70
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:22,333
[RITSU]
It... It's... It's not...

71
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,125
I can't do it!

72
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,041
Dimple!

73
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,125
It's not bending!

74
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,958
Hey, relax, kid.

75
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,541
[RITSU]
What the--?

76
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,291
Did I do that?

77
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,416
[DIMPLE]
Join me, little Ritsu...

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,208
Join me and I'll help you
surpass your brother.

79
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,458
[RITSU gasps]

80
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:48,166
[RITSU]
Surpass... my brother?

81
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,833
Is that even possible?

82
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,000
[RITSU] I can be more
powerful... than Shige?

83
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,250
Sure you can if you'll
let me use your body.

84
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,458
Ritsu's not eating with us?

85
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,583
I guess he's not hungry.

86
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,375
I wonder what could
be wrong with him.

87
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,125
Is he upset about something?

88
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,041
[MOB'S MOM]
No...

89
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,958
In fact, he seems oddly happy.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,208
[RITSU] How do I get
to the point where I can

91
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,208
use my powers freely?

92
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,666
It's better to
actually try them out,

93
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,416
rather than explain,
little Ritsu.

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,791
Stop calling me that.

95
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,333
Fine, then. Plain
old Ritsu it is.

96
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,875
Now, how 'bout you
close your eyes,

97
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,875
and relax your entire body.

98
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,833
[DIMPLE] Prepare for
possession, you fool!

99
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,666
Now your body's mine
for the taking!

100
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,750
[DIMPLE]
Heh, heh!

101
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,958
What?!

102
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,083
I've possessed him,
but I can't control him?

103
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,666
Hey, Dimple. Where'd you go?

104
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,125
[DIMPLE] It's because
my spiritual powers

105
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,666
have become so weak... Damn it!

106
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,958
[shcool bell rings]

107
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,083
[STUDENT 7A]
I heard the student council

108
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,666
took care of the problem.

109
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,416
[STUDENT 7B] You mean with
the pervy gang leader?

110
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,875
[STUDENT 7C]
Wow, way to go.

111
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,791
[STUDENT 7D] They're the
heroes of the school.

112
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,375
[SHINJI]
Yamazaki, Year 2, Class 4.

113
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,958
I'd like a word with you.

114
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,833
Huh? What do you want?

115
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,791
[SHINJI]
Your coat. It isn't buttoned.

116
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,833
[YAMAZAKI]
So what? Buzz off.

117
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,875
I can do it.

118
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,625
Now, I can use psychic
powers, Dimple.

119
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,166
[DIMPLE]
That's because I'm helping

120
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,708
to regulate their output.

121
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,583
But rest assured,
these abilities

122
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,416
have always been
there, lying dormant.

123
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,833
And it's my guess
that the reason

124
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,958
they came out now is
due to some radical

125
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,875
change in your emotional state.

126
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,916
Have you endured some
"way-above-average"

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,750
stress levels lately?

128
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,458
Like pooping your
pants in public,

129
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:44,041
or getting caught peeking
into the girls' locker room?

130
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,458
What kind of a question is that?

131
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,791
I'd never do those things.

132
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:47,875
I was joking, Ritsu.

133
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,166
Don't be so damn serious. Oh...

134
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,208
That's right.

135
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,458
You're an honor
student, aren't ya?

136
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,958
Then, what is it?
Did you do something bad?

137
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,166
[SHINJI]
A rumor's going around that

138
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,583
you're stealing the
girls' gym clothes.

139
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,833
Huh? The hell are
you talkin' about?

140
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,333
[SHINJI] The student council
did some investigating.

141
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,333
And what'd we find
out, Kageyama?

142
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,625
We discovered some of
the girl's gym clothes

143
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,250
tucked away and
hidden in your bag.

144
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,916
What?! You guys are lyin'!

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,583
[SHINJI]
Deny it if you want,

146
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,208
but that may not
go so well for you.

147
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,416
You see, the school's
been very strict

148
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,166
with deviants lately.

149
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,541
[SHINJI] But I'm here to
offer you a way out of this.

150
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,666
Simply admit Onigawara
ordered you to do these things.

151
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,791
If you comply, you're
merely another victim.

152
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,291
Sound good? Now button up.

153
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,083
[NARRATOR] Using these
and other similar methods,

154
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,750
the whole school was cleaned up,

155
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,625
turning it into the optimal
environment for academics.

156
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,708
However, because
of the considerably

157
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,000
immoral strategy that
was used upon certain

158
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,625
delinquent students to
accomplish this outcome,

159
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,666
a deep scar would
be forever engraved

160
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,666
on their lives.

161
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,291
And the two student
council members

162
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,916
saddled with this task had
to live with that burden.

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,833
So they either became
drunk with power,

164
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,666
feeling a delusional sense
of accomplishment,

165
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,208
or they suffered greatly.

166
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,916
[DIMPLE]
Whoa!

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,833
Ritsu, your power's
grown even more!

168
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,375
[RITSU]
I see, corruption and guilt...

169
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,958
Those are the things
that become fuel

170
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,000
for my powers.

171
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,041
Whatever you're doing,
it is working!

172
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:25,750
What's the matter?

173
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,833
Something eating at you?

174
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,875
[RITSU] Dimple, you just
won't stop talking.

175
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:31,458
Oh?

176
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,625
[RITSU]

[BOTH scream]

354
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,375
[ARATAKA] That sure
shut those two up quick.

355
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,375
And I gotta say...

356
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,750
That last bit was great, Mob.

357
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,083
Huh?

358
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,041
You shook the building
to scare them, didn't ya?

359
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,375
Nu-uh.

360
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,125
I thought all that was you
sending the evil spirit

361
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,583
after those two.

362
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,583
Wait a second.

363
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,375
Are you saying you
couldn't see--?

364
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,833
[ARATAKA]
Come on.

365
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,500
Of course I could see it.

366
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,791
I can't believe them.

367
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,708
Con artists are
terrible people.

368
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,791
The worst of the worst.

369
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,208
You said it.

370
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,375
Only the lowest of the
low try to take advantage

371
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,916
of someone's weakness and
exploit it for their own gain.

372
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,041
[TOKUGAWA]
What? You as well?

373
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,041
Yes.

00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,583
He said, "So, you're
trash, too?"

375
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:49,166
And all I was doing was
chewing some gum during class.

376
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,541
[TOKUGAWA] Kamuro, this school
doesn't belong to you.

377
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,000
We still have other pieces
of trash to deal with.

378
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,541
Let's keep things moving.

379
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,291
[RITSU]
You plan to continue this?

380
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,416
[SHINJI]
Come on.

381
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,791
You're not going to
suggest we stop, are you?

382
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,041
[RITSU] No.

383
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,458
It just that you make me
feel sick, that's all.

384
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,250
You get off on
this, don't you?

385
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,583
[SHINJI chuckles]

386
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,416
I was correct in choosing
you as an accomplice.

387
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,333
If you knew, why did
you decide to help me?

388
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,875
[RITSU]
Because I was tired.

389
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,708
Just tired of being myself.

390
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,458
Of everything. Maybe
I wanted to find out

391
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,416
what it would feel
like to be a fool.

392
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,583
There's more to it than that.

393
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,041
In the end, it made
us both popular.

394
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,541
You and I have
become the heroes

395
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,791
of this entire school.

396

So "looks-too-old-
for-school-guy"

398
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,125
[RITSU] I, on the other
hand, have obtained

399
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,875
a much bigger world.

400
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,125
By the way, President,

401
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,166
did you happen to find
any telepaths out there?

402
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,666
If I did, I wouldn't
be here now, would I?

403
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,875

00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,583
You can't put a bomb there!
That's cheating!

Kurata, would you mind being
a little quieter, please?

406
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,625
'Cause I've still got a few more
things I wanna say over here.

No, it's not! Now, man up!

410
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,291
Go to class, Onigawara!

will even talk to me anymore.

I see this place is
as rotten as the rumors

418
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,458
led me to believe.
More to the point...

419
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,541
What are you doing
on campus, Onigawara?

420
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,916
Infiltrating the school when you

421
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,208
haven't been showing
up to class?

[ONIGAWARA]
No!

00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,291
But I can't stay at home!

00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,000
If I do, my mom will
ask me why I'm not--

425
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,583
[MUSASHI]
Listen to me, President.

426
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,875
Onigawara didn't do
what you think he did.

427
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,708
Should I have you all dealt with
for being his accomplices?

I have the power to do so.

showed up at the school gates.

I'm here for White T Poison!

Not to mention,
they were students

willing to get into a fight,

Disgusting.

For someone who wanted
to get rid of the garbage,

474
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,916
you should've started
with your own room.

No matter.

Either way, we still have trash
to contend with at school.

save us, understand?

puppet's been broken.

Ya know thugs from

are gonna keep showin' up.

do whatever I want.

Yeah!

talking about, Ritsu?

going on and, of course...

Are you that White T Poison guy
who beat Hanazawa and Kenzaki?

[TERU] What?! Is he
pretending to be Kageyama?

finally be settled

00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,166
once I deal with you guys,

506
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,833
so let's just say
you found your man.

00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,250
[TERU] It looks like
I'm gonna have to ask him

about this, myself.

[KOYAMA]
I found something interesting.

510
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,625
I believe he's the one
you were looking for.

511
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,875
I'll apprehend him
and head back.

512
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,166
But before that,
I should watch for a bit

513
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,000
and see how good he is.

00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,000
But, we... can't move!

00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,625
Now's my chance!

524
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,791
[AKAGI]
Huh?

525
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,166
[AKAGI screams]

526
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,791
Your magic tricks won't
work on me, White T Pois--

527
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,416
[GANG 7A]
Hey, what's goin' on here?

528
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,625
[GANG 7B]
Is White T Poison doing that?

529
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,541
[BANDAI] Maybe, but he
can't stop all of us!

530
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,791
Let's charge him!

531
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,250
[GANG MEMBERS gasp]

532
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,916
Don't worry, I won't
judge any of you.

533
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,708
I've come to
understand something.

534
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,666
When people wander
from the right path

535
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,458
in their lives, there
usually isn't any reason.

536
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,500
I guess it's always
been that way.

537
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,291
I'm facing enemies that
have lost the will to fight,

538
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,083
moving forward for
the sake of violence.

539
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,416
There's no reason there.

540
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,791
This kind of freedom is strong.

541
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:07,750
Boundless.

542
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,083
I'm much freer than all of you.

543
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,333
Why, you ask?

544
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,791
I'll tell you. Because
I've lost my limits.

545
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,750
I've obtained loss.

546
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:27,041
[footsteps]

547
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,416
[RITSU gasps]

548
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,750
It's you What are
you doing, Ritsu?

549
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,708
[ARATAKA]
The brothers confront each other

550
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,958
in an alley after school.

551
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,333
Suddenly, an adult esper we've

552
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,333
previously seen appears
out of nowhere.

553
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,125
Hey, Mob, that guy's
really bad news!

554
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,625
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> ,

555
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,958
Episode 8: "The Older Brother
Bows Destructive Intent."

556
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,916
I recommend the convenient
option A with the Blu-ray set!

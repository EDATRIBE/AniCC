00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,041
[NARRATOR]
Whether you believe it or not,

2
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,708
the world around you
is filled with

3
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:02,083
strange phenomena that
science has yet to explain.

4
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,666
And in those unfortunate moments

5
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,666
when people come
face to face with them,

6
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,125
they are helplessly thrown
into the dark depths of fear.

7
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,708
But, there are those who

8
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,916
choose to fight against
the darkness every day

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,458
shining a ray of hope
into that chaos.

10
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,000
These warriors
opposing the shadows

11
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,166
are called "Psychics."

12
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,791
You're in luck!

13
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,166
I, Reigen Arataka,
shall accept this job!

14
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,166
Oh, my god, really?

15
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,916
Thank you so much!

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,125
I had no idea who else
I could turn to!

17
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,000
No one would take me seriously!

18
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,208
[ARATAKA]
There, there. It's okay.

19
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,625
Now, the fee for my services

20
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:40,250
will depend on which course
of exorcism you pick.

21
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,791
[HANAKO]
"Which course"?

22
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,791
[ARATAKA] Option A, the trial
course, gets you 20 percent.

23
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,958
Option B, the serious course,
gets you 50 percent.

24
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,541
And Option C,
the all-out course,

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,375
gets you a 99 percent...

26
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,916
...spirit reduction.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,166
A hundred percent guaranteed,
certain restrictions apply.

28
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,291
[HANAKO]
Reduction?

29
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,500
How should I put this...

30
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,708
Spirits're kinda like
carbon dioxide.

31
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,291
So you're saying
they're poisonous?

32
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,458
That's monoxide.

33
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,708
I mean they occupy
a sort of gaseous space.

34
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,750
Makes it a bit
difficult to completely

35
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,416
get rid of one.

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,416
That said, have no fear.

37
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,250
If it comes back,
I'll get rid of it

38
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,791
for 20 percent off!

39
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,083
Oh! You're so amazing!

40
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,583
Hold on a second!

41
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,750
Huh? And, who might you be?

42
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,208
[HANAKO] Oh, this is Taro.
He's my boyfriend.

43
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,208
Ah, what a calm fellow!

44
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,583
What's that s'posed to mean?!

45
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,833
[groans] Stick to the subject.

46
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,375
Listen up, you!
This is all super shady!

47
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,541
[HANAKO]
Uh...

48
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,666
Hanako, you should
really reconsider this.

49
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,875
[ARATAKA]
"Super shady," huh?!

50
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,375
I guess I can't blame you
for feeling that way.

51
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,375
I mean, all that stuff about
nightmares and ghosts?

52
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,916
What a stupid story.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,291
I wasn't talkin' about her,
you snake-oil salesman!

54
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,166
It's you I can't trust!

55
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,833
[ARATAKA]
Just leave everything to me.

56
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,166
If I exorcise the
spirit, I'm sure

57
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,291
Hanako's face will
return to normal, too.

58
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,000
There's nothing wrong
with her face, you moron!

59
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,458
[ARATAKA]
I see.

60
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,041
So you've been
having these dreams

61
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,500
since you walked through that
abandoned building last week.

62
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,666
[HANAKO]
Yes, that's right.

63
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,625
They're so scary and creepy.

64
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,791
Here we are, Reigen!

65
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,833
It's that building over there!

66
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,458
[gasps] What an
unbelievable aura!

67
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:18,333
This will be my first
big one in a long time!

68
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,458
It's right over here.

69
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,333
[ARATAKA yelps]

70
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,500
Hold up.

71
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,041
Did you just point
at the wrong building?

72
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,250
[ARATAKA laughs nervously]

73
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,125
Hh? Ah, so it's that one!

74
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,625
Funny story--

75
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,583
An immense aura was coming from
that other building, too!

76
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,666
These things happen,
nature of "the biz."

77
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,125
It gets confusing with all these

78
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,041
evil spirits in
the world, you know?

79
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,750
Ah! Yes, that makes sense!

80
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,166
Come on.

81
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,833
There's no way ghosts are
hangin' around everywhere.

82
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,166
[ARATAKA]
Oh, no!

83
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,583
A man-shaped evil spirit
almost walked through you!

84
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,500
--Huh?
--[ARATAKA] Phew!

85
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,541
[ARATAKA]
What a close call.

86
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,000
You can't be too
careful these days.

87
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:48,958
[HANAKO, TARO gasp]

88
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,958
[HANAKO, TARO whimper]

00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,083
[TARO whimpering]

00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,583
[ARATAKA]
The Butt-chin Goblin.

91
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,958
[TARO] Aw, what are you,
eight years old?

92
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,208
Shut your mouth, Taro!
You're being rude!

93
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,166
He's the one who's
being rude here!

94
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,500
Making fun of people's looks...

95
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,750
[ARATAKA]
Now, now, Hanako...

96
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,416
There're always people like him.

97
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,791
Silly skeptics.

98
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,625
Anyway, shall we go?

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,458
[HANAKO]
They say this place is haunted

100
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,208
by the angry spirit of
a man who saw a cockroach.

101
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,125
He freaked out
and jumped so high,

102
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,666
his head went
through the ceiling!

103
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,833
Such a horrific way to go.

104
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:28,291
Get a grip. You believe
that horse crap?

105
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,666
Ah, I see.

106
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,250
Everything's...
becoming so clear.

107
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,333
[TARO gasps]

108
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,833
[TARO] He's so serious
all of a sudden.

109
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,291
Could there really be...

110
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,250
I'm getting creepy vibes.

111
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,541
Even someone like me might
not be able to handle it!

112
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,375
It's too dangerous!

113
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,833
[yelps]

114
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,916
[ARATAKA]
Cockroaches are terrifying!

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,791
[TARO]
Huh?

116
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,166
Come on!

117
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,708
There's no way
this guy is a psychic!

118
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,416
He's a complete and total fake!

119
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,625
[gasps]

120
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,750
[CEILING CRASHER]
How would you like me

121
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,166
to haunt your dreams, too?

122
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,875
A ghost!

123
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,416
Maybe I'll use my curse

124
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,375
and crash both your heads
through the ceiling.

125
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,791

126
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,083
That's the guy who keeps
head-butting me in my dreams!

Look!

Ugh. He actually appeared.

130
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,041
I've got this!

131
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,125
Salt Splash!

132
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,375
[NARRATOR] This is one of
Reigen's special attacks,

133
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,666
where he violently throws
table salt everywhere.

134
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,166
This is just regular
old salt, you buffoon.

135
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,166
If it's not purified,
it's not gonna work.

[ARATAKA]
Impossible...

137
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,333
I heard that spirits
were totally weak

138
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,291
against <i>any</i> kind of salt!

139
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,833
Well, if salt won't
melt this guy down,

140
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,583
I'll just call
my ultimate weapon.

Hey, Mob.

Sorry, do you think
you could swing by?

Evil spirit's right
in front of me.

00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,416
The client and the evil
spirit are both waiting,

147
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,583
so you'll need to hurry, okay?

Heh.

155
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,333
So after the salt,

156
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,166
you're sending in
a middle schooler?

157
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,333
Get your--

00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,250
[NARRATOR]
He is Kageyama Shigeo,

00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,958
also known as Mob.

160
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,333
An actual psychic, mentoring
under the questionable

expertise of Reigen Arataka...

162
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,375
Who also happens to be
the protagonist of this story.

163
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:01,958
Master, I asked you not to
summon me on such short notice.

164
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,708
[ARATAKA]
Oh, man, you're a lifesaver!

165
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,583
Never thought that evil spirit
would actually show up.

166
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,000
Here. Your pay for the day.

167
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,416
[MOB]
Oh, thank you.

168
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,583
That one today was just
a lower-level spirit,

169
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,166
so I really shouldn't be
paying you more than half.

170
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,833
But, hey, I'm a nice guy.

171
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,666
Think of your full
pay as a bonus.

Right...

173
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,666

Hm?

00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,041
What's wrong? Are you
not okay with that?

Oh, no.

176
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,541
Just don't know
why you called me

177
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,208
to handle such a weak spirit.

178
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,041
I mean, ones like that--

179
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,375
Uh! You just don't get it.

180
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,541
When you reach my level,

181
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,541
you get so crazy-strong,
you end up melting

182
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,083
everyone around you
during a simple exorcism.

183
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,750
That's why I ask you to take
care of the weaker ones.

184
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,333
Really? If you say so.

185
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,791
I'm also not quite
sure what you mean

186
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,041
by "melt," either...

187
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,500
[ARATAKA] Well, of course
you don't, idiot!

188
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,666
That's because you
lack training!

189
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,708
You need to learn all you can
from me, your master!

190
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,333
Your powers are
meant to be used.

191
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,125
Not doing so would be a waste.

192
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,208
Working for me gives you

193
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,000
the opportunity to
help other people

194
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,916
and continue training
at the same time!

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,583
Two birds, one stone!

196
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,041
But if you misuse a
power such as yours,

197
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,000
it can only lead to your
own self-destruction.

198
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,875
That's why I'm teaching you
how to control your powers.

199
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,000
You don't want them
to go berserk, do you?

200
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,041
[ARATAKA]
Remember your promise.

201
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,958
You will not use
your psychic powers

202
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,833
against other people.

203
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,625
There you go again,
always bending spoons.

204
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,083
You really need
to stop doing that--

205
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,166
it's a bad habit!

206
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,625
Oh, come now, my dear.

207
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,500
Shigeo's going through puberty.

208
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,666
A young man should be able

209
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,708
to bend a spoon from
time to time, right?

210
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,041
[MOB]
Sorry.

211
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,083
And there <i>you</i> go,
spoiling the boy again.

212
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,541
You need to learn a thing
or two from Ritsu, Shige.

213
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,375
He got another perfect
score on his quiz today.

214
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,875
Come on, Mom,
anyone can do that.

215
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,250
Listen, if you ever need
someone to talk to,

216
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,583
let me know.

217
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,458
I'll always be there
for my big brother.

218
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,166
Thanks. I appreciate
it. Will do.

219
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,541
And, now you're spoiling
him as well, Ritsu.

220
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,208
The next one you
bend gets replaced

221
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,708
using your allowance, you hear?

222
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:41,708

Huh?

223
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,083
Sorry, dude. Tough break.

224
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,416
You're on your own
when it comes to

225
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,458
what Mom tells you.

00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,000
[MOB'S DAD laughs]

227

Beautiful day, isn't it?

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,208
Oh! Guess what I saw
on TV yesterday.

Okay, class.

238
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,875
So what would be the
answer for this one?

239
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,625
Let's go with Kageyama.

Yes, sir!

Uh... Um...

243
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,875
I have no idea.

[TEACHER 1A]
If you can't solve this,

245
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,333
that would mean the
only thing you know

246
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,250
how to do is addition.

247
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,083

Hello?

258
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,125
[ARATAKA]
Mob! How goes it?

259
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,791
Sorry to call you
two days in a row,

260
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,166
but could you come down
to the station right now?

261
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,041
Sure. What for?

262
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:02,916
Well...

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,250
We've got another job.

264
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,458
And it's a big one.

265
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,750
Right. Okay, see you soon.

266
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,166
[ARATAKA]
Today's job is from a local

267
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,958
neighborhood council.

268
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,250
It's over at Honeido Tunnel,
along the old highway.

269
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,125
It's a famous haunted place.

270
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,875
The tunnel's always
had some shady stories,

271
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,583
and though it's been
closed for years,

272
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,208
the bad rumors
just won't go away.

273
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,083
Also, a number of
college students

274
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,291
and bloggers have gone there
to snoop around a little

275
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,791
and went missing, likely
contributing to those rumors.

276
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,041
And this is the kicker.

277
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,250
[MOB] So, it's the site
of a huge group accident?

278
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,458
[ARATAKA]
Yeah.

279
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,250
The incident occurred
about 30 years ago.

280
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,375
From what it says here,

281
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,625
more than 20 people
died at once.

282
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,333
The bitter hatred
of all those people

283
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,625
must be swirling
around that tunnel.

284
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,083
Oh...

285
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,416

286
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,208

Stay on your toes, Mob.

287
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,791
Never know what might happen.

00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,500
[MOB]
Oh, right.

289
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,000
[ARATAKA]
This is it.

290
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,541
Well, let's take a look around.

291
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,708
I, Reigen Arataka, new star
of the paranormal world,

292
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,708
will clean this place up.

293
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,791
We're gonna exorcise
every last one of them!

294
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,041
[ARATAKA]
What's the big idea?!

295
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,458
What are you doing, student?!

296
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,208
You're coming, too!

297
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,000
It'll be bad if
the sun goes down.

298
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,000
Mob, are you listening?

299
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,083
Huh?

300
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,791
I'm gonna go melt
down a big one,

301
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,458
so follow me!

302
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,125
Okay?

303
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,583
Sure, if you want.

304
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,041
You seemed to have
it under control,

305
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,166
so I didn't think that
you'd need my help.

306
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,166
Idiot!

307
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,416
Who do you think's
gonna ex-- Ahem.

308
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,583
I mean, this is nothing really,

309
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,291
but stick with me so you
can learn something.

310
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,208
[MOB]
You're amazing, Master.

311
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,583
Huh?

312
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,666
I mean, this tunnel actually
seems pretty dangerous.

313
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,333
I can sense the
presence of a very

314
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,750
powerful spirit further down.

315
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,375
Usually, haunted
spots like these

316
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,125
end up being fake,

317
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,500
but, this time, it's
definitely the real deal.

318
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,333
If a normal person
happened to anger

319
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,250
the spirit in here...

320
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,250
[ARATAKA]
What would happen?

321
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,041

it out in one piece.

323
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,833
Of course they wouldn't.

324
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:39,583
That's why you and I
are going to exorcise it.

325
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,291
All right, here we go!

326
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,916
Let me take the lead.

327
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,625
I'll be counting
on you to support me

however you can from behind.

329
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,875
Right.

Yes, it is.

00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,791
Great.

333
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,125
We forgot to bring
flashlights with us.

334
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,583
[MOB] Master, don't
you feel something?

335
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,583
[ARATAKA]
Hm?

336
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,541
Well, it is pretty
humid in here.

337
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,833

No, I'm talking about auras.

[ARATAKA]
Oh, right, that.

00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,916
My nose is a little
stuffy today, so...

340
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,791
Does that have anything
to do with sensing auras?

341
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,791
When you get to
my level, it does.

Do you feel anything
down here at all?

"Feeling anything" would
be an understatement.

353
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,041
I'll leave the small fry to you.

354
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,375
Go, Mob!

355
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,750
Man, that's a lot of noise.

356
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,958
They're really
strong, aren't they?

357
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,625
Hm. If we were a
couple of normal people,

358
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,208
we might have been
in real danger.

359
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,750
Oh, well, I'm pretty sure
that took care of all of them.

360
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,750
Another piece of ca--

361
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,083
[grunts]

362
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,000
[ARATAKA] There's someone
right in front of me!

363
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,416
Who are you?!

364
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,208
An evil spirit?!

365
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,875
Oh, it's just a
wrestler screwing around

366
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:10,791
in the dark.

367
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,833
Don't scare me like that!

368
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,958
I thought you were
an evil spirit.

369
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,583
Now, go practice
somewhere else.

370
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,875
[MOB]
Uh, Master?

371
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,625
I'm sure you sense
it, but the boss

372
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,833
of the evil spirits is
over there, so watch out.

373
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:22,500
Okay?

374
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,250
Oh?

375
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,666
[BOSS chuckles]

376
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,916
[ARATAKA] Hmph, so you're
the boss here, huh?!

377
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,083
You may have tried to disguise
yourself as a wrestler,

378
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,375
but you can't fool me,
you trickster!

379
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,500
You fool!

380
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,666
In this tunnel...

381
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,583
When my biker gang
and I were driving

382
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,250
through it, the guy
in front happened

383
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,458
to slip on a banana peel.

384
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,875
We all died!

385
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,583
And I'm their leader!

386
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,625
Listen up, this tunnel...

387
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:57,750
...is my turf now.
Do you understand?!

388
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,000
I'll crush every last intruder!

389
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,083
Here we go!

390
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,625
I curse you!

391
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,833
Cigarette Burn Poltergeist!

392
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,583
[BOSS]
Wh-What?

393
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,875
My ignition attack...
Isn't working!

394
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:16,791
[ARATAKA]
Hmph.

395
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,208
[BOSS]
A forcefield? No way!

396
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,750
How could this power be
coming from someone like him?

397
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, crap!

398
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,916
I thought this guy was
just an average wimp!

399
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,291
Too late for
regrets now, spirit!

400
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,583
The moment you tried to take on

401
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,000
the genius psychic,
Reigen Arataka...

402
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,791
...was the moment
your fate was sealed!

403
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,833
You're gonna be exorcised!

404
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,833
Banishing Salt Punch!

405
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,791
[NARRATOR] This is one
of Reigen's special attacks,

406
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,416
where he punches the
enemy with his fist

407
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,000
covered in table salt.

408
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,250
[screams]

409
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,916
Hold on a second.
That didn't hurt at all.

410
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,500
Oh, dear.

411
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,375
[BOSS]
So, you are a fake.

412
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,166
[BOSS screams]

413
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,541
[BOSS]
I'm disappearing!

414
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,375
W-Wait! Wait!

415
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,833
Go back to the ozone layer.

416
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:05,000
[BOSS] We were just
being forced to do this!

417
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:05,791
Hm?

418
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,916
Uh--

419
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,833
Hey, what are you doing, Mob?

420
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,458
Hurry up and melt him, already.

421
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,958
Hold on a minute, Master.

422
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,291
Let's hear him out, first.

423
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,125
A-Ah, ah...

424
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,458
Sure, I may act
tough but neither me

425
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,250
nor my gang are anything
compared to the evil spirit

426
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,583
down the tunnel.

427
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,125
We've been getting
orders from him

428
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,291
all these years, and that's
why we've been scaring people

429
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,208
that come down here.

430
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,083
Heh.

431
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,500
Do you really think you can fool

432
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,500
the likes of Reigen with
such lies, you little speck?!

433
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,500
I'm not lying to you!

434
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,750
It's just-- If I
were to disappear

435
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,875
while being falsely accused...

436
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,958
My brothers, the Death Specters,

437
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,166
and I just couldn't
take take it!

438
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,500
Our memories would
never rest in peace!

439
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,750
That's all I wanted to say!

440
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,500
Now you can make me disappear,
or melt, or whatever!

441
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,125
So your big plan is to try
to make us pity you?

442
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,833
Don't let him fool you, Mob!

443
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,541
Those are nothing but the
typical lies of a con artist.

444
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,958
Melt him.

445
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,916
Before that, I'm gonna
go have a look.

446
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,208
Huh?

447
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,833
[MOB] It's a little weird
that the aura I felt

448
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,416
before coming in here
hasn't disappeared yet.

449
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,041
Something's still not right.

450
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,791
[ARATAKA]
Hm?

451
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,583
I-I thought so, too...

452
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,250
[BOSS]
Stop him!

453
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,291
[ARATAKA]
Huh?

454
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,125
No matter how strong
that kid may be,

455
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,500
he doesn't stand
a chance against it!

456
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,708
That thing is an evil
spirit that's lived

457
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,083
on this mountain for
hundreds of years.

458
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,833
Everyone that's died here

459
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,750
was killed by him,
you understand?!

460
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,666
S-So, you guys were
also killed by...

461
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,166
No.

462
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,541
Like I said, we just happened
to slip on a banana peel.

463
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,916
[yells]

464
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,291
[BOSS]
You get it now?!

465
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,833
If you care for that kid
at all, call him back.

466
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,125
Hurry!

467
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,416
Hey, Mob! Come back!

468
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,750
You listening to me? Come back!

Ah.

476
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,750
Oh! You're safe.

477
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,833
Yeah. That evil spirit
wasn't very powerful.

478
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,833
No way! Wh-Who are you?

479
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,375

Huh? Oh, I'm nobody...

480
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,625
You idiot!

481
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,500
You're Mob, and you
are the student of...

Oh, right. Sorry.

486
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,625
I thank you, Mob.

487
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,500
Now the Death Specters
Gang can leave

488
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,666
this tunnel and
pass on peacefully.

Oh, could this be yours?

490
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Huh?

00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,208

Huh?!

All right, here we go, Boss-man!

00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,083
I wanna thank you!

[GANG MEMBER 1B]
Thanks, dude.

497
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,791

Our work here is done. Let's go.

00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,500
Right.

501
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,583
By the way, Master...

00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,750
Huh?

503
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,000
Why didn't you do
anything back there?

504
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,250
Huh?!

00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:18,000
Uh, well, you know, uh...

00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,875
A-Ahem...

507
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,708
Didn't I tell you
from the beginning

508
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,041
that I'd leave the
small fries to you?

509
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,583
Oh, right.

00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,458
[STUDENT 1J]
What do you wanna do?

511
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,000
Let's get somethin' to eat.

512
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,708
I'm not gonna last
until I get home.

513
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:42,916
[STUDENT 1M]
Sounds like a plan.

514
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,166
Sorry to keep you
waiting. Shall we?

515
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,291
Sure.

516
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,333
[ARATAKA]
So, does ramen work for you?

517
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,125
Uh-huh.

518
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,541
All right, well, if
you're gonna add on

519
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,416
<i>chashu</i> pork, limit it to two.

520
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,583

Okay.

521
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,291
[RAMEN STAND OWNER]
Here ya go.

522
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,083
[ARATAKA] A group of
telepaths suddenly appear

523
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,625
and disturb Mob's daily life.

524
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,083
Having doubts about
his peaceful youth,

525
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,583
Mob heads into a world of women.

526
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,125
Where's the goal?
Which way's tomorrow?

527
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,666

Episode 2: "Doubts About Youth
The Telepathy Club Appears."

529
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,833
Watching it in real time?

530
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:16,875
Wise decision.

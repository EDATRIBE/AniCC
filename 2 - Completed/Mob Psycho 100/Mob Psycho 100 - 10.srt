1
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,791
[DIMPLE]
All right. Let's do this...

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,625
From here we should split up.

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:13,916
[TERU]
Okay.

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,375
[ISHIGURO] There are at least
three intruders in our facility.

5
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,500
Terada and Koyama
have been defeated.

6
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,541
It's time for you,
the Awakened, to shine!

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,666
You've endured the trials
of rigorous training

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,458
and came out strong.

9
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,875
Now's your chance to show
just how powerful we can be!

10
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:35,625
[LACKEYS cheering]

11
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,833
[ISHIGURO] Though...
none of you stand a chance.

12
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,958
[LACKEY A]
No way!

13
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,000
So all the Scars were sent
after the intruders?

14
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,583
That's big.
They must be worried.

15
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,291
When are we gonna
get in on the action?

16
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,291
I feel like all we do is lame
grunt work around here.

17
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,750
Just let it go, man.

18
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:27,875
'Cause those who don't awaken

19
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,666
will always be stuck
at the bottom.

20
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,875
Eventually, we'll end up
subordinates of kids like him.

21
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,958
Ain't that the truth.
Speaking of...

22
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,750
Did you hear about the
kid who was sent here

23
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,375
from HQ as a temp?

24
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,833
From what I understand,

25
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,625
he's an Awakened Child that
they created on their own.

26
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:46,041
A normal kid survived that
insane awakening experiment

27
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,666
HQ puts them through?

28
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,041
[LACKEY C]
Lucky!

29
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,333
I wanna be in an experiment
for the big-wigs, too.

30
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,125
You wanna die?
Don't even think about it.

31
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,458
The destruction of your mind's

32
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,416
just the beginning
of that torture.

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,916
Really? Gen, you know about HQ?

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,666
[GEN]
Just stories, mostly.

35
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,083
Heard the trials are so painful

36
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,958
most people don't
make it out alive.

37
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,000
After 20 years as
a lackey around here,

38
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,291
I've learned HQ is bad news.

39
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,791
You don't want nothin'
to do with those guys.

40
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,833
Wait...

41
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,125
Hang on a sec.

42
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,083
What the hell do you think
you guys are doin'?

43
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,791
Should've known it
wouldn't be easy.

44
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,541
[LACKEY D] What happened
to your trainers?!

45
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,666
Took them out.

46
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,250
[LACKEY B]
What?!

47
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,333
Can't believe they were beaten
by a bunch of snot-nosed kids.

48
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,250
We'll take care of--

49
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,208
Let 'em go!

50
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,291
No way! Are you serious?

51
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,833
I wasn't expecting that...
Are you sure?

52
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,458
Yeah. Just go.

53
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,458
Thanks, I appreciate it.

54
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:40,458
[TAKESHI] We aren't gonna get
stabbed in the back, are we?

55
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,625
What the hell?!
Why'd you--?!

56
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,708
[GEN] Shut your mouths,
you youngins!

57
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,333
You don't know anything
about how the world works!

58
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,500
An ESP-er and a normal human
are like night and day.

59
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,000
The difference in strength
is astronomical.

60
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,208
If it's a powerful one,
it's like zero versus ten.

61
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,875
There's no way you can win.

62
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,791
Damn it. If only my powers
had awakened, I could've...

63
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,000
[GEN]
Give it up.

64
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,500
If you don't awaken
the first time around,

65
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,125
there's no hope of it happening.

66
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:05,958
Ever.

67
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,416
[LACKEY C]
Wait. Seriously?

68
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,416
[LACKEY B] We're gonna
be lackeys forever?!

69
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,250
[LACKEY E] There's no way
you're fine with that, Gen!

70
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,791
[chuckles]

71
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,208
I don't think you kids are
really grasping the situation.

72
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,000
Claw will definitely
rule over this world.

73
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,041
And when they do,
all of us lackeys

74
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,500
who supported them
will be rewarded.

75
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,750
But for right now, we just
need to wait things out.

76
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,500
Until the day the revolution
is finally upon us!

77
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,458
[LACKEYS gasp]

78
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,625
Ah-hah. What do we have here?

79
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,125
From the looks of that door,

80
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,208
I'd say I found somewhere
or something pretty special.

81
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,166
Must be where they're keeping
Ritsu and the others.

82
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,583
[clattering]

83
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,750
[DIMPLE]
Hm?

84
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,708
[LACKEY F]
Uh?

85
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,666
I thought it was one of
the intruders at first,

86
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,375
but it's just security.

87
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,375
What are you
wanderin' around for?

88
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,541
Oh, so that's where I am!
I got a little turned around.

89
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,833
My sense of direction
is just terrible.

90
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,916
Just do your damn job, okay?

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,416
Right, sorry about that.

92
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
[LACKEY F]
Hmm...

93
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,250
What's over here?

94
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,041
I haven't actually been
inside this room yet.

95
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,708
Maybe I'll just have a peek
as long as I'm down here.

96
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,041
[LACKEY F]
Hold it!

97
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,583
You're lying.
You're an impostor.

98
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:21,583
[DIMPLE] I'm telling you to let
me see the room, small fries.

99
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,208
This guy's one of the intruders!

100
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,000
Everyone, release your powers!

101
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,041
[LACKEYS screaming]

102
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,083
[DIMPLE]
Whoa.

103
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,291
Individually,
they're no big deal,

104
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,625
but they're not bad
when they work together.

105
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,583
A normal human wouldn't
be able to escape from this.

106
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,625
How long do you think you can
keep this up, tough guy?!

107
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,375
Hey, nice effort.

108
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,375
[ALL gasp]

109
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,375
But you're still outclassed!

110
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,208
[LACKEYS screaming]

111
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,875
Now. Back to the matter at hand.

112
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,708
Let's see what's
goin' on in this room.

113
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,750
Hey, you! Explain this.

114
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,125
Uh. Well, th-this is the
awakening experiments room...

115
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,833
[DIMPLE] These look like
a bunch of torture devices.

116
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,208
[LACKEY F]
Yes...

117
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,250
Our organization discovered
that experiencing pain

118
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,750
is a catalyst to
being awakened.

119
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,333
[DIMPLE] Hmm... Actually,
they're not too far off.

120
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,583
But even after going
through that much pain,

121
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,458
all you guys can
do is momentarily

122
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,041
inconvenience someone.

123
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,750
In the end, the world really
does favor the gifted.

124
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,208
You'll never be A-listers.

125
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,000
You have a better chance
focusing on body building.

126
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,541
[MATSUO]
Is that so?

127
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,000
What do we have here?

128
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,208
It's not every day a ghost
wanders into our facilities.

129
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,541
How would you like
to become my ghost?

130
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:38,458
I promise I'll take
excellent care of you.

131
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,125
[chuckles]

132
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,000
So you wanna own me, do you?

133
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,541
[DIMPLE] Someone dangerous
just showed up.

134
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,000
Huh?!

135
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,208
You weren't able to find
them in their cage?!

136
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,041
Don't mess with me, punk!

137
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,625
I told you to bring 'em here!
So where are they?!

138
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,958
Well, you see, uh,

139
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,458
from the looks of it,
they got out on their own.

140
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,125
If you're lying to me,
I'll kick your lackey ass!

141
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,500
[LACKEY L]
I'm not lying. I swear!

142
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,833
Okay, then.

143
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:08,958
[sighs]

144
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,500
[TERU]
Good grief.

145
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,000
[TERU] I don't like imitating
those thugs from the alley,

146
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,625
but it seems to work
well on weaklings.

147
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,625
[LACKEY M]
This isn't over.

148
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,916
You're wide open! Ignite!

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,083
Ha, ha! With this flame, I'll--!

150
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,375
[TERU] Can't believe you
thought you could fight me.

151
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,625
Those powers are a joke.

152
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:34,291
It's funny. Everyone in
Claw seems a little--

153
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,083
[MIYAGAWA]
Aw, did you get burned?

154
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,458
[MIYAGAWA laughing]

155
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,541
[MIYAGAWA] What you're seeing
is true pyrokinesis.

156
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,041
The ability to wield
fire at will.

157
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,625
[TERU]
A Scar...

158
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,541
Are you the brat Koyama
was goin' on and on about?

159
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,583
How pathetic.

160
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,083
I'll turn your body to ash.

161
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,041
[MIYAGAWA]
I know what you're thinking.

162
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,375
"It's okay, my barrier
can withstand this!"

163
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,916
[MIYAGAWA laughing]

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,416
[MIYAGAWA]
The inside of your barrier

165
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,000
turns into an
insanely hot sauna.

166
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,833
So much so that your lungs
will burn when you breathe.

167
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:39,291
A stupid mistake amateurs like
you make time and time again.

168
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,583
[TERU]
You're the amateur here.

169
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,458
[MIYAGAWA]
Big talk, kid.

170
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,833
But in order to fight back,

171
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,708
you'll have to
drop your barrier.

172
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,375
And when you do, you'll
be burned to a crisp.

173
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,958
And if you keep this up,
you'll be steamed.

174
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,416
So that means this
fight is over.

175
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,250
Your options are
either burn to death

176
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,666
or surrender to me and hope--

177
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,791
[TERU]
Bring it on.

178
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:00,666
[laughs]

179
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,666
[MIYAGAWA]
Sure!

180
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,500
Prepare to die!

181
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,166
Now I won't spare you,
even if you beg me to!

182
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,583
But given how much
heat I'm throwing at you,

183
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,333
your pleading tears
would evaporate anyway!

184
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,708
[laughing]

185
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,583
[screaming]

186
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,125
Ow!

187
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,500
When I switched my barrier over,
my clothes got kinda singed.

188
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,083
It's true that you can't defend
and attack at the same time

189
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,583
with psychic powers.

190
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,500
So the solution was to put
a barrier around my attacker.

191
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,666
Uh? Well, guess
you're not listening.

192
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,375
You're causing a racket,
so I'll let you out.

193
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,208
[TERU]
Wow, that's surprising.

194
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,750
You can still move around
with all those burns?

195
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,333
Who knows?

196
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,541
Maybe people with pyrokinesis
have a higher tolerance to heat.

197
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,625
Either way...

198
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,416
Your arrogance and
lack of flexibility

199
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,041
led to your downfall.

200
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,208
And with that, I'm the winner.

201
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,458
[chuckles]

202
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,083
[TERU]
Whew! Now I'm sweating.

203
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,500
Maybe I was a little scared.

204
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,708
[SAKURAI]
I must say. Well done.

205
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,041
You're much stronger
than I was as a child.

206
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,625
However, I possess
more strength now

207
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,291
than you will have in
your whole lifetime.

208
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,166
It's the end of the road.
Just give up.

209
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:15,958
[chuckles]

210
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,958
Exaggerate much, buddy?

211
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,125
Oh, hello.
How's it goin' everyone?

212
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,583
So, uh... I'm looking
for my younger brother.

213
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,333
Apparently, he's somewhere
inside this building.

214
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,583
[MUKAI]
Yipee!

215
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,791
My dolls found one!
They found an intruder!

216
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,291
Hey, Tsucchi. Can I do
whatever I want with him?

217
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,083
Yeah, sure. You caught him,
so he's your toy now.

218
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,291
[MUKAI]
Yay!

219
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,541
I'm gonna go have a look!

220
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,541
If I don't hurry,
my dolls will break him

221
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,708
before I have a chance to play!

222
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,625
[TSUCHIYA]
Mukai, the puppet master.

223
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,750
Quite the ability she's got.

224
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,666
She can control all
those wooden dolls

225
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,541
remotely and telepathically,

226
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,125
holding an immortal
army in her hands.

227
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:13,375
And just look at her, so excited
over finding a new toy.

228
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,791
I wouldn't wanna
get on her bad side.

229
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,875
It's all clear now.

230
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,250
Then let's move. We need to
find the exit, and quickly.

231
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,416
[LACKEY N]
Ah-ha!

232
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,041
Found you, jail-breakers!

233
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,916
Ha! That was easy!

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,708
Sorry, you guys. Guess I
picked the wrong route.

235
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,791
No, don't worry.
You did just fine.

236
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,083
We'll force our way through.

237
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,458
Ya think so, brat?!

238
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,416
Now! Combination
Super Psychokine--

239
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,791
[LACKEYS grunting]

240
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,000
Holy crap!

241
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,541
It looks like their espers
aren't really all that strong.

242
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,875
Power-wise, they're all on
the same level as Hoshino.

243
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:50,875
What's that mean?

244
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,916
They're better off
punching people.

245
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,916
[SHO]
Not bad!

246
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,833
You're right about them
not being strong.

247
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,583
They're useless
as real soldiers.

248
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,166
[RITSU] I don't see a scar like
the trainers talked about.

249
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,625
He's not a part of
the upper echelon.

250
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:06,583
[RITSU]
Who are you?

251
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,708
Who, me? Wonder who I could be.

252
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,791
Perfect. We're dealing
with a smartass.

253
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,708
We're all in a bit of
a hurry right now.

254
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,166
We can play guessing
games some other time.

255
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,083
[SHO]
Now, now, no need to be so mean.

256
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,000
I thought we could
all be friends here.

257
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,458
This guy seems dangerous.

258
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,958
Agreed. We're finished.

259
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,958
It's okay. You guys
can go on ahead.

260
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,125
Kageyama.

261
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,250
I'll take care of
this one myself.

262
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,458
Hang on! I've got a
bad feeling about this!

263
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,041
Just give it up.
You can't defeat me.

264
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,625
[RITSU]
I don't believe that.

265
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,333
[gasps] Really? Why?

266
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,791
I mean you're not a moron
or anything, are you?

267
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,250
[RITSU]
Maybe...

268
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,083
Or maybe it's 'cause I know
someone stronger than you.

269
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,458
Is that so?

270
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,291
He must be one of the other
intruders, I take it?

271
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,000
Then, I suppose I'll just
have to use you as bait

272
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,416
and bring him out
of the shadows.

273
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,166
[TSUCHIYA grunting]

274
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,750
[MUKAI]
Tsucchi!

275
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,333
[TSUCHIYA]
Oh, Mukai.

276
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,000
You're back from
playtime already?

277
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,000
You're as ruthless as ever.

278
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,125
Wood scraps?

279
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:11,083
Hey, Mukai. What
happened to your dolls?

280
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,500
[cries]

281
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:21,583
That boy broke them.
He broke all my lovely dolls!

282
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,333
Leave this to me.

283
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,166
He's mine now.

284
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,291
[MOB]
Hm?

285
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,541
[TSUCHIYA]
Hey, you!

286
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,416
Tell me, are you one
of the intruders?

287
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
[TSUCHIYA]
He really is just a kid.

288
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,291
How could he possibly--?

289
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,458
Are you the violent-type
too, old lady?

290
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,833
[gasps]

291
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:44,000
You brat! Who are
you calling old, huh?!

292
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,291
Tsucchi!

293
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:52,208
You're not going to stop me
with telekinesis like that!

294
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,208
[ISHIGURO] Her ability
is hardening qigong,

295
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,208
which she uses to divert all of
her qi into her fists or knees

296
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,291
to make them more powerful.

297
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,208
She's a top-class fighter,
even among the Scars.

298
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,791
If she manages to lose,

299
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,666
you might actually have
to step in, Takeuchi.

300
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,708
And take this
intruder seriously.

301
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,541
[yells]

302
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,166
[TSUCHIYA] This could get tricky
if I give him enough time

303
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,625
to attack again.

304
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,833
[TSUCHIYA] These hits aren't
having much of an effect.

305
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,208
Is his qi guard
really that thick?

306
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,541
[TSUCHIYA]
Without any build up?!

307
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,500
[phone ringing]

308
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,541
Hey! Your damn
phone's ringing!

309
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,000
[TSUCHIYA]
Wait a minute. What the--?

310
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,833
You came this far,
so why are you crying?

311
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,125
Because... I really don't
wanna have to beat up a lady

312
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,750
during this rescue.

313
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:04,666
[MUKAI]
Huh?

314
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,291
[TSUCHIYA]
What did you say?

315
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:10,416
My master always told me guys
who go around beating up women

316
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,916
are the biggest losers
in the world.

317
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,750
You're quite the gentleman,
but that's an insult.

318
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,333
I'm giving you permission to
fight me fair and square, okay?

319
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,583
Give it everything you've got!

320
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,875
[screaming]

321
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,666
Stay away from me!

322
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,000
[DIMPLE]
Tch.

323
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,583
It sure looks like I drew
the short straw in this one.

324
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,875
[DIMPLE] I've never even
heard of this power.

325
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:40,000
This human can make evil
spirits his obedient pets.

326
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,375
[MATSUO]
You're good at running away.

327
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,791
But why don't you
leave that body behind?

328
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,916
It'd be easier to
move as a spirit.

329
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,916
[DIMPLE]
Huh?

330
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,041
Are you holding
that man hostage?

331
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,333
Forget him. He's not worth it.

332
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,041
[DIMPLE]
Crap!

333
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,666
[GUM-CHAN roars]

334
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,166
[MATSUO laughing]

335
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,541
[sighs]

336
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,583
[DIMPLE] This body won't
hold up much longer.

337
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,458
Only third-rate spirits
would let the body

338
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,416
they possessed be damaged.

339
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,750
But I have even less of a chance
of beating him in spirit form.

340
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,083
[DIMPLE]
In that case...

341
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,875
What exactly are
you trying to do?

342
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,500
[DIMPLE] I've noticed those
things return to their master

343
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,458
after they attack.

344
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,000
Now why would they be
trained to do that?

345
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,666
Maybe it's 'cause their master

346
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,625
isn't strong enough
to protect himself?

347
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,083
I see right through you!

348
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,333
[yelling]

349
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,041
[MATSUO]
He's fast!

350
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,416
Here, Cookie! Here, Gum!

351
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,583
[COOKIE, GUM-CHAN roar]

352
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,500
[MATSUO]
Now he can't come any closer.

353
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,666
What?!

354
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,541
[MATSUO]
Did he fall?

355
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,041
No, wait! He's not--?!

356
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,000
We can fight some other
time. See ya, dude!

357
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,750
I'm gonna crush you
in the next round!

358
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,958
[growls] Go! After that bastard!

359
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,083
Bring him to me!
He will be mine!

360
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,750
[DIMPLE]
Fooled ya, dumbass!

361
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,041
Oh, man, you fell for that?

362
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:04,875
[MATSUO]
Crap!

363
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,291
Get back here!

364
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,666
Three seconds should
be plenty of time.

365
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,541
How about a knuckle sandwich?!

366
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,708
[DIMPLE grunts]

367
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,291
[MATSUO]
Not so fast...

368
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,583
You're the one who
underestimated me.

369
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,041
What makes you think I only
have two evil spirits?

370
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,791
[DIMPLE] You mean... all those
around his waist are...?

371
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,291
Crap! There's nowhere to run!

372
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,833
[ISHIGURO] Looks like
Tsuchiya was defeated.

373
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,208
Takeuchi, I'm counting on you.

374
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,291
[TAKEUCHI]
Very well.

375
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,833
No one in the world is a match

376
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,875
for the power of
my super qigong.

377
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,083
I'll win, no matter what!

378
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,666
[ISHIGURO] Takeuchi,
the super qigong user.

379
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,041
His face changes in battle mode.

380
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,833
Even I can't completely
get a read on him.

381
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,541
What do you think?

382
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,500
I was thinking you should
all run away from here.

383
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,666
[ISHIGURO]
Why is that?

384
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,291
[TERU]
Simple. Because I know Kageyama.

385
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,708
[ISHIGURO]
Oh?

386
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,708
Not to mention, it's impossible
to take over the world

387
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,375
with psychic powers.

388
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,458
Use this opportunity to
wake up from that dream.

389
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,000
[ISHIGURO] You won
fighting against Miyagawa.

390
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,583
Why are you wasting your time

391
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,625
living among the normals when
you're such a powerful esper?

392
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,041
[SAKURAI] We are special
beings. And that's a fact.

393
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,916
Not a dream.

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,458
Long as you keep
believing that,

395
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,666
you will never be able
to take him down.

396
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,916
[groaning]

397
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,000
[MOB] I know you were trying to
do something, but I'm sorry.

398
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,666
I'm kind of in a hurry.

399
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,000
[MOB gasps]

400
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,916
N-No way...

401
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,583
Is that Ritsu?

402
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,416
What happened?

403
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,708
Oh, he's still breathing.
Thank goodness...

404
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,083
But I don't understand.

405
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,708
Why does my little brother have
to be put through all of this?

406
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:14,166
I just-- I don't get it.

407
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,333
It's unforgivable.

408
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,958
Well? What's the situation
here, young one?

409
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,291
Hope you haven't already
been defeated by others.

410
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,583
I haven't even used
my powers yet.

411
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,833
[MOB]
Did you do this to him?

412
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,333
[MUTO]
Not hiding your hostility, eh?

413
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,666
In that case,

414
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,666
I'll show you even greater
despair, free of charge.

415
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,583
[MOB]
No...

416
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,458
[MOB]
This... isn't real...

417
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:15,166
[MOB screaming]

418
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,541
Man, that was a close one.

419
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,125
He managed to amplify
the illusion Muto showed him

420
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,625
and reversed it.

421
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,125
But was it planned
or natural instinct?

422
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,250
[chuckles]

423
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,875
Gotta admit, he's
pretty interesting.

424
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,041
It was totally worth
using his brother as bait

425
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,583
to get him down here.

426
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,583
Not bad you two.

427
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,250
[ISHIGURO]
Out of the 11 Scars,

428
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,166
7 have been defeated
during this intrusion.

429
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,708
How should I explain that
situation to the boss?

430
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,416
[TERU] What's going on?
Kageyama actually lost?

431
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,875
It can't be.

432
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,958
The guy who carried those
two here... did he really--?

433
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,875
Hey, what's up?
It's okay, don't be scared!

434
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,791
[TERU] There's no way he'd
lose to someone like that!

435
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,000
Hi, I'm back! What's up?

436
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,375
Seems you captured
the others, too.

437
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,833
You look pretty happy.

438
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,958
[MATSUO]
Yes.

439
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,583
One of the intruders
is an evil spirit

440
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,541
who has a very strong ego.

441
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,166
[TERU]
They got Dimple, too?

442
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,125
This poison jar has hundreds of
evil spirits thrown inside it.

443
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,500
The one that survives
after viciously attacking

444
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,208
and devouring the others
becomes the ultimate pet.

445
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,291
What in the hell is this place?

446
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,833
No, wait! Stop it!

447
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,291
Let's talk about this! W-Wait!
You don't wanna eat me!

448
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,666
I have no nutritional value!

449
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,250
Help me, please!

450
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,250
I see it! There's the exit!

451
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,458
[GO]
Now we can call for help!

452
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,500
Wait! Stop, it's no use.

453
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:27,833
We've got a problem here.

454
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,666
What's wrong, Hoshino?

455
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,791
Damn! There's no way
we can get through that!

456
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,125
Wait a second, they're--!

457
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,375
What the--?

458
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,125
Did someone important
show up or something?

459
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,291
[gasps]

460
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,958
[TAKESHI]
That aura...

461
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,875
[GO]
Holy crap! Even I can feel it.

462
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,708
It's an insanely
powerful esper!

463
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,625
No way, it can't be.

464
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:54,041
There's only one person
with those powers.

465
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,541
[KAITO]
And that would be their leader.

466
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,250
[GROUP]
Claw's boss!

467
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,875
[ARATAKA] The boss of Claw
finally shows himself.

468
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,250
Yes, it's me.

469
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,250
I'm sorry I kept this hidden
from you so long, Mob.

470
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,583
No matter what happens
from now on,

471
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,000
live your life to the fullest.

472
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,583
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> ,

473
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,625
Episode 11: "Master Leader."

474
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,000
The serious option C?
An excellent decision.

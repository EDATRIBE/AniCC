00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:15,208
[STUDENT 4C] The guys from
Salt are crazy strong!

00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,833
You must be Salt Middle School's
"Tenga the Demon"!

5
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,250
Come on, that all ya got?

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,833
'Cause my buddies and me were
just gettin' warmed up.

Aw, crap!

Somebody get Teru!

00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,208
Huh?

Whoa...

[STUDENT 4G]
That's Teru for ya.

14
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,041
[STUDENT 4H] Yeah, but isn't
this kinda overkill?

15
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,458
[TERU]
It had to be done.

16
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,625
They had the nerve
to stand up to me.

17
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,541
If you show a pack
of idiots like these

18
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:40,708
you're out of their league,

19
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,250
they'll suddenly
bow down to you,

20
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,166
like completely
different people.

21
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,625
The same way that
all of you guys did.

22
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,958
[TERU] Not to mention,
it's never a bad idea

23
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,750
to have a bunch of
fools indebted to me.

24
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,250
[TERU] Be it through power
or through people:

25
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,541
I'm going to take advantage
of everything I can.

26
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,333
After all, I'm the main
character in this world.

Good morning.

00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,166
Lovely day, isn't it,
aye, partner?

31
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,041
Surprised?

32
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,250
Well, you know what they say.

33
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,666
"Yesterday's enemy could
be today's friend."

34
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,833
Hm? You wanna shake?

35
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,750
[DIMPLE yelping] What are
you doing? Stop! Wait, wait!

36
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,291
Hold on!

37
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,958
Y-You startled me!
Wh-What was that for?!

38
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,833
Wanted to make sure
I wasn't dreaming.

39
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,041
When you think that,
you're supposed

40
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,375
to pinch your own cheek!
Not slam me around!

41
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,125
Who are you?

42
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,458
Who? It's me, Dimple!

43
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,541
The religious group guy!

44
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,666
Come on, we had that fight
to the death yesterday?

45
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,416
[MOB] So, you didn't
completely disappear.

46
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,458
No! Wait! H-Hear me out!

47
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,625
I don't plan on living
out the rest of my life

48
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,416
as some spirit blob!

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,041
But aren't you already dead?

50
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,291
[DIMPLE]
Easy, Shige...

51
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,000
You're not supposed to go there.

52
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,166
An idol! A pro baseball player!

53
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,375
A movie star!

54
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,041
Everybody out there
has some kind of dream!

55
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,416
And I have an ambition, too.

56
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,208
To stand tall at the
top of all creation...

57
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,291
Basically...

58
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,666
God's my dream!

59
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,583
I fantasize about the day
I finally become God!

60
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,833
Oh...

61
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,291
That's why you made that
religious organization.

62
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,375
[DIMPLE]
Though it was destroyed.

63
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,541
But that taught me
an important lesson.

64
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,083
In order to gain command
over people's hearts,

65
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,416
one must show off some
strong psychic powers.

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,625
So what do ya say?

67
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,041
Team up with me!

00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,208
Let's shoot for the top
of the world together!

69
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,000
Do you have any
more final words?

70
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,416
[DIMPLE yelps]

71
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,416
Seriously--have some
compassion, will ya?!

72
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,750
I don't wanna leave just yet.

73
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,625
Please!

74
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,208
I won't do anything bad anymore!

75
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,583
Really? You promise?

76
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,375
Really! I promise!

77
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,125
[MOB]
All right.

78
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,375
I'll discuss it with my master.

79
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,958
Just don't do anything
weird here, at home,

80
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,833
or at my school.

81
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,083
[DIMPLE]
Heh. Talk about a softy.

82
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,500
I'll just bide my time and wait
for my chance to possess him.

83
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,291
Hey, Shige?

84
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,416
Mom says to hurry up
and eat breakfast.

85
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,583
Right. Coming.

86
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,916
Were you just
talking to somebody?

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,083
[MOB]
Nope, not me.

88
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,583
Okay, well... Anyway, hurry up.

89
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,583
[MOB]
Sure.

90
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,333
Your brother seems like
a totally cool guy, Lil' Shige.

91
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,583
My name's Shigeo, understand?

92
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,041
Call me "Little Shige"
again and I'll exorcise you.

93
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,750
[DIMPLE] Whoa! My bad!
Sorry about that, Shigeo.

94
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,958
[DIMPLE]
Just as I discovered yesterday,

95
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,125
it's hard to read
what Shigeo's thinking.

96
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,333
I must study his
personal and social life

97
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,166
if I ever hope
to figure him out.

98
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,291
If all goes well,
he could start to see me

99
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,125
as someone who
truly understands him.

100
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,375
Who knows?

101
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,916
Maybe he'll eventually
start relying on me.

102
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,375
[MEZATO]
Hey, you there...

103
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,666
You're Ritsu Kageyama from
Year 1, Class 3, right?

104
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,041
Yeah?

105
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,791
I'm Mezato, Year 2, Class 1,
from the school paper.

106
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,416
Do you have a few minutes?

107
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,416
[RITSU] You're in the same
class as my brother.

108
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,041
If you wanna know about
his psychic powers,

109
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,541
you should ask him yourself.

110
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,000
Aw, come on. Gimme a break.

111
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,041
Got something interesting
to tell you, too.

112
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:42,916
What do you mean?

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,541
Did something happen to Shige?

114
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,125
[ARATAKA] I accept
this spectral challenge.

115
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,291
I will exorcise the evil spirit

116
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,500
haunting the confines
of this photo.

117
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,083
And I'll need about two
hours to perform the rites.

118
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,208
[yelling]

119
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,875
[ARATAKA]
Graphic Exorcism!

120
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,750
[NARRATOR] This is one of
Reigen's special moves,

121
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,875
editing photos
with CG software...

122
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,208
[ARATAKA yells]

123
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,625
[NARRATOR] ...making them
look perfectly natural.

124
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:12,958
[ARATAKA]
Aw, crap!

125
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,125
I accidentally erased
the client's eyebrow, too!

126
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,333
Master.

127
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,708
[ARATAKA] Mob? I'm a
little busy right now.

128
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,750
Gimme a sec.

129
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,291
Wait. That's your master?

130
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,458
[MOB]
Yep.

131
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,541
He's Master Reigen,
a powerful psychic.

132
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,375
[DIMPLE]
You can't be serious...

133
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,750
[MOB]
What do you mean?

134
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,333
[DIMPLE] I don't feel
any spiritual power

135
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,916
coming from this guy at all.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,708
That idiot Shigeo is totally
getting used by him.

137
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,291
I could let him know, but...

138
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,250
Nah, this is fine.

139
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,708
I'm sure I'll find
a way to make use

140
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,083
of this knucklehead, too!

141
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,458
[ARATAKA]
There we go. All done.

142
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,750
Master, I've had this
spirit stuck to me

143
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,125
since this morning.

144
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,750
What do you think
I should do with it?

145
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,375
Maybe erase it, or...?

146
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,541
[ARATAKA]
Hm?

147
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,791
Uh...

148
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,083
[DIMPLE] Heh. You won't be
able to see me, ya fake.

149
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,791
Must be too weak
for me to see it.

150
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,083
[DIMPLE]
What?!

151
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,500
To put it in perspective,

152
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,250
it'd be about the same
as a ladybug on your shoulder.

153
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,083
Do whatever you want.

154
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,416
Lucky you.

155
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,291
Now, don't cause any harm
and I won't erase you.

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,916
[RITSU] There's nothing
that triggered it.

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,583
He's always had psychic powers.
He was born with them.

158
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,708
As far back as I can remember,

159
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:27,583
my brother has been causing
strange phenomena to happen.

160
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:32,083
To me, Shige... was the
standard of the world.

161
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,583
Huh?

162
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,666
[RITSU] Even so, he
hasn't used his powers

163
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,291
in front of others
in a long time.

164
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,958
What happened to him, anyway?

165
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,958
[MEZATO chuckles]
Oh, that.

166
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,333
Your brother's caused
quite a stir...

167
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,708
Hey, that kinda looks like you.

168
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:49,916
I don't see it.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,291
[DIMPLE]
Oh. That phone number...

170
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,958
Oh, I see...

171
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,583
Now my brethren are seeking

172
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,625
spiritual leadership
from Shigeo.

173
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:02,916
Are they quick to jump on
the next bandwagon or what?

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,458
[MEZATO]
Mob's hidden charisma managed

175
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,125
to bring out quite a bit of
adoration from a lot of people.

176
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,666
Pretty suddenly, too.

177
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,625
So much so that it
formed a new religion.

178
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,291
And I'm here telling
you about all this

179
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,625
because I think he
deserves more recognition.

180
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,375
With that in mind,
I'd like an exclusive

181
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,458
from your point of view--

182
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,041
Sorry, Mezato,
but I must decline.

183
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,375
My brother's powers aren't
some sideshow circus act.

184
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,250
[gasps] No, that's
not what I meant.

185
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,166
Well, yeah, maybe it is.

186
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,458
But he could get
really popular and...

187
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,791
[RITSU] All right, then.
I'll be going now.

188
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,000
[MEZATO]
Ritsu Kageyama...

189
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,208
His grades are at
the top of his class.

190
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,791
He's an attractive,
popular guy who's also great

191
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,958
at lots of different sports.

192
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,958
He's pretty much got
everything that Mob doesn't.

193
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,833
Jeez...

194
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,500
Despite what the-powers-that-be
want us to believe,

195
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,000
people really aren't
born equal at all.

196
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,208
[RITSU] Shige made my
whole world seem normal.

197
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,666
Psychic powers were a perfectly
ordinary existence for me.

198
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,500
Because I'm his little brother,

199
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,583
I thought that I'd be
able to use them, too.

200
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,458
That's what I wished for.

201
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,791
"Charisma"? Who cares?

202
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:19,333
"Popularity"? Give me a break!

203
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,916
Compared to psychic powers,
those qualities are cheap!

204
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,916
[MOB]
I'm leaving now.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,583
[RITSU]
Hey, wait up. I'll go with you.

206
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,125
Wow, this is rare.

207
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,791
You usually leave early.

208
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,416
[RITSU] Well, there isn't
a student council meeting

209
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,958
this morning. Also, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

210
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,166
He seems to be
pretty close to you.

211
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,708
I was wondering...

212
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,291
You don't use your
psychic powers very often.

213
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,291
Why is that?

214
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,291
Well, Don't always
have the chance.

215
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,708
That's where you're wrong!

216
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,708
There are plenty of
opportunities, dude!

217
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,333
I guess there isn't anything
you really want, then.

218
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,583
[MOB]
No...

219
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,000
It's just that using my
powers for everything

220
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,083
would be pointless.

221
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,333
Huh?

222
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,416
Having them is
kinda weird, anyway.

223
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,541
I mean, it's not like
they're needed for survival.

224
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,583
They're awesome!

225
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,291
You're the only one
who thinks that!

226
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,750
Using them isn't pointless!

227
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,208
You just don't realize
how useful they are!

228
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,458
What do you mean?

229
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,583
You're saying there're
things you can't have,

230
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,875
even if you use your powers?

231
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,541
That's not true at all!

232
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,458
You can even become G-O-D!

233
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,666
Muscles.

234
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,500
[DIMPLE]
What is he talking about?

235
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,625
[MOB] Or understanding
girls, knowing what to do

236
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,666
in social situations,
reading my surroundings.

237
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,958
I think there's even more--

238
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,833
like wisdom.

239
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,750
And, for that,
I envy you, Ritsu.

240
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:37,958
[gasps]

241
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,750
[MOB]
Yeah... Like this, for example.

242
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,208
Psychic powers can't even
help me solve math problems.

243
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,916
[groans]

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,833
[DIMPLE] If those powers of his
belonged to someone else,

245
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,750
we would've seen something
completely different

246
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,333
in this world.

247
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,875
What did you want with the Body
Improvement Club, anyway?

248
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,083
This is no place for a
bunch of delinquent thugs

249
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,791
like all of you guys.

250
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,833
Unlike the lot of you
with no ambition,

251
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,666
wasting your little lives away,

252
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,166
we try to better
ourselves, Onigawara.

253
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,916
Yeah? What about those
guys over there?

254
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,208
[MUSASHI] You wanna talk?
Let's go outside.

255
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,125
[ONIGAWARA]
He totally dodged the question!

256
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,708
[ONIGAWARA] I'll keep this
short and to the point.

257
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,708
You guys in the
Body Improvement Club

258
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,375
are the strongest dudes
in Salt Middle School.

259
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,583
I'm here to ask you
to brutally take down

260
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,041
those guys from Black
Vinegar Middle School!

261
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,291
Listen, this is lower-body
strengthening month,

262
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,875
so we don't have any time.

263
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,208
We are way too
busy doing squats.

264
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,125
Squats?! Are you kidding me?
What are you--?!

265
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,958
Fighting's dumb, okay?!

266
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,958
We don't spend hours
a day honing our bodies

267
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,166
and strengthening our muscles
for something so petty!

268
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,416
[SALT GANG gasps]

269
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,833
What did you say?!

270
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,125
[yells]

271
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,791
[groans]

272
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,666
Say no to violence.

273
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,041
[ONIGAWARA] He stopped
Yamazaki with one hand...

274
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,958
With these musclebound
freaks on our side,

275
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,083
we'd definitely be able to win!

276
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,750
[ONIGAWARA]
Uh... What?

277
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,458
That one guy obviously
hasn't improved his body...

278
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,375
[cackles]

279
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,708
Shigeo, you aren't
actually aiming

280
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,708
for this mindset, are you?

281
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,208
[WEATHER WOMAN 4A] And now
for a look at today's weather.

282
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,750
Although many areas across
the country will be sunny,

283
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,625
there's some instability
in the atmosphere.

284
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:37,125
This brings a higher chance
of thunderstorms and high winds.

285
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,333
So, if you're going out,
it may be a good idea...

286
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,916
[ONIGAWARA]
Gotta fight poison with poison.

287
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,375
Here's the plan...

288
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,291
Salt's extraterritoriality,
the Body Improvement Club,

289
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,125
will fight against
Teruki Hanazawa,

290
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,291
Black Middle School's
shadow leader!

291
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,625
I kinda know what you mean,

292
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,333
but you've got
that saying wrong.

293
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,958
And the Body Improvement Club
isn't really poison.

294
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,541
Plus, "extraterritoriality"
makes no sense here--

295
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,750
I think you just wanted
to say that to sound smart.

296
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,625
That word and that "poison"
phrase came up in class, too.

297
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,500
Guess Tenga's actually
payin' attention.

298
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,291
Who'd of thought?

299
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:05,916
That dummy--

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,833

00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,083
[SALT GANG 4A]
There it is! Demon Rush!

303
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,750
Tenga's special move
of repeated punches!

304
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:16,750
It's legendary!

305
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,458
Rarely seen by the human eye!

306
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,875
[SALT GANG 4B]
Though it becomes less rare

307
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,541
if he just uses it
whenever, like now!

308
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,791
[SALT GANG 4C groans]

309
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,208
[SALT GANG 4A]
You really are amazing, Tenga!

This is...

311
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,625
[MOB]
What does this say?

312
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,208
"Abhore"?

313
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,083
Did I offend somebody?

314
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,291
It's probably a love letter.
They spelled "adore" wrong.

315
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,041
Adore? Wha--?!

316
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,208
Though the whole thing
is definitely fake.

317
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,916
[MOB]
Huh?

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,083
This is a lie?

319
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,083
[DIMPLE] That's an angry
guy's handwriting.

320
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,083
It's clearly a fake love letter.

321
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,916
You're so unpopular,
you don't realize it.

322

[MOB]
It's not real, then?

323
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,916
Just let it go, Shigeo.

324
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,166
Just let it go.

325
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,083
[MOB]
A lie...

from Salt Middle School.

330
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,416
He doesn't give up, does he?

331
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,041
[BV GANG 4A] Uh, what does
"you rice bastards" mean?

332
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,583

00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,958
[ALL laugh]

336
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,291
My plan is so perfect
that I scare myself

337
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,833
with my own genius brain.

338
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,458
Now we wait for them
to take the bait,

339
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,958
and make our move.

340
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,708
I'm sure the guys from
Black Vinegar Middle School

341
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,208
will be there,

342
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,208
but will the guy from the
Body Improvement Club show up?

343
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,000

it's just a prank.

[ONIGAWARA]
Oh, no, he'll fall for it.

00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,916

on it to seal the deal.

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,083
And I added a heart!

Well, you know,

00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,958
if a girl is actually
waiting here, I'd feel bad.

I told you, that's a fantasy!

there's trouble!

I found this under a dumbbell.

376
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,791
Uh, nope, not at all.

00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,666
For the guy that Onigawara
called in to help,

380
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,541
he seems pretty quiet right now.

You're Kageyama, aren't you?

00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,666
Sorry about this, but we've
got a reputation to uphold.

No hard feelings, but we're
gonna have to take you hostage.

by that Onigawara guy, Shigeo.

Tough break...

We've already told Onigawara.

388
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,666
If he wants his friend
back in one piece,

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,958
then he needs to come
get you himself.

If there's one thing

care about more than anything,
it would be their image.

is pretty tough...

522
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,458
[TERU]
What's with this guy?

523
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,166
His presence barely registers,
so I didn't even notice him.

524
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,958
On top of that,
why's he tied up?

525
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,500
You shouldn't use
them against people.

526
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,375
What are you talking about?

527
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,666
[MOB] I'm talking about
your psychic powers.

528
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,583
The ones that you've
been hitting them with.

529
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,541
[sputters]

530
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,000
You should never
use them for fighting.

531
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,625
[ARATAKA] Teru, the handsome
esper, attacks Mob.

532
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,208
As men flee while psychic powers

533
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,125
and knives fly around the
thunderous battlefield,

534
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,791
a mysterious figure appears,
and a miracle happens!

535
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,208
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> ,

536
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,583
Episode 5: "OCHIMUSHA
Psychic Powers and Me."

537
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,958
Blu-ray? Another
excellent decision.

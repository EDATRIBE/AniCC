00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,333
[RITSU]
Wow!

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,833
Feels neat!

3
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,458
Hey, do you think I'll
be able to do this, too?

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:16,791
[MOB]
Mh-mm!

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,125
Of course. After all,
you're my little brother!

00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,333
[gasps]

7
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,791
[gasps]

00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,916
[RITSU]
He! Hoo! Ha!

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
[RITSU grunting]

10
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,875
[ARATAKA]
Everything's ready.

11
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,791
We will now begin the séance.

12
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,958
[gulps]

00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,791
--[ARATAKA grunts]
--[HITOSHI yelps]

14
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,708
Hey, tell me, is that you, Dad?

15
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,875
Do you know who I am?

16
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:37,250
Oh... Oh! Hitoshi!

17
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,000
I never thought
the day would come

18
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,041
when I would have the chance

19
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,916
to see your face
again, my son.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,625
Oh, Dad.

21
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,875
One thing...

22
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,916
When did you learn to
speak English so well?

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,208
Click! Loggin' out for a sec.

24
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,583
Huh?

25
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,250
[ARATAKA] Sorry, It doesn't
seem like I'm getting

26
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,708
a very good signal.

27
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,166
Were you satisfied, though?

28
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,166
Of course not!

29
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,000
Please, call him
back this instant!

30
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,916
[ARATAKA]
Whoa! Calm down, buddy!

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,750
It takes a lot of concentration
to head up a séance.

32
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,083
By the way, where is
your father from?

33
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,541
He wasn't local?

34
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,166
No, he was from
New Jersey in America.

35
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,625
[ARATAKA] Foreign languages
are automatically translated.

36
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,666
Oh!

37
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,750
It's an advanced
technique that does

38
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,125
something-or-other
to the wavelength

39
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,958
of the spirit's languages
and is hard to master.

40
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,916
But, don't worry, there will
not be an additional fee.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Amazing! But my
English isn't bad.

42
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,208
I'm pretty fluent.

43
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,541
Now, then...

44
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,208
Oh! Hey, Hitoshi!

45
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,333
How have things been goin'?

46
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,583
Kinda weird, but...

47
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,833
Whatever.

48
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,291
Hey, Dad. Ya know
when I was young?

49
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,416
You and I used to
play ball together.

50
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,666
And we did that one thing that
was popular on TV back then!

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,250
Would you do it for
me one last time?

52
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,625
[HITOSHI]
Dad?

53
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,791
Uh... What the heck was that?

54
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,791
That was the
"Cheeseburger Tornado,"

55
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,250
the main character's
special move in

56
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,500
"Junk Food Fighter Michael,"

57
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,583
the super popular
show at the time.

58
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,958
[HITOSHI] Wait...
Dad, what are you talk--?

59
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,666
Get to the point, Hitoshi.

60
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,333
I've come all the way
from the other side.

61
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,833
What do you want?

62
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,208
Well, I...

63
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,375
Aw, screw it!

64
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,875
You were never nice
to me, anyway, Dad!

65
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,416
Cough up the password
to the hidden safe,

66
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,458
you stupid old man!

67
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,833
I know there's
a fortune in there!

68
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,458
You're dead so
you don't need it!

69
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,416
Uh, let me see...

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,458
I believe the password
was my birthday.

71
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,791
Don't give me that
"birthday" crap!

72
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,541
It's thirteen letters
of the alphabet!

73
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,791
With that kind of money,

74
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,500
I'll have enough cash
for the rest of my life!

75
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,208
Oh! Wait a second,
now I remember!

76
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,208
The password is...

77
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,291
"GETAJOBYOUGOODFORNOTHINGBUM"!

78
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,500
[NARRATOR]
Like the Junk Food Fighter,

79
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,666
this is one of
Reigen's special moves:

80
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,125
using his body like a spring,
he smashes his fist

81
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,541
into his opponent's face
with a powerful spin.

82
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,458
[HITOSHI yelps]

83
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,750
Crap! I went too far!

84
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,041
The client's consciousness
logged out!

85
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:50,875
What happened?

86
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,333
Did you just take him down?

87
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:56,250
[ARATAKA] Yeah... But,
it was all in self defense.

88
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,208
Self defense, huh?

89
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,958
[ARATAKA]
Yep. Hey, you look kinda pale.

90
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,916
[MOB] If it's in
self defense, is it okay

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,583
to shave off someone's hair,

92
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,208
rip off their clothes,
destroy their pride,

93
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,833
make them lose their friends,
and completely demolish

94
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,500
the school they go to?

95
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,541
[ARATAKA] I think that's going
a bit beyond "self defense."

96
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,291
There are some times
when my psychic powers

97
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,833
go outta control.

98
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,791
And it always seems to happen
when I'm unconscious.

99
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,500
I don't want these
powers anymore.

100
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,833
It's too much.

101
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,125
If nothing else, I think
they're quite useful.

102
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,458
The way you use them when you
work as my apprentice?

103
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,250
So many clients have been
helped with those powers.

104
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,000
So don't just focus
on the negatives.

105
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,083
It's all about how you
use those knives, right?

106
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,791
Don't suppress yourself.

107
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,625
You hold the keys, here.
Maximize your potential.

108
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,625
You do that,

109
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,416
and you're gonna
be just fine, Mob.

110
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,791

[SALT GANG 4C]
Huh?

112
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,750
The shadow leader
system? Seriously?

00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:55,916
[ONIGAWARA]
Yeah.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,708
I completely lost
to that shadow leader

115
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,833
named Hanazawa, but the
guy who bested him

116
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,458
is from Salt Middle School.

117
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,458
[SALT GANG 4B]
No way! Someone that strong?

118
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,833
Yeah.

119
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm gonna find him and
make him our shadow leader.

120
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,875
It was you, wasn't it?

121
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,375
You caused the supernatural
stuff at Black Vinegar.

122
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,708
Uh, well, I--

123
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,083
[MEZATO]
You're basically the only person

124
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,500
who could do
something like that.

125
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,125
But according to the rumors,

126
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,916
a kid who goes there
can throw people around

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
just as easily as you do.

128
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,041
Who knows?

129
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,416
Maybe that means
he's an esper, too.

130
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,041
You guys met up at Black Vinegar
and fought, didn't you?

131
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,375
That's it, right?

132
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,833

00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,208
You don't wanna talk about it?

That's enough for today, then.

136
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,375
But someday soon, you're
definitely gonna tell me

137
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,833
all I wanna know.

No way!

140
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,666
That wasn't the work of aliens?

141
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,958
And, that aside...

espers around here

00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes, there are.

[TOME chuckles]

146
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,333
[TOME]
And you can find them.

147
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,291
But... He's the only
other one I've ever met.

148
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,166
[TOME] That's strange.
What about your master?

149
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,583
Ah...

150
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,458
Well, actually, I don't sense
anything from my master.

151
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,750
But that's 'cause his
powers aren't psychic,

152
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,291
they're spiritual.

Huh?

156
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,125
We'll find other
telepathic people!

157
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,916
Then take our first
step toward connecting

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,750
with life forms in outer space!

159
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,583
Think about it!

160
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,458
But, remember?

161
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,208
I'm not in the Telepathy Club.

162
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,500
Black Vinegar Middle
School's shadow leader?

163
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,083
Yeah, I lost to him.

164
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,833
That guy had some
seriously nice muscles.

165
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,250
Then who was it that beat him?

166
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,916
It was someone from the
Body Improvement Club, right?

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,875
He's a gentleman who usually has
quite a distaste for violence.

168

Do not involve him
in this. Be gone.

from Black Vinegar Middle
School last week, right?

leave it at that!

00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,666
I'm sorry, Kageyama.

180
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,916
Tenga's kind of a dummy.
He can't explain things--

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,791
[ONIGAWARA]
Shut up!

182
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,416
Stupid idiot!

183
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,458
I'm the one talking to him,
so just stay out of it!

184
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,791
[TOKUGAWA]
Well, then...

185
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,125
It appears that will be all

186
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,000
the student council's
activities for this month.

187
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,750
Is that all right,
President Kamuro?

188
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,416
[SHINJI]
I'm glad you asked.

189
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,958
It's not bad for a start,
but I think we need

190
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,125
something with
a bit more impact.

191
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,791
Right, first year Kageyama?

192
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,041
[gasps]

193
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,041
You rank as one of the
smartest in the nation,

194
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,708
so I want to hear your opinion.

195
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,833
[RITSU]
Well...

196
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,833
In our school, there
are a few students

197
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,250
who would be classified
as delinquents.

198
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,291
If the student council
could find a way

199
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,916
to reprimand them, I think
we'd be able to create

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,791
a more peaceful
school environment.

201
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,875
That sounds nice.

202
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,958
"A more peaceful school."

203
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,541
Yes. Let's do that.

204
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,833
[RITSU] I have to make it
a more comfortable place

205
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,000
for my brother.

206
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,666
[MITSUURA]
Kageyama, I presume?

207
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,000
[MITSUURA]
Thank goodness.

208
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,708
Guess there was a point
in waiting around after all.

209
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,000
Let me present my credentials.

210
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,833
[RITSU]
Awakening Lab?

211
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,666
[MITSUURA]
So, what do you think?

212
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,333
Why not give it a try?

213
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,000
This is an opportunity to
amplify your psychic powers

214
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,208
at my research facility!

215
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,708
[RITSU] Sounds like he's got
me confused with my brother.

216
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,416
Ah! Tome, take a look--

217
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,291
What is it? Another esper?!

218
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,833
[MOB]
No, I just thought this guy

219
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,500
had a really unique hairstyle.

220
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,250
Oh, wow! You're so right.

221
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,750
Stop fooling around already.

222
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,083
[MOB]
But... I was being serious.

223
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,166
[TOKUGAWA]
Oh, it's you, Kageyama.

224
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,208
Ah, Vice President Tokugawa.

225
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,375
[TOKUGAWA]
Loitering, huh?

226
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,333
I guess even people like you

227
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,333
feel like doing that
from time to time.

228
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,541
Like me?

229
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,333
I'm just an average
middle school student

230
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,666
you can find anywhere.

231
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,833
A totally simple and normal guy.

232
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,333
If you ask me, you won't find

233
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,583
a "totally simple" and
"normal" middle schooler

234
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,333
anywhere on this planet.

235
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,875
But, for whatever reason,

236
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,333
you want to be one and are still
trying to act out the part.

237
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,250
I'm not really sure I
understand what you're saying.

238
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,750
[TOKUGAWA] Despite having
abilities that would

239
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,041
always make you the
center of attention,

240
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,083
you consistently seem
to play the minor role

241
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,333
and let others
take the spotlight.

242
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,583
[TOKUGAWA]
Stop acting like your brother.

243
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,791
Hey, Captain! Kageyama's down!

244
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,958
[gasps] No, I'm fine.

245
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,291
Nice drive!

246
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,000
I think you're starting
to build up some stamina!

247
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,833
[RITSU]
Awakening Lab...

248
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,041
This place?

249
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,833
It's just an apartment complex--

250
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:04,958
Kageyama, you're here!
I'm so glad you showed up!

251
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,458
There's no research
facility here.

252
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,625
You lied to me!

253
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,750
[MITSUURA]
Now, now, just come in.

254
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,333
[MITSUURA]
Welcome!

255
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,333
[MITSUURA]
I call it the Awakening Lab!

256
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,166
[RITSU]
What is this place?

257
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,458
[MITSUURA]
I bought an apartment complex

258
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,916
and remodeled it.

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,375
I've hired the front
runners in the fields

260
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:28,708
of neuroscience and engineering,
and we do research here.

261
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,625
On the floor above us,
all of the other

262
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,583
esper kids are gathered.

263
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,166
Did you say others?

264
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,416
Yeah, other people,
just like you.

265
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,541
Look there.

266
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,791
Is it another weird haircut?

267
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,916
[MOB]
That's an adult esper.

268
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,833
[MOB] What is this
feeling coming over me?

269
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:53,166
It's kind of sickening.

270
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,666
Sorry, Tome. I was wrong again.

271
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,916
Hey, Mob. Take a look!

272
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,333
Isn't that hairstyle
super weird?

273
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,708
[MITSUURA]
Allow me to introduce them!

274
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,125
Standing before you is a group

275
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,375
of real espers that
the Mitsuura Group

276
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,250
worked hard to bring together!

277
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,625
First is Takeshi Hoshino.

278
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,166
Step back, I'm going all out!

279
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,041
He's psychokinetic!

280
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,708
[RITSU]
That's "amazing"?

281
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,208
[MITSUURA]
Next, we have Rei Kurosaki.

282
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,875
[MITSUURA] Her powers
of clairvoyance allow her

283
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,166
to pick the one
correct card out of ten!

284
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,916
Her efficiency rate is
a staggering 62 percent!

285
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,708
Yay! I was right again!

286
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,083
[RITSU]
Wait, that's it?

287
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,625
[MITSUURA]
Next, we have Go Asahi.

288
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:47,250
Behold, my flames
of fury! Ignite!

289
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,541
Huh?

290
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,375
Ignite! Ignite!

291
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,958
Ig-- There we go!

292
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:52,916
Oh, it went out.

293
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,666
He uses pyrokinesis.

294
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,458
[RITSU] Less useful
than a cheap lighter.

295
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,291
[MITSUURA] And here are
the Shiratori brothers:

296
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,208
Daichi and Kaito.

297
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,458
They're telepaths who can use

298
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,416
their power to communicate
with each other,

299
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,875
even when they're apart.

300
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,791
[RITSU]
And less useful than email.

301
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,916
[MITSUURA]
This is Shigeo Kageyama.

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,541
Now be nice to him, everyone.

303
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,791
It's a pleasure.

304
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,208
Nice to meet you.

305
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,083
Tell me...

306
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,583
Has Mitsuura helped you at all?

307
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,750
Well, yeah, what kind of
question is that?

308
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,625
[TAKESHI] Absolutely.
He's been good to us.

309
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,458
And he's really fascinated
with psychic powers.

310
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,666
Huh?

311
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,583
Though I'm wealthy,
it's just family money,

312
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,583
I did nothing to earn it.
I'm nothing special.

313
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,958
I don't believe
in doing anything

314
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,000
to make big advancements
in society or science.

315
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,000
I just want to become
an esper myself,

316
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,875
so I funded this
research facility to see

317
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,500
if I could make it happen.
That's the reason!

318
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,625
[RITSU] It's a childish
pipe dream, but if he's able

319
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,250
to achieve that goal,
I'd be interested.

320
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,041
I've always wanted to know
if there's power within me.

321
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,416
[SHINJI'S MOM] Well, you're
finally home, Shinji.

322
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,000
Student council again, huh?

323
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,500
Make sure you don't
fool around too much.

324
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,916
[gasps]

325
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,666
[SHINJI] My brother was
the student council president,

326
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,916
too, remember?

327
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,791
[SHINJI'S MOM]
But, unlike you, Takuya was also

328
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,083
good in his studies.

329
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,625
[TAKUYA] Exactly, Mom.
I'm embarrassed, Shinji.

330
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,875
[TAKUYA] You haven't even
hit a test score of 70 yet!

331
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,416
Are you really
my younger brother?

332
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,083
You have no talent at all.

333
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,375
So you became the student
council president, right?

334
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,166
You should have plenty
of time to study.

335
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,458
How much are you going to
disappoint Mom and Dad, anyway?

336
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,583
Elites like--

337
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,666
[MOB'S MOM]
Ugh, you really need to fix

338
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,708
that annoying habit of yours.

339
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,916
[MOB]
But it just bends on its own.

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,916
Ha, ha! My farts
bend things, too!

341
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,791
Oh, come on!

342
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,083
Stop that! We're eating dinner!

343
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,000
Shige, you should really
try to be more like Ritsu.

344
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,166
[MOB]
Yeah, I know.

345
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,416
Ritsu doesn't do any
weird stuff like me.

346
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,208
And he's super talented.

347
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,875
Kageyama. Good morning.

348
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,875
President, what's
going on, exactly?

349
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,500
And, why did you wanna
meet me here so early?

350
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,500
[SHINJI] See this?
It's a girl's recorder bag.

351
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,291
And what would you
presume is inside of it?

352
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,958
[RITSU]
A girl's recorder, I guess?

353
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,291
That's correct.

354
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,333
Okay...?

355
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,291
[SHINJI]
She won't be needing this...

356
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:22,750
President...

357
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,166
What do you think you're doing?

358
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,416
The answer's simple.

359
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,958
Why, a little spring
cleaning, of course.

360
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,000
Spring cleaning?

361
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,750
You said it yourself,
didn't you?

362
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,083
There are trashy students here

363
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,083
who're classified
as delinquents.

364
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,666
The student council needs
to get rid of them.

365
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,708
[RITSU]
Hey, hold on!

366
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,666
I never said
anything that extreme.

367
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,750
Don't twist my words around--

368
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,750
[SHINJI]
What do we have here, Kageyama?

369
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,458
I believe it's the
desk of our school's

370
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,750
biggest piece of trash...

371
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,791
Onigawara, the thug delinquent.

372
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,541
[gasps] Are you
serious, President?

373
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,958
Why would an elite like
you ever stoop to that?

374
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,791
[SHINJI]
"An elite", you say...

375
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,666
That's just an imaginary persona

376
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,625
I was labeled with
somewhere along the way.

377
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,583
You've realized it,
too, haven't you?

378
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,416
That the praise others
lavish upon you

379
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,041
doesn't actually fit
who you really are.

380
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,833
[gasps]

381
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,875
[SHINJI]
Come on. Help me, Kageyama.

382
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,000
You got another perfect
score on your test?

383
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,208
Good job!

384
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,916
[RITSU]
I-I'm...

385
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,041
Ritsu doesn't do any
weird stuff like me.

386
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,666
And he's super talented.

387
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,791
Stop acting like your brother.

388
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,375
[RITSU]
Even I...

389
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,541
[RITSU] Hey... do you think
I'll be able to do this, too?

390
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,208
[MOB]
Mm-hm.

391
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,000
[gasps]

392
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,083
Of course!

393
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,958
After all, you're
my little brother!

394
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:33,666
[RITSU]
Really?

395
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,750
Yay! I can't wait!

396
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,208
[STUDENT 6A]
Huh?

397
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,333
[panting]

398
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,333
[MUSASHI] All right,
we made it to our goal.

399
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,375
You got some good muscles
on you, Onigawara.

400
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,458
[panting] Damn it.

401
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,375
You called me out
here super early,

402
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,208
so I thought you were
finally gonna tell me

403
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,208
who the shadow leader is!

404
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,750
Remember this pain.

405
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,750
You may feel wrecked now,
but you'll feel amazing later.

406
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,166
The one you're looking for
is in the same state as you.

407
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,583
He's fighting with himself.

408
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,458
So you should change in the
same way he's hoping to.

409
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,125
[laughs] All right, fine!

410
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,041
Bring it on, dude!

411
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,750
[STUDENT 06N]
Something weird happened!

412
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,375
[STUDENT 06C]
Whoa, that's creepy!

413
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,416
[ALL shouting]

414
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,750
We're so grossed out,

415
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,333
how are we supposed to
stay in class with that?!

416
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,291
Now, now, please calm down.

417
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,666
I promise, the student
council will find

418
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,041
the culprit and put
a stop to all of this.

419
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,291
[whispering] Now's the time
to open up Onigawara's desk.

420
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,916
We'll have to inspect
everyone's belongings.

421
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,041
If they get caught like this,
they must be pretty stupid.

422
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,791
Oh, the teacher's not here yet?

423
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,250
[ONIGAWARA]
I was about to ruin my record

424
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,333
of never being late or absent.

425
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,208
What's the matter, Onigawara?
You seem out of breath.

426
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,125
Huh? What's Kamuro doing here?

427
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,125
What's going on anyway?

428
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,958
Did something happen?

429
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,458
[RITSU]
I found them.

430
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,375
They were all inside
Onigawara's desk.

431
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,166
Huh? Who are you?

432
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,666
Why are you going
through my stuff?

433
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,375
It was you! Don't deny it!

434
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,916
Deny what? What are
you talking--?

435
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,500
Pervert.

436
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,583
Who the hell just said that?!

437
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,916
What is this?

438
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,750
Wanna tell me exactly what
you found in my desk?

439
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,375
Every one of the girls'
missing recorder pieces

440
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,833
all stashed away
in your desk drawer.

441
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,083
You were going to lick them

442
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,333
to get your sick kicks
when no one was looking!

443
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,166
You're a pervert, Onigawara!

444
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,041
[ONIGAWARA]
What?

445
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,041
Kamuro, don't make me punch you!

446
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,750
[SHINJI] There's still time
to redeem yourself!

447
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,333
Apologize!

448
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,625
Seriously, what kind of
sicko crap is this?

449
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,458
Do I really look like someone
who'd do something like that?

450
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,791
You're violent with other people
and act like a low-life thug.

451
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,833
That's reason enough for
anyone not to trust you.

452
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,250
Now just hold on a minute!

453
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,666
It wasn't me, I tell ya!

454
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,458
Look, if I really wanted
to lick those things,

455
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,958
I'd take them out of the school!

456
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,458
Only a complete idiot would
leave them in his desk.

457
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,583
Well, you are
a complete idiot...

458
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,000
Stop trying to pin this
crap on me, Kamuro!

459
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,375
I didn't do it!

460
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,125
[RITSU]
There were some in his bag, too.

461
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,375
Take a look.

462
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,500
Guess he did take a few
of them out of school.

463
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,708
[ONIGAWARA]
My school bag...

464
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,208
I left it wide open
in my locker.

465
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,541
[SHINJI]
Nice, Kageyama!

466
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,083
You even put some in his bag!

467
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,375
You're into this.

468
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,875
You bastard!

00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,291

Now, don't let it get you down.

bad days now and then.

Did you see his face, Kageyama?

how to handle something

00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,250
Don't waste your breath.

526
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,500
Unlike Shigeo, I don't have
any special psychic powers.

527
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,083
Really, are you sure?

528
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,125
I figured since Mob's your
older brother and all...

529
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,625
[RITSU]
You figured wrong.

530
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,500
Why don't you get rid
of that ghost yourself?

531
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,041
Aren't you a psychic?

532
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,083
He quit by throwing a
spoon instead of a towel?

533
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,541
[laughs] He's got quite
the sense of humor,

534
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,125
I'll give him that much.

535
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,666
But, when it comes to talent,
he doesn't exactly seem blessed.

536
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,291
Actually, you might be wrong.

537
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,666
Take a look.

538
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,583
[RITSU]
Hm? What's that?

539
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:29,291
[RITSU]
It's not a balloon. What is it?

540
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,000
[ARATAKA]
Ritsu continues to go wild

541
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,291
by pairing up with Dimple.

542
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,375
And then the gang leader
alliance makes its move.

543
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,541
Meanwhile, some scary people
try to make Mob buy a vase.

544
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,125
Both brothers are
in huge trouble!

545
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,375
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> ,

546
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,625
Episode 7: "Exaltation
I've Obtained Loss."

547
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,958
Illegal downloads?
You're gonna be cursed.

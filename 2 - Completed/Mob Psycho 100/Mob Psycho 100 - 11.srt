00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,458
[ARATAKA]
Damn it, Mob.

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,291
You could've let me
know you had other plans.

4
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,416
Why do you think I gave you
a cellphone? Pick up, already!

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,666
You can just drop me off here.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,666
Uh, okay then, sure.
It's 8,810 yen.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,458
[whimpers]

8
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,958
[TAXI DRIVER A]
Sir!

9
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,458
What are you doin' so late out
in the middle of nowhere?

10
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,583
[ARATAKA]
Don't worry.

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,791
I'm not planning to
do anything crazy.

12
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:39,458
[ARATAKA] That kid... What the
heck is he doin' out here?

13
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:15,375
[MOB] Um... It's okay, Ritsu.
I'm pretty sure it's this way.

14
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,666
[RITSU]
Okay...

15
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,708
This is the same
place as earlier.

16
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,583
[MOB]
Sorry, this is all my fault

17
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,625
for saying we should
go exploring.

18
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,000
[RITSU]
Forget about it.

19
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,458
Let's just focus on finding
a way back, all right?

20
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,250
[MOB]
Hmm...

21
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,708
But how we gonna do that?

22
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,791
[RITSU]
Umm...

23
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,708
Oh, I know!

24
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,791
[MOB]
You do?

25
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,625
[RITSU]
I learned this in science class.

26
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,916
The side with moss
growing on it is north.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,333
Moss always grows in places
where the sun shines least!

28
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,958
You see?

29
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,166
This way is north.

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,166
This direction will
take us to the river.

31
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,708
Then we can get back to
where we were barbecuing.

32
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,041
Let's go!

33
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,500
Yeah!

34
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,875
[TERU]
Looks like you're awake.

35
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,833
Where are we? Ugh!

36
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,250
Hey, are you all right?

37
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,708
Do you remember anything
about how you lost?

38
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,458
[MOB]
No, not at all.

39
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,333
[RITSU]
Thank goodness. Are you okay?

40
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,958
Were you hit on the head?

41
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,083
I hope it's nothing serious.

42
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,083
Ritsu.

43
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,333
[gasps]

44
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,666
I'm so glad you're safe.

45
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,666
[MOB]
You're not hurt, are you?

46
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,625
No, but--

47
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,791
[MOB]
Let's hurry home.

48
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,125
That sound good, Hanazawa?

49
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,416
[TERU]
We can't.

50
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,083
I'm not sure why,

51
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,916
but it seems we're completely
powerless in this room.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,208
I tried repeatedly, but no luck.

53
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,791
Usually, I could bust a hole
in a wall like this one

54
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,750
with no problem.

55
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,333
Wow. Yeah, you're right.

56
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:50,125
But that's okay! We've got
Ritsu here with us!

57
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,291
[RITSU]
Huh?

58
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,666
Oh, yeah? What can
your little brother do?

59
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,916
He happens to be really smart.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,416
I can't do anything special
without using my psychic powers.

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,458
But he can figure things out
and solve anything.

62
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,083
Even without his powers.

63
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,541
Is that so?

64
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,541
It sounds like you're pretty
proud of him, aren't you?

65
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,125
Oh, very much so.
There's nobody I admire more.

66
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,166
[RITSU]
No fair...

67
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,791
[MOB]
Hm?

68
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,291
[RITSU]
You won't even let me apologize.

69
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:22,833
It's just not fair.
Even after everything I've--

70
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,750
Thank you, Brother.

71
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,708
[ISHIGURO]
The sanctity of your sealed room

72
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,125
is as amazing as
always, Sakurai.

73
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,291
[SAKURAI]
Of course it is.

74
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,750
All Frivolities aside, what now?

75
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,208
Do you plan on taking them in?

76
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,583
Making these intruders part
of the upper echelon?

77
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,041
[ISHIGURO]
You're jumping the gun.

78
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,166
First, we need to
brainwash them thoroughly.

79
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,833
[SHO] Whoa, hold on
a second, you guys.

80
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,500
You planning to turn
decent talent into junk?

81
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,041
Those middle schoolers
will be recruited to HQ.

82
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,333
It's a done deal.

83
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,166
[ISHIGURO] Hm... Your name
is Suzuki, correct?

84
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,458
I call the shots here
in the 7th Division,

85
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,666
and that would include
all personnel decisions.

86
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,291
I'll be taking them,
especially that one.

87
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,875
The kid who's in the uniform.

88
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,041
We'll be great friends.

89
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,625
[SAKURAI]
I suggest you quit acting like

90
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,500
you're more than a temp trainee.

91
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,958
I'm a bit blunter
than the others.

92
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,708
Come on. Don't get so worked up.

93
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,375
You're really upset about your
coworkers being defeated?

94
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,208
You guys must get along
better than I thought.

95
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,333
Lay off the sword play, old man.

96
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,583
That was a compliment.

97
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,458
Take it easy, Sakurai.

98
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,791
Everyone at HQ
hates one another.

99
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,750
Nothing like the happy
family out here.

100
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,833
[SAKURAI]
Hmph.

101
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,458
Kids these days.
They just don't get it.

102
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,541
[LACKEY A gasps]

103
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,958
Hey! You there!
Who the hell are you?!

104
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,583
[LACKEY B] Do you think
he's one of the intruders?

105
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,916
[LACKEY D]
Quick, get the others!

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,791
Hey, what are all you
guys talkin' about?

107
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,166
What's goin' on inside?

108
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,666
[LACKEY A] First thing's first,
you suspicious jerk!

109
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,916
Tell us who you are!

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,541
Oh. Sure, just a sec.

111
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,416
[LACKEY A]
Does he have a gun?! Careful!

112
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,916
Ah, wouldn't you know it?

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm completely out
of business cards.

114
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,125
Seriously?

115
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,375
His business card?

116
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,875
So anyway, back to
the matter at hand.

117
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,375
Is there something going
on inside that building?

118
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,625
[LACKEY A]
S-Stay back!

119
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,458
We have nothing to say
to some weird outsider!

120
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,833
Just get outta here!

121
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,666
Huh... That's kinda strange.

122
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,625
I'm usually informed
when something happens,

123
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,375
but I haven't heard anything.

124
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,500
I'll check again.

125
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,500
[LACKEYS mumbling]

126
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,083
What the heck is
he talking about?

127
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,458
Could he mean...?

128
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,833
So then, let's get straight
to the point, shall we?

129
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,041
Can everyone here
use psychic powers?

130
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,166
How does he know about that?

131
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,541
He's heard about
the organization?

132
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,333
Sorry, but I'm gettin'
nowhere with you guys.

133
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,541
Hold it right there,
you damned intruder!

134
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,625
Whoa, take it easy! I get
the feeling he might be--

135
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,583
I was thinking the same thing.

136
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,875
Let go of me.

137
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,291
I'm only here to discuss work
matters with my subordinate.

138
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,291
Your what? Wait a sec.
You don't mean--?

139
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,208
Everyone here works
under Ishiguro,

140
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,625
the 7th Division
Leader's subordinate.

141
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,000
But Ishiguro's a
subordinate of the boss,

142
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,083
which means...

143
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:05,000
[LACKEY I] Oh, crap! I was
so rude! I'm gonna be killed!

144
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,541
What's the matter?
Are you not feeling well?

145
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,958
Hey, someone help him in.

146
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,791
Surely you guys
have a break room.

147
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,500
He's-He's such a kind man!

148
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,541
He totally exudes superiority.
He's gotta be--!

149
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,083
[LACKEY L]
He's Claw's boss!

150
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,666
[LACKEY M]
He's come back to Japan!

151
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,916
[LACKEY N]
He's coming through!

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,666
[LACKEY O]
Make way!

153
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,041
[LACKEY P]
Pardon me. Reporting in!

154
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,416
[ISHIGURO]
What is it?

155
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,250
[LACKEY P] The boss has
arrived on-location from HQ.

156
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,083
[ALL gasp]

157
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,625
[ISHIGURO]
He's here?

158
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,708
He said he wouldn't be
back until next month.

159
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,458
[ARATAKA]
Hm?

160
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,500
Hey, look. Somebody just
ducked and hid upstairs.

161
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,583
What did you say?!

162
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,291
It's either an intruder
or an escapee!

163
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,250
Capture them!

164
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,125
[LACKEYS]
Yeah!

165

[GO grunts]

166
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,625
Looks like we got caught again.

167
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,000
Hang on, there's no need
to be violent with kids.

168
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,041
Oh! I'm sorry about that, boss!

169
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,625
Wait a second. So you're
the boss around here?

170
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,291
Well, I wouldn't
exactly say that.

171
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, come on. Don't be modest.

172
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,791
The real deal has no need
to brag to children.

173
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,458
We might actually be able
to get through to him.

174
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,166
'Scuse me! We were kidnapped
and brought to this place.

175
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,166
We're here totally
against our will!

176
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,458
Our friend is still
in custody somewhere.

177
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,250
Would you please help us out?

178
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,375
Did you guys really do
everything he just said?

179
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,125
[LACKEY Q] Well, uh-- Yes, but
we were just following orders.

180
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,750
You're blaming others for this?

181
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,291
[LACKEY Q]
I'm very sorry, sir!

182
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,000
Listen, just because you were
ordered to do something,

183
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,000
that doesn't mean it's
the right thing to do.

184
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,791
When underlings start
getting too obedient,

185
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,541
they're nothing but trash.

186
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,791
What? But, sir!

187
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,375
We thought we were
doing what we--!

188
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,958
[ARATAKA]
You fools!

189
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,500
[LACKEYS screaming]

190
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,083
[ARATAKA] Even if you're able
to rise to the top like that,

191
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,500
all you'll see
when you look down

192
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,083
is the filth you
left in your wake.

193
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,458
I'm not sure what you're
trying to do here,

194
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,250
but getting to the
top only feels good

195
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,416
when you do everything
the right way!

196
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,208
You just think about that!

197
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,625
Yeah, he's got a point.

198
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,375
I feel awful. We've been
doing such petty things.

199
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,750
Wow, that's crazy.

200
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,583
It's like they just
changed in an instant.

201
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,291
Oh man, this guy's in
a league of his own.

202
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,375
[MOB] Have you thought
of anything, Ritsu?

203
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,125
[RITSU] It's probably best
if we don't try anything now.

204
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,000
They'll stop by and
check on us for sure.

205
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,708
I say we conserve
our energy until then.

206
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,083
Sounds like a plan.

207
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,791
We'll have more options
when we get our powers back.

208
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,916
Speaking of, we can count on
your strength as well, can't we?

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,291
[MOB]
Huh?

210
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,625
It's my fault for involving
you two to begin with.

211
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,166
I'll help however I can.

212
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,541
Will he be okay?

213
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,833
Him? Oh, come on.

214
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,125
I was the one who was
almost burned to death.

215
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,416
Besides, if you really get
serious about going all out,

216
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,375
then two of us won't have to
put up a fight in any capacity.

217
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,916
[door opens]

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,250
They're here.

219
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,000
And they're roaming around
in a group, as always.

220
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,291
[MOB]
Uh?

221
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,333
There you are, Mob.

222
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,208
What the heck are you doing
in a place like this?

223
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,166
Oh, your little
brother's here, too.

224
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,208
What's up?

225
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,541
W-Wait a second,
who are you anyway?

226
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,875
And just how do you know
the Kageyama brothers?

227
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,125
Quiet, you!

228
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,833
Don't talk that way to
the big boss, got it?!

229
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,125
Th-The big boss?!

230
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,083
What are you doing here, Master?

231
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,875
[ALL]
His Master?!

232
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,166
A wig?

233
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,166
Hey, Mob. Who is this guy?

234
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,000
[TERU] So he's Kageyama's
master and the boss of Claw?!

235
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,875
This is our chance!

236
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,875
We're being held here
against our will!

237
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,166
Please, step aside
and let us go!

238
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,958
Why do you have
them trapped in here?

239
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,208
Uh. Well...

240
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,458
[LACKEY Q whispering]

241
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,541
I can't hear you.

242
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,208
[LACKEY Q]
It's top secret, so, uh...

243
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,416
[LACKEY Q whispering]

244
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,208
Oh, really?

245
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,541
Come on, guys. That's
a crime and you know it.

246
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,916
[LACKEYS]
We're very sorry, sir!

247
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,625
You're amazing, Master.

248
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,958
[RITSU] Did he really
manage to fool them?

249
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,125
[ARATAKA] All right,
let's get outta here.

250
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,833
[RITSU]
Can it be? Are we saved?

251
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,416
[LACKEY A]
Boss, where are you going?

252
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,166
[ARATAKA]
I said that we're leaving.

253
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,875
You should at least wait for
Division Leader Ishiguro.

254
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,583
Uh?

255
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,833
[ARATAKA]
Huh?

256
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,000
[ISHIGURO]
Who are you?

257
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,041
Doesn't look like
the boss to me.

258
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:13,208
[ARATAKA] Introduce yourselves,
criminal organization.

259
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,458
[ISHIGURO] I'm Ishiguro,
the 7th Division Leader

260
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,708
of the psychic
association, Claw.

261
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,250
And you are?

262
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:23,166
I'm the greatest psychic in
modern history, Reigen Arataka!

263
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,166
Feel free to Google me.

264
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,041
[LACKEY A]
What?!

265
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,916
So he's not the big boss man?!

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,666
[ISHIGURO] Fraud or not, you had
the nerve to disregard me

267
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,541
and call yourself the boss.

268
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,541
That's a severe offense.

269
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,666
Yeah, what're you talkin'
about, you shrimp?

270
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,250
Step aside or I'll
take care of you

271
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,666
with my green belt in
Shorinji Kenpo with a snap.

272
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,333
[TERU]
Damn, that's strong!

273
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,666
Uh, what is this?

274
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,541
You're a spirit specialist.
Stand back.

275
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,666
[ISHIGURO] You've gathered
some efficient pawns.

276
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,583
If you gather enough, you might
actually be able to oppose Claw.

277
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,083
D-Division Leader, wait!

278
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,416
If you attack him from that
angle, we're gonna die, too!

279
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,583
[ISHIGURO]
Like I care. Seems fitting.

280
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,166
That guy's your boss, isn't he?

281
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,666
No! We swear!

282
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,375
All of you,
go and hide somewhere.

283
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,916
Huh?

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,041
If you wanna make it big and
do something with your lives,

285
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,541
then you can't die here!

286
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,208
This is your chance
to free yourselves

287
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,041
from this shady organization.

288
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,208
So hurry!

289
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,375
Leave this to me and
my student and go!

290
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,750
You're such a kind man.

291
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,083
[LACKEY U]
Thank you!

292
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,041
Actually, I'll be going, too.

293
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,416
Ah! The ceiling fell!

294
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,583
[ISHIGURO]
You won't get away that easily.

295
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,750
[ARATAKA]
Whoa, what is goin' on here?

296
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,958
Are there seriously espers
out there other than Mob?

297
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,750
Unfortunately, I'm no match
for that kind of power.

298
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,375
It'll be a pretty tough
challenge for me, too.

299
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,875
And that means...

300
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,041
...it's up to you... Kageyama.

301
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,833
[ARATAKA]
Hm?

302
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,625
[ISHIGURO]
Yes. He's a strong one.

303
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,625
Let me take care of him.

304
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,791
I'll bet he's never
met anyone with powers

305
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,625
that exceed his before.

306
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,375
He's in for a surprise.

307
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,333
Let me make myself clear.

308
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,750
You're not getting
anywhere near me.

309
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,583
You'll be crushed.

310
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,458
Brother!

311
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,583
Some kinda gravity control?

312
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,708
Hey, Mob, what are you doing?

313
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,208
[MOB]
Master...

314
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,500
[ISHIGURO] Not bad. You're able
to resist my powers a bit.

315
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,791
Let's increase the gravity.

316
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,125
Anti-Esper Dropkick!

317
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,291
[NARRATOR] This is one of
Reigen's special moves.

318
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,875
To execute it, he dropkicks
an esper as hard as he can.

319
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,208
[ALL gasp]

320
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,166
Master...

321
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,333
[ARATAKA]
Mob.

322
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,958
Were you planning on
fighting these guys

323
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,958
with your psychic powers?

324
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,375
I told you that it's dangerous

325
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,250
to use them against
other people, remember?

326
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,833
Are you going to break the rule?

327
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:52,958
[gasps]

328
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,875
[RITSU]
He had a rule like that?

329
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,750
In order to save me,
he had no choice!

330
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,875
[ARATAKA]
Mob.

331
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,166
Is this true?
You felt that cornered?

332
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,791
[ARATAKA]
It must've been rough.

333
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,291
Listen.

334
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,875
Confrontation with others
is the hardest thing for him,

335
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,083
especially when it's
with adults like you.

336
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,125
Watching you guys
bully an awkward kid

337
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,750
who gets discouraged so
easily is hard to take

338
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,333
and it twists my stomach.

339
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,750
So show some decency and stop
stressing out my student!

340
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,625
Then you plan on fighting
us yourself, I take it?

341
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,250
Let me give you a bit of advice.

342
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,375
No matter the disagreement,
you shouldn't harm others.

343
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,666
[TERU]
But dropkicks are okay?

344
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,583
[ARATAKA] If you're too
stubborn or set in your ways

345
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,375
to take that advice,
then I'll fight you.

346
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,125
Either way, due to my position
as their temporary guardian,

347
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,041
I'm not going to
let them go at it.

348
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,916
So yes, I'll face you myself.

349
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
As peacefully as possible.

350
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,083
First off, show
me your powers...

351
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,416
...and I'll show you mine.

352
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,541
Starting with hypnosis!

353
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,500
Stare deeply into
this five yen coin.

354
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,166
Hmph. How foolish.

355
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,625
[SAKURAI] That's odd. I don't
sense anything from him.

356
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,916
[TERU]
Kageyama's master's powers...

357
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,958
Is he actually is an esper?

358
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,166
If this is a ruse,
it's gonna be dangerous.

359
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,750
While you're watching this
slowly swing back and forth...

360
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,666
...Hypnosis Punch!

361
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,791
[NARRATOR] This is another one
of Reigen's special moves,

362
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,625
where he suddenly
punches his opponent.

363
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,125
[RITSU]
A sucker punch?

364
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,083
That's not a special power,
that's just fighting dirty!

365
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,541
All right, guys.

366
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,208
[SAKURAI]
Quit messing around!

367
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,791
Hey! Be careful with that thing!

368
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,875
That's a really sharp katana!

369
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,333
This is Jugan.

370
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,041
It actually started out as
a toy sword made of plastic.

371
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,291
But after carrying it around

372
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,625
and cursing it again and
again over the years,

373
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,875
it became truly powerful.

374
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,000
Hey, hold on. Listen to me.

375
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,458
My little ones, time to
come out and play.

376
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,250
What do you think of the
evil spirts I've collected?

377
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,416
Think you'll be able to
handle them on your own?

378
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,000
No really, listen.

379
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,958
Ethereal Bodies Technique.

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
As you can see, I can freely
exit my physical body.

381
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,916
I'm even able to limitlessly
clone my ethereal form.

382
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,750
Come on, you're dealing
with children here.

383
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,250
[ISHIGURO]
Maybe I'll get a little angry.

384
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,916
Let me introduce
you to my Black Orbs.

385
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,500
Their varying gravity
will rip you apart.

386
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,833
[NARRATOR]
Reigen's plan backfired.

387
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,375
[ARATAKA] I was going to
try to reason with them

388
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,333
while they were
shocked from being hit,

389
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,291
but all I did was piss them off!

390
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,875
I blew it!

391
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,416
[NARRATOR]
Reigen was very confident

392
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,458
in defeating others
in arguments.

393
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,833
He'd never lost to anyone
in a verbal dispute,

394
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,958
no matter who they were.

395
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,583
[ARATAKA] But that's only
when I'm actually dealing

396
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,833
with normal human adults.

397
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,708
These irrational goons
who are full-on

398
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,333
trying to attack
middle school kids...

399
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,041
This bunch of deranged misfits

400
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,875
who are seriously talking about
taking over the world...

401
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,583
They're simply children
who failed to grow up.

402
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,125
How'd they end up like this?
Either way, new plan.

403
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,541
Mob! Run for it!

404
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,750
[ISHIGURO]
Die!

405
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,000
Ah! I'm being pulled in!

406
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,625
Holy crap! Pull him back!

407
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,083
Hang on, Master!

408
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,416
While I don't like the idea of
being sucked into a black hole,

409
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,875
don't rip my body apart
by pulling too hard!

410
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,666
Take it easy!

411
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,375
[ISHIGURO]
Maybe I went too far.

412
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:30,833
[explosion]

413
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,083
[ALL gasp]

414
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,791
That was rough...

415
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,666
You can defeat them
with psychic powers?

416
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,666
Give it a try.

417
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,708
Wha--?

418
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,666
Leave him alone!

419
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,625
[yells]

420
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,666
I'm surprised you dodged
that. Either way...

421
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,708
I think this look
suits you better.

422
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,500
Damn it. We're dealing with
some real weirdos here.

423
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,291
If they were evil spirits,
I'd be able to exorcise them.

424
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:36,041
Really? Ha, ha.
They are, so just try it.

425
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,583
Huh?

426
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,791
Guess you can just
exorcise them.

427
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,791
Bastard. I call upon
my ultimate creation.

428
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,916
Candy come out here!

429
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Wreak as much havoc as you want!

430
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,291
Screw that, we're
gettin' out of here.

431
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,791
Don't bother with them, Mob!

432
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,000
[TERU] Kageyama!
Use all of your powers!

433
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,791
Just blow these guys away!

434
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,125
No, don't!
Now stop fighting back!

435
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,750
I'm the adult,
so I'll deal with them!

436
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,708
Mob, there's no need for
you to stoop to their level!

437
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:11,000
Shige, you're the only one
of us who can stop them!

438
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,250
[MOB]
Yes... He's right.

439
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,916
I have to defeat them now.

440
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,791
[ARATAKA]
No! Stop! Don't fight back, Mob!

441
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,500
[MOB]
Ritsu's hurt.

442
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,291
[TERU] We've gotta fight
power with power!

443
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,833
At this rate,
we're all gonna die!

444
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,625
We just need to run away!

445
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,958
Get real!

446
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,208
How can we run when they
won't stop attacking us?!

447
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,625
Do it! Use the powers you
used that time before!

448
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,875
No, keep it together!

449
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,625
Don't go head-to-head
with someone

450
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,416
who has murder on their mind!

451
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,416
[ISHIGURO] All four of
you are going to hell.

452
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,625
[MOB] Ritsu... Hanazawa...
Master Reigen...

453
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,750
I can't just let them die.

454
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,500
[MOB] I have no choice but
to fight with all I've got.

455
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,541
[MOB]
If I can save them,

456
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,291
I don't care what happens
to the ones attacking me!

457
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:06,833
[gasps]

458
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,041
I'm warning you. Don't do it.

459
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,375
In the end, you're the one
who's gonna be suffering.

460
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,958
When things go south,

461
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,000
it's okay to run away
and save yourself!

462
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,541
[doorbell rings]

463
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,250
[MOB] Excuse me. I saw your sign
and thought I'd stop by.

464
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,541
[ARATAKA]
Sure, come on in.

465
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,208
How may I--?

466
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,875
Oh, it's just a kid.

467
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,333
All right, young man.
So what do you want?

468
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,958
[MOB]
Well, um. I'm an esper.

469
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,166
Huh?

470
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,375
[MOB] There are times
when I can't control

471
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,500
my powers too well,
and it gets kinda scary.

472
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,750
Let me guess, did somebody
tell you to come here

473
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,208
and say that to me?

474
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,333
No. I haven't talked
about this with anyone.

475
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,708
I saw your sign and thought

476
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,208
you might have the
same kind of abilities.

477
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,083
If I tried, I could
see spirits, too.

478
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,041
Well, come on in.

479
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,458
Sure.

480
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,500
I was troubled when
I was a kid, too.

481
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,416
[MOB]
Huh?

482
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,541
[ARATAKA]
Uh.

483
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,000
Listen, just because you have

484
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,958
these psychic powers
and abilities,

485
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,166
it doesn't mean you're any less
of a human than anyone else.

486
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,083
There are people who are fast,
people who are book smart,

487
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,916
and people with
strong body odor.

488
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,875
Psychic powers are
just like that:

489
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,416
Another characteristic.

490
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,083
You must embrace
that characteristic

491
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,333
as a part of yourself and
continue to live positively.

492
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,166
After all, the truth behind
one's charm is kindness.

493
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,208
So just be a good person.
You got it?

494
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,708
So may I come by and
talk to you again?

495
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,625
Yeah, I'm not so
sure about that.

496
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,208
I'm pretty busy, you know?

497
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,958
Anyway, you should
go home for tod-- Hot!

498
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,458
Move! You'll get burned!

499
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,375
Hey... You said--

500
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,083
You said you could see
ghosts, too, didn't you?

501
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,125
Do you know how
to exorcise them?

502
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,083
[ARATAKA] All right. Come again
tomorrow. Same time, okay?

503
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,041
Yeah? Really?

504
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:14,208
I'll show you exactly
how to use your powers.

505
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,208

506
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,541

Huh? Master...?

Master?

Master!

512
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,791
Master, please! Wake up!

513
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:13,375
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> ,
Episode 12: "Mob and Reigen."

514
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,916
This was in Master's will:

515
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,958
"Watching the finale in real
time is an excellent decision."

1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:09,791
[TOME] It looks like there
really aren't many espers

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,208
out here, are there?

3
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,750
I mean, all of these
people have walked by

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,541
and not one of them
has stood out to you.

5
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,333
Unless, of course, you're just
not saying anything to trick me.

6
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,333
No, there really
haven't been any.

7
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,666
[TOME]
Hm...

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,291
[TERU] Hey. So are
the two of you on a date?

9
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,333
[MOB gasps]

10
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,166
Whoa. This guy seems
pretty unique...

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,750
It's Hanazawa.

12
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,208
Sorry, but...
something's come up.

13
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,708
Cool if I borrow him for a bit?

14
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,708
Uh... Sure...

15
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,500
[MOB] Someone's
fighting under my name?

16
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,208
[TERU] Yeah. It's a student
from Salt Middle School.

17
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,875
You might even know him.

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,625
[TERU]
He's back that way.

19
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,541
You should go and take
a look for yourself.

20
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,083
[gasps]

21
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,875
It's you...

22
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,833
What are you doing, Ritsu?

23
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,708
Shige... What are
you doing here?

24
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,125
I'd ask you the
same thing, Ritsu.

25
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,833
[TERU]
Must be his younger brother.

26
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,041
[KOYAMA]
Who's this kid?

27
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,875
[MOB] Who are these people
piled up on the ground?

28
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,500
Did you do all this?

29
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,541
[MOB]
Ritsu...

30
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,916
Yes. I'm responsible.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,333
[gasps]

32
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,500
[TERU] Watching two siblings
fight isn't exactly

33
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,250
the classiest thing to do.

34
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,000
[MOB] Really?
This is your doing, Ritsu?

35
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,333
[RITSU]
It's true.

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,791
No way.

37
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,291
Come on, you're
just kidding, right?

38
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,291
I mean... seriously? Brother...

39
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,375
[RITSU]
Seriously. I did this.

40
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,333
See, I've finally
obtained psychic powers.

41
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,500
Huh?

42
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,708
Whoa, Ritsu! What do
you think you're doing?!

43
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,625
[RITSU]
Not another word, Dimple.

44
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,125
[DIMPLE]
Tch! He's drunk with power.

45
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,250
This is why I hate brats.

46
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,791
[DIMPLE] I'm not hanging around
for a battle I know he'll lose!

47
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,416
--[RITSU grunts]
--Dimple?

48
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,833
[RITSU]
Whatever. I don't need him.

49
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,833
I've got the hang of it now.

50
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,291
Listen, Brother.

51
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,250
I've come to realize
something very important.

52
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,041
What? What do you mean?

53
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,375
Look, if something's
bothering you--

54
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,375
[RITSU grunts]

55
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,500
[MOB grunts]

56
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,916
You do have psychic powers...

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,875
[RITSU]
I missed...

58
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,166
Ritsu... You did it!

59
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,250
[RITSU gasps]

60
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,333
[MOB]
You've wanted them for so long!

61
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,916
Do you remember?
Back when you were a little kid,

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,333
you'd cry your eyes out
'cause you couldn't bend spoons.

63
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,541
Who would've thought that now--

64
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,500
The situation hadn't
changed until recently.

65
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,916
Now listen to what
I was trying to tell you.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,750
I've always wanted
psychic powers.

67
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,750
And because you had them,
I'd always admired you, Brother.

68
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,250
Really? You're making me blush.

69
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,333
[RITSU] But that was just
a big misunderstanding.

70
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,750
It was?

71
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,333
[RITSU] I couldn't handle
my inferiority complex

72
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,250
and fear towards you...

73
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,208
So I was protecting
myself by thinking

74
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,375
it was simply admiration.

75
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,500
More than anything,
I was scared of you.

76
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,708
I never knew what you might do
if you got stressed out.

77
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,875
We could never even
have a fight as brothers.

78
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,166
I mean, that would
be suicidal, right?

79
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,375
I'd have no way to protect
myself from your powers.

80
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,750
So I did my best to
stay out of your way

81
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,750
and not cause
any trouble between us.

82
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,208
Now that's just
a humiliating past.

83
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,708
I tried so hard for so long,

84
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,958
no matter how crazy or
frustrated it made me...

85
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,708
And yet...

86
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,541
...you never worked hard
in your life, so why?!

87
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,833
But now I've obtained them.

88
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,458
Now I don't have to
be scared anymore.

89
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,583
The delusional
admiration is gone.

90
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,291
Actually...

91
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,708
...I've lost all interest
in our relationship.

92
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,666
So, this buddy-buddy act
of ours ends now.

93
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,916
It's over.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,416
Ritsu. I can tell.
That's all just a lie.

95
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,291
I want you to face me!

96
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,583
Hit me with the full force
of your powers!

97
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,291
[MOB] But I guess part
of what you said is true...

98
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,875
I am your brother.

99
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,500
And that means...

100
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,000
...I have to help
take care of you.

101
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,125
[RITSU gasps]

102
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,708
[MOB] I'm terribly sorry that
my little brother hurt you.

103
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,708
He lost his temper, that's all.

104
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,750
Please look past this
and be friends with him.

105
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,625
[RITSU]
Huh?

106
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,333
What'd you say?

107
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,708
You're the older brother
of that freak show?

108
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,625
Yes. And I'm very sorry.

109
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,833
[AKAGI]
You idiot!

110
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,125
Think that's enough
to be forgiven, do you?!

111
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,458
You need to grovel down
on your knees first!

112
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,458
[MOB]
Oh... Okay...

113
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,291
[RITSU whimpers]

114
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,000
Stop it.

115
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,541
Why would you do that?

116
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,416
Tch! What do you
think you're doing?!

117
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,416
Ritsu... There isn't any use
in trying to get rid of me...

118
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,375
I mean, we're brothers.

119
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,625
[phone rings]

120
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,708
[KOYAMA]
Hello?

121
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,791
[SAKURAI]
I'd like a status update.

122
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,541
It's been ten minutes
since you reported

123
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,375
that you've found the target.
What are you doing?

124
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,041
[KOYAMA] Thought while
I was here, I'd observe the--

125
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,125
[SAKURAI]
What are you, an idiot?

126
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,833
Hurry up and bring him here.

127
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,041
[KOYAMA]
All right, fine.

128
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,750
[SAKURAI] Actually...
just in case, send a photo.

129
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,875
It'd be a real pain in the ass
if you brought back

130
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,000
the wrong brat.

131
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,875
[KOYAMA]
Yeah, yeah...

132
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,583
[KOYAMA]
Mocking me...

133
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,666
There you go. Sent.

134
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,375
[SAKURAI]
Got it.

135
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,000
That's him... Shigeo Kageyama.

136
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,416
[KOYAMA]
Like I said...

137
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,833
[SAKURAI] Confirms the
"Awakening Lab's" data...

138
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,125
Tch. What a completely
exaggerated name.

139
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,708
It's embarrassing
to even have to say it.

140
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,625
[SAKURAI]
Now, listen. Don't mess this up.

141
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,708
The more information we leak,
the more annoying it'll be.

142
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,375
No fooling around.

143
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,708
[KOYAMA]
I got it, I got it...

144
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,916
Acting all high-and-mighty...

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,541
Let's get this wrapped up.

[GANG laughing]

The tables have turned!

[AKAGI]
White T Poison!

149
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,166
If you don't want us
to beat the crap

150
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,375
out of your brother,
then get your ass over here.

152
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,041
[MOB] Ah. Hold it.
You shouldn't do that.

153
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,416
[GOZU]
Huh?

154
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,541
I was hoping we'd end this.
No more hurting people.

155
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,666
There's been enough violence.

156
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,666
Now, just who in the hell do
you think you are, small fry?!

157
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,375
[BANDAI] Only the strongest
can give out orders like that.

158
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,541
And the strongest will rule.
That's the way of the world.

159
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,541
[RITSU] Just how pathetic
are these people?

160
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,291
The strongest one
here is obviously...

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,583
[RITSU grunts]

162
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,000
[KOYAMA]
You're exactly right.

163
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,916

Tch! Let go!

167
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,916
[KOYAMA] Like you said,
the strongest will rule.

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,041
It's such an obvious
thing that sometimes,

169
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,458
you forget about it.

170
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,791
Let me guess...

171
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,791
You guys figure that if
you're strong at fighting,

172
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,750
you can rule your school
and turfs, right?

173
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,916
That's cute. Really. Nice job.
You should keep it up.

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,916
But this guy's on a
completely different level.

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,083
You punks don't stand a chance
in hell of beating him.

176
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,583
[RITSU yelps]

177
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,583
[KOYAMA] So I'm gonna take him
from the fighting grounds.

00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,000
[GANG]

179
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,333
You can keep squabbling with
whomever else in peace.

180
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,500
He's comin' with me.

181
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,625
Hold it right there!
He's our target! You can't--

182
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,583
Yaugh!

How dare you treat
our boss like that?!

186
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,666
Wait, I got a bad feeling.

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,875

00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,041
[MEMBER C] This guy's
too strong... It's not fair...

00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,625
[KOYAMA chuckles]

191
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,208
You thugs are such
simple creatures...

192
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,833
Pathetic.

193
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,541
Uh?

194
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,083
My little brother...

195
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,458
Shige...

196
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,666
[KOYAMA]
Did I hit him too hard?

197
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,125
Well, if he dies,
I'd say he was just unlucky.

198

--[KOYAMA] Hey, tall guy.
--[FUJI gasps]

199
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,958
[KOYAMA] What's with
that angry stare, huh?

200
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,166
It wasn't angry... I was
just looking, that's all...

201
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,041
[KOYAMA]
Grovel and apologize to me!

202
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,208
Huh?!

203
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,375
[KOYAMA] We're reviewing
the scene you were

204
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,583
playing out earlier.

205
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,791
I know! All of you
should grovel!

206
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:46,791
Get on your knees!

207
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,166
[GANG whimpering]

208
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,166
[KOYAMA] Oh, do you need
a little added incentive?

209
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,500
If you don't grovel,
I'll kill you little punks.

[KOYAMA laughs]

211
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,416

What a sight to behold!

Look at all you
pathetic dipshits!

213
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,625
Let this be a lesson for those
who think they're badasses.

214
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,416
And I've got one piece of advice

215
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,625
for the rest of
your rotten lives.

216
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,291
Try to live by walking
on the side of the road,

217
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,833
so you don't cause
the strong ones

218
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,125
you can't handle any trouble.
See ya, brats.

00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,708
Damn it!

221

Wait... What are you--?

00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,333
I wasn't told anything
about this kid

233
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,666
having a brother
with psychic powers...

234
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,916
Let go of my brother...

So, you've put up a barrier.

Oooh, I'm shaking!

these powers against others...

He's that adult esper I noticed.

Love to stay and play,
but I've got other plans.

are ways to deal

He's not White T Poison's

00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,166
So, I'm gonna have to
make you disappear.

348
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,958
--O-Oh, crap!
--Run!

349
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,416
[MEMBER B]
H-Hurry!

350
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,666
[KOYAMA laughs] You really
think I'll let you get away

351
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,583
after everything you've seen?

352
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,958
[KOYAMA gulps]

353
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,041
[KOYAMA] Impossible!
I can't take him on anymore!

354
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,291
[KOYAMA]
You're coming with me!

355
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,375
He left and he didn't kill us?

356
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,583
We did it!

357
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,333
--Yeah!
--All right!

358
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,833
Amazing! You saved our lives!

359
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,083
What the--?

360
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,583
He's unconscious,
but still standing.

361
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,458
[TERU]
I'd stay away, if I were you.

362
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,208
It's still dangerous
to be near him.

363
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,416
[MEMBER A] You're from
Black Vinegar Middle School.

364
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,375
I can't believe someone
was able to push him

365
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,708
over the edge like that.
That's no ordinary guy.

366
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,666
[DIMPLE]
He left and took Ritsu with him.

367
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,541
Dammit! Looks like
we're too late!

368
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,416
[ARATAKA] This is rock salt
from the Himalayas.

369
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,458
It goes great
with pasta or meat.

370
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,125
It'll also come in handy
for our needs in the exorcism.

371
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,125
Your shoulders
feel heavy, right?

372
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,791
Yes. A fortuneteller said
there was something dense

373
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,333
weighing down on them.

374
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,541
[ARATAKA] So they just told
her that and took the money?

375
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,625
How irresponsible.

376
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,333
I know just what to do.

377
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,625
Uh, why are you--?

378
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,541
Ghosts and spirits are
completely powerless

379
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,083
against salt. First,
we'll weaken them

380
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,375
with the rock salt powder.

381
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,666
And with this scraping
noise by your ears...

382
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,041
This'll be really
annoying to spirits

383
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,458
that wanna live
in a quiet place.

384
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,750
Eventually, they'll grow
agitated and leave.

385
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,083
Phase two!

386
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,875
We'll use the hard
edges of the rock salt

387
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,916
and do a massage to loosen
up your tense muscles

388
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,458
and improve your blood flow.

389
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,458
[moans]

390
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,125
[ARATAKA] We'll place
a hot towel on your face

391
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,500
to cover your eyes.

392
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,458
This shuts out the spirits'
visual interferences.

393
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,208
Along with using aroma oils
to maximize your relaxation,

394
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,333
we'll light some incense
that spirits hate.

395
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:23,333
[CLIENT A moans]
Such a wonderful smell!

396
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,500
Aroma Runaway Express!

397
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,625
[NARRATOR] This is one of
Reigen's special moves,

398
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,125
where he sends his clients
on a specialized beauty trip

399
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,333
that relaxes the body and soul.

400
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,583
Oh, my goodness!
I feel so much younger!

401
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,333
That's an added bonus!

402
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,458
[ARATAKA] I'm so glad there was
no actual spirit to deal with.

403
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,000
This is the first time
I can remember

404
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,791
that Mob didn't
show up for work.

405
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,333
I'm gonna have to lecture him
when I see him, again...

406
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,791
[RITSU]
Brother...

407
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,041
If there's anything
troubling you, let me know.

408
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,333
I'll be there to listen anytime.

409
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,708
Shige, somethin' bothering you?

410
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,791
You sure everything's okay?

411
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,083
If you're not feelin' right,
I'm here to listen.

412
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,708
Oh, it's nothing.
Really. I'm fine, Ritsu.

413
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,083
Thanks for asking, though.

414
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,291
Sure.

415
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:16,458
[MOB]
Ritsu... Ritsu... I see, now...

416
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,916
I'm sorry I didn't
realize it sooner.

417
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,916
[MOB groans]

418
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,041
[gasps]

419
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,708
Good, you're finally awake.
I was worried.

420
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,541
[MOB]
Hanazawa... Where are we?

421
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,833
[TERU]
My apartment.

422
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,625
Dimple told me about
everything that happened.

423
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,250
Hey! Looking good, Shigeo...

424
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,750
[MOB]
Dimple... What's going on?

425
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,750
Why were you there with Ritsu?

426
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,250
It's a long story.

427
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,250
[MOB]
And he was kidnapped. Dimple...

428
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,125
Oh?

429
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,625
Are you to blame for all this?

430
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,125
[DIMPLE]
It's a misunderstanding!

431
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,750
I don't know who those guys are!

432
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,541
He doesn't, but I do.

433
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,125
[MOB, DIMPLE]
Huh?

434
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,541
They've been trying to follow me
around for a few years now.

435
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,583
[DIMPLE] Huh? Is that why
you live by yourself

436
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,125
even though you're
in middle school?

437
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,625
Let me give you
a little bit of advice.

438
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,291
Stay away from them.

439
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,625
[DIMPLE]
Huh?

440
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,291
But they've got my brother.

441
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,583
You'll die.

442
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,708
[MOB grunts]

443
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,416
[TERU] It's an organization
called Claw,

444
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
formed by dangerous espers.

445
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,541
They want a revolution and aim
to turn the world on its head.

446
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,291
Their ability to
function as a group

447
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,541
is first-rate and
there're over a hundred

448
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,125
who're actively involved.

449
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,166
[BOTH gasp]

450
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,166
You're kidding, right?

451
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,708
Over a hundred...

452
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,875
[TERU] There are plenty of
facilities across the world

453
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,375
that are researching ways to
manufacture psychic powers.

454
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:39,666
But the only one to succeed
at such an undertaking is Claw.

455
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,041
Apparently, they take child
espers who have yet to mature,

456
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,541
brainwash them,
and raise them as soldiers.

457
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,750
They aren't as powerful
as us Naturals,

458
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,333
but if you underestimate them,

459
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,291
their sheer numbers
will crush you.

460
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,666
[DIMPLE]
You know a lot about 'em.

461
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,958
Got most of my info
from one of their guys

462
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,791
who tried to kidnap me before.

463
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,500
Luckily though, that time
around, I taught him a lesson.

464
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,833
So basically, they're
a bunch of shady espers

465
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,041
from a dangerous group.
Hey, Shigeo, you're lucky.

466
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,166
You could've been
killed back there!

467
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,750
[MOB]
It doesn't matter...

468
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:14,500
Ritsu, my little brother,
was kidnapped.

469
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,333
I'm gonna go save him.

470
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,500
[DIMPLE]
Huh?

00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,875

Do you have a death wish?

00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,500
No, not at all.

473
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,375
Then calm down and think.

474
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,916

I think I can win.

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,625

00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,875

477
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,791
Have it your way.

478
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,708
But how do you think they found
out about your little brother?

479
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,625
I don't really have any idea.

480
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,458
Ah! I just remembered!

481
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,416
There's a research facility
where people like you

482
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,791
were gathering.

483
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,500
As a matter of fact,
Ritsu was there recently, too.

484
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,750
Are you serious?

485
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,791
So the information must
have leaked from there.

486
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,666
Maybe we should check it out.

487
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,791
But I have a bad
feeling about this...

488
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,791
I can lead you there.

Ah! This is terrible...

490
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,541
How could they do this
to civilians?

491
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,666
[TERU] It looks like they're
unconscious, but not dead.

he go?! That guy with the sword!

You need to answer
our questions first.

00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,625
Now tell me, did you
sell Ritsu Kageyama's

497
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,333
personal information to Claw?

498
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,333
To Claw? What's that?
Ritsu Kageyama?

499
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,791
You must be mistaken.

500
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,416
The one I invited here was
a kid named Shigeo Kageyama.

501
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,708
You're wrong. That's me.

502
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,291
It can't be!

503
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,375
This all started with
a misunderstanding,

504
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,333
and yet they really
managed to awaken Ritsu.

505

I don't what's going on.

And we were finally seeing some
hope in our research, too.

00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,708
It looks like this guy really
doesn't know anything.

509
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,750
Where are the other kids?

510
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:46,625
They were kidnapped.
Is all of this my fault?

511
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,625
[MITSUURA] To think there's
a group like that...

512
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,375
All right, so what
level of power

513
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,041
did the kids who
were kidnapped have?

[KOYAMA] Come on, brats.
Hurry and get out.

520
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:29,541
Quit dawdling. Keep moving.
Don't make me smack you.

521
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,958
Now, don't scare them
any more than necessary.

522
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,333
They'll be useless.

523
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,208

--Kageyama.

524
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,750
You look rough, are you okay?

525
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,166
Don't worry, I'm fine.

526
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,750
But listen, we really shouldn't
fight back right now.

530
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,708
Meanwhile, Mob rises
to save Ritsu.

531
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,833
That's right, Mob!
That's what you call a man.

532
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,375
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> ,

00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,083

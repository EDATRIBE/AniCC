1
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,583
[DIMPLE]
What a surprise.

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,625
Guess there are other
middle-school-aged espers

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,125
besides you, Shigeo.

4
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,666
But, looks to me
like he's surprised

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,833
to discover another
one, as well.

6
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:23,416
Impossible...
Are-Are you a natural?

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,750
Someone with powers like me?

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,625
And what's that creepy-looking
ball of energy next to you?

9
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,791
Huh?!

10
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,750
[TERU]
Are you that thing's master?

11
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,458
No, it's haunting me.

12
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,916
[TERU]
Well, whatever.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,333
There are a bunch of
questions I wanna ask you,

14
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,000
but first we need to
establish something.

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,750
How the hierarchy
works around here.

16
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,125
The what?

17
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,750
[DIMPLE] Now remember--
be careful, Shigeo.

18
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,958
Even you could get tripped up
if you don't take--

19
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,041
[TERU grunts]

20
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,208
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

21
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,333
What?!

22
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,458
Why do you keep
trying to attack me?

23
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,916
I haven't done anything
to you. Let's be fr--

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,041
[yells]

25
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,333
You've got him worried, pal.

26
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,083
[DIMPLE] Not that I don't
understand how he feels.

27
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,875
So far, I bet he's lived
his life as a big fish

28
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,041
in a very small pond.

29
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,416
And for the first time ever,

30
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,041
he's meeting someone who
could be his natural enemy.

31
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,833
If he doesn't establish
his superiority right away,

32
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,708
there will always be a struggle
for power between them.

33
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,250
But all that aside...

34
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,875
What's with those
weird movements?

35
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,375
They're kinda like wire stunts.

36
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,791
[MOB]
Telekinesis.

37
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,083
It lets you move objects
around and stuff.

38
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,666
So, are you up for doin' that?

39
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,083
Nah, makes me nauseous.

40
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,625
[groans]

41
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,083
[TERU] Using telekinesis,
I teleport to my opponents

42
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,875
and blow them away
with my Psycho Fist.

43
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,625
But, this strategy I use
against average people

44
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,708
looks like nothing more than
"weird movements" to him.

45
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,083
[TERU]
Damn it!

46
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,250
Shigeo...

47
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,000
You need to teach this
kid a lesson here.

48
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,458
Show him that you're not
someone to mess around with.

49
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,916
Come on. Look how he's standing.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,458
He's gonna attack again.

51
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,416
You need to retaliate and hit
him with something big, too.

52
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,625
No, I can't.

53
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,125
You're not supposed
to use psychic powers

54
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,583
against people, remember?

55
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,791
Don't be such an idiot!

56
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,458
Look at who you're
talking about!

57
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,541
That kid's putting his
abilities to good use

58
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,041
and living a fulfilling life!

59
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,958
On the flipside, look at you.

60
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,458
You live quietly, one
boring day after another.

61
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,833
Do you really think
there's anything appealing

62
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,458
about you without
your psychic powers?

63
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,333
[ARATAKA]
Listen very closely, Mob.

64
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,583
You and I are different.

65
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,666
We were born with
special and unique powers

66
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,583
that other people don't have.

67
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,666
Even so we mustn't
let it get to our heads

68
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,708
and think we're special
or above them.

69
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,291
People who're fast...

70
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,166
People who sing well...

71
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,916
People who're book smart...

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,083
People who're good at talking...

73
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,958
People who can use
psychic powers...

74
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,333
They're all unique and you
can't put one over the other.

75
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,166
Confidence in your
powers is fine,

76
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,791
but you mustn't get conceited.

77
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,625
Depending on how we
choose to use them,

78
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,416
they can also be deadly weapons.

79
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,416
They're just the same as knives.

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,666
And you know what not
to do with them, right?

81
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,416
Point them at other people?

82
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,458
Then, you understand perfectly.

83
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,708
Don't ever forget that.

84
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,375
That's the moral
code people like us

85
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,583
with special powers
need to live by.

86
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,375
That gets ruined once
you know Reigen said it.

87
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,083
Anyway, I won't use
them in a fight.

88
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,625
Also, I don't wanna live a life

89
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,333
having to rely
on psychic powers.

90
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,083
I'm going to find
some other potential

91
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,500
within me to nurture.

92
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,000
Not to mention,
I started working out.

93
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,833
I'm gonna improve myself.

94
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,708
[DIMPLE]
You say that, but--

95
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,666
[DIMPLE]
Shigeo!

96
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,000
How'd you like that?!

97
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,125
A telekinetic tackle with
all my weight behind it!

98
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,750
You've been given psychic powers

99
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,458
but choose not to
use them? How stupid!

100
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,083
There's no reason
to live your life

101
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,458
stooping to the level
of average people!

102
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,166
Bringing out other
potentials when you have

103
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,000
these powers is useless!

104
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,583
Working out? Studying?

105
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,833
Ridiculous! Leave that
crap to the masses!

106
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,000
[TERU] Brains, brawn, and
even the law are powerless

107
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,333
before a gift like mine!

108
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,125
I'm special--better than others!

109
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,208
And the entire world
revolves around me!

110
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,500
[DIMPLE] Jeez, I guess
there's no choice.

111
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,000
Hey, little boy.

112
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,833
How about we just end all this
and call it a draw, okay?

113
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,708
No way. Ending in a draw
with a guy like that

114
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,750
would be the biggest
disgrace of my life.

115
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,500
I understand you
feeding your ego,

116
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,041
but I can't have you
breaking Shigeo, either.

117
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,375
He's not going to fight back,
so obviously he's going to lose.

118
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,166
And that...

119
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,291
...won't work.

120
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,958
[MOB]
Dimple...

121
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,500
[DIMPLE] Most of my spiritual
power's been erased,

122
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,333
so I'm pretty much just
some leftover scraps.

123
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,208
Even so, I shouldn't
have any problem

124
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,083
serving up some discipline...

125
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,375
...to a cocky little
brat like you.

126
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,875
Shigeo's someone who
can become a god.

127
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,083
He's not some second-rate
loser like y--

128
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,291
Huh?

129
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,958
Dimple, no!

130
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,000
[TERU] I erased that thing
with my Psycho Wave

131
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,666
from the core.
So there shouldn't be

132
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,166
a single shred of him left.

133
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,625
Dimple's been--
He was exorcised...

134
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,916
[DIMPLE]
Forget about your club.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,041
Work on your psychic
powers instead!

136
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,500
That Tsubomi's sure got
a nice ass, doesn't she?

137
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,583
Who the hell are you
calling a ladybug?!

138
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,791
How 'bout I send your
master to the hospital.

139
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,250
Come on! Listen to me!

140
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,291
I'll make ya popular.

141
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,500
Hey!

142
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,083
Want me to show you
how to use X-ray vision?

143
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,291
Ha! Fooled ya!

144
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't know either, ya pervert!

145
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,125
Just for a sec, would
you do me a solid

146
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,375
and let me take over your body?

147
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,291
Dimple...

148
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,833
What's wrong?

149
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,916
Does it actually bother you that
your little pet was erased?

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,583
No, not really.

151
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,875
[TERU]
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't be.

152
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,875
After all, it was sort of
a pointless existence

153
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,541
to begin with.

154
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,333
'Course your existence
is as pointless as his.

155
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,875
Compared to someone like me,
you're third rate.

156
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,250
Just a small fry.

157
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,041
[DIMPLE]
You can become big, Shigeo!

158
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,708
I guarantee it!

159
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,041
Some idiots get the
wrong idea if everything

160
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,416
isn't spelled out for them.

161
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,750
They actually think they
can be someone "special"

162
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,416
if they put in a little effort.

163
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,583
[DIMPLE]
Be more confident!

164
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,666
After all, you're
the main character!

165
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,750
[gasps]

166
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,958
What's with that look?

167
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,333
Got something to say?

168
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,541
Tell me, why do you have
to belittle other people

169
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,958
by calling them things like
"average" or "small fry"?

170
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,166
Huh?

171
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,500
I mean, I just realized
Dimple might've been

172
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,875
an okay guy, that's all.

173
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,500
Compared to you, anyway.

174
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,166
What did you say?

175
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,791
Bastard...

176
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,583
I'm going to wipe that smug
look right off of your face!

177
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,958
I'll make you submit

So, I hope you're ready.
Nothing will stand in my way!

180
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,916
That's dangerous.

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,791
If it wasn't me,
you could hurt someone.

182
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,333
So, stop.

00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,625
[TERU] Are you trying to tell
me that you won't get hurt?

184
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:48,625

underestimate my power!

You just gonna keep
defending yourself?

Look, I told you
to stop doing that.

something else.

Don't try to order
me around, runt.

of killing him.

Will you stop this?

208
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,333
You'll cause an accident.

You're gonna pay for this.

220
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,416
Huh? I didn't say that.

221
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,125
[TERU]
But you thought it.

222
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,708
No. That's fine.

223
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:03,166
I'll admit it. It's the truth!
I look ridiculous! It's awful!

224
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,791
But now that it's come to this,

225
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,625
I feel I must know your name.

I'm Teruki. Teruki Hanazawa.

No, it's not nice.

233
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,083
It isn't as if we're
friends now or anything.

234
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,041
I just wanted to know
the name of my enemy

You've gotta start
fighting back!

Stop stalling and face me!

I'm popular and the

This entire world

revolves around me!

245
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:56,083
I am the chosen one--
me, Teruki Hanazawa!

246
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,625
I don't get it.

247
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,500
How are you able to find all
of this confidence in yourself?

248
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,416
[TERU]
What a stupid question!

249
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,666
It's my psychic
powers, of course!

250
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,541
I can control the

00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,791
And you are my first enemy!

Now, attack me!

Let's have a test of strength!

255
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,708
No way.

256
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,291
Why not?! I told you it's okay!

257
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,458
Come at me!

258
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,458
Because...

259
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,166
I don't wanma hurt
you, that's why.

260
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,166
Huh?

262
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,333
Are you kidding? That's absurd!

It's not like I'm
some "Average Joe"

00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,333
you're dealing with here!

265
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,958
I'm on a different
level than the rest

of the lowly creatures
on this planet!

267
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,291
Just because you're able
to use psychic powers,

268
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,041
you're no better than--

269
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,041
[TERU]
What'd you say?

270
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,333
Uh, I mean--

271
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,666
You're kinda goin'
overboard here.

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,208
[TERU]
Think so?

273
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,250
Well, you're the only person
who could make that argument.

274
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,333
That's why your very
existence pisses me off!

Hold on... That's it!

276
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:54,041
I think I just realized
why you hate me so much.

277
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,166
It's because you
and I are the same.

278
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,291
And not because we both
have psychic powers.

279
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,166
But the fact that you have
no confidence in yourself...

280
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,041
...same way that I don't.

281
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,083
If you take away your abilities,
there'll be nothing left.

00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,833
You'll be empty.

that realization.

No friends, no standing out.

leave a mark in this world.

Deep down, you're
the same as I am.

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,291
[gasps]

354
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,875
What is that thing?

355
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,208
[TERU] Do you finally
feel like fighting?

356
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,750
Good!

357
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,583
In the end, you couldn't stay
true to your ideals, either!

358
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,083
Bring it! Ultimate Barrier!

359
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,250
[TERU groans]

360
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:59,291
[TERU coughing]

361
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,208
[TERU]
You used them! Kageyama!

362
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,500
You couldn't stand it anymore
and used your psychic powers!

363
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,208
[TERU laughs]

364
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,500
You broke down and used them
against another person!

365
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,916
So how does it feel?

366
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,250
[TERU]
Huh? Is he unconscious?

367
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,916
What is all this?

368
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,250
What the hell is this power?

369
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,500
What--

370
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,833
[gasps]

371
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,291
[TERU] My powers are being
sucked in by Kageyama...

372
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,875
No, that's not all...

373
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,208
All of the energy
in the atmosphere...

374
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,625
Are you telling me his vessel
is able to handle this much?

375
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,916
[NARRATOR]
Teru sensed something that must

376
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,791
never be touched in there.

377
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:40,208
Something incomparable,
its identity unknown.

378
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,708
[yelps]

379
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,500
[TERU]
You're kidding... What is this?!

380
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,541
What in the world did I awaken?

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
[screaming]

382
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,500
That's enough, I'm sorry!

383
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,625
I won't do it again! Please!

384
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,916
I won't use my psychic powers
against other people!

385
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,541
Oh... I guess...

386
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm just an average
person after all.

387
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,541
[NARRATOR]
It was then that Mob realized:

388
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,625
He failed to change as
he had promised himself.

389
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,583
He caused another accident
because of his psychic powers.

390
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,916
[NARRATOR] He didn't know
where to direct his emotions.

391
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,375
His powerlessness born

392
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,833
from overwhelming
contradictions...

393
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,375
...and the feeling
he would never

394
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,166
be able to conquer himself...

395
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,500
Sadness.

396
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,291
[NARRATOR]
What had just occurred

397
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,833
was Mob's meager attempt
at resisting his inner self.

398
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,208
[MOB]
Hanazawa...

399
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,750
I-I'm sorry about
your clothes an--

400
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,708
[TERU]
W-Wait, Kageyama... I'm... I--

401
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,958
[groans] What happened?
Who won the fight?

402
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,875
Huh? Hey, look! It's Teru!

403
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,208
He's right over there.

404
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,708
Huh? What the hell?

405
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,791
[EDANO screams] He's been
beaten, stripped, and shaved!

406
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,208
[yelps] I'm not gonna let
that happen to my hair!

407
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,833
Those guys...

408
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,500
You saw it, Kageyama.

409
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,541
It's just as you said it was...

410
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,750
Take away our psychic powers,
and we're nothing more than--

411
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,416
[MUSASHI]
Kageyama!

412
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,375
[MOB]
Oh. Hey, guys.

413
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,041
We were worried about you.
You're not hurt, are you?

414
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,333
[MOB]
No, I'm fine. Really.

415
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,208
[MUSASHI]
All right, then. Good to hear.

416
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,375
Now let's all go back
and do some more squats!

417
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,541
[TERU]
There's nothing I can say.

418
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,750
I completely lost.

419
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,958
[NARRATOR] Mob searched
for about three hours,

420
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,583
but he couldn't
find Dimple anywhere.

421
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,708
[MOB]
I'm home.

422
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,500
[sighs]

423
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,333
[RITSU]
Shige?

424
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,958
Glad you're back.
Don't catch a cold.

425
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,833
[MOB]
Thanks.

426
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,583
You're home late today.

427
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,958
Wanna eat?

428
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,291
[MOB]
Nah. I'm gonna get to bed.

429
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,166
You seem kinda down.

430
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,833
Did somethin' happen?

431
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,458
If you wanna talk
about it, I'm here.

432
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,166
Goodnight, then.

433
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,625
[MOB]
Ritsu.

434
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,916
[MOB]
I'm sorry about that one time.

435
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,083
"That one time"?

436
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,791
You mean when you
got super carsick

437
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,791
and threw up into
the hood of my jacket?

438
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:09,166
[MOB] No... Well,
sorry about that, too.

439
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,750
I really can't remember
what happened...

440
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,750
...with that accident
involving my powers.

441
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,041
I've wondered... Back then...

442
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,250
What did I do to you, exactly?

443
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,125
[RITSU] Oh, you mean when
those high school kids

444
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,208
picked a fight with us.

445
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,625
Don't worry, you didn't
do anything to me.

446
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,791
One of the punks kicked
me away and I got hurt.

447
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,666
But you were there
to protect me.

448
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,291
Just forget about it,
it's no big deal.

449
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,291
Goodnight.

450
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,666
[REPORTER 5A] Earlier today,
sometime just after 5 PM,

451
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,000
countless people reported seeing

452
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,208
a supernatural phenomenon
in the stormy skies

453
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,833
above Seasoning City.

454
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,125
Among the rubble,
there were also

455
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,583
reports of what
looked like a person

456
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,125
flying up into the air,
but we have not

457
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,416
been able to confirm...

458
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,916
[RITSU]
Back then...

459
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,083
Ritsu!

460
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,916
[THUG 5B]
You stay out of this, brat!

461
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,083
[grunts]

462
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,541
[RITSU]
Brother!

463
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,541
[REPORTER 5A] The theory
that this was man-made

464
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,833
is gaining traction.

465
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:20,583
[RITSU] That wasn't him.
That wasn't my brother.

466
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,083
[MOB]
I have no appetite.

467
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,750
[RITSU sneezes]

468
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,791
[NARRATOR]
He caught a cold.

469
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,083
[ARATAKA]
His desire for psychic powers

470
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,750
makes Ritsu stray
from the right path.

471
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,000
Having no idea
that was happening,

472
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,791
Mob goes on a carefree
date with Tome.

473
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,208
Come on, Mob. This isn't
the time for that!

474
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,416
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> ,

00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,958
That is the absolute
best decision.

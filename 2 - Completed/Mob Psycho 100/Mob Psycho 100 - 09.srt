1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,708
[KOYAMA] Guess we ran into
more trouble than expected.

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,291
[SAKURAI]
You mean you did.

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:16,583
[KOYAMA] Whatever! You only had
wimpy-looking ones to deal with.

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,291
[SAKURAI] I'm amazed this
one actually managed

5
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,708
to hurt you, Koyama.

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,166
He might get special treatment.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,625
[KOYAMA]
No, it wasn't him.

8
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:27,083
Another guy got in my way,
and he was freakin' tough.

9
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,000
What? You're saying you
encountered another esper?

10
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,333
Yeah.

11
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,208
His psychic abilities were
really strong for a kid.

12
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:36,458
I couldn't match him in power,
so I used your spray.

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,250
[SAKURAI]
And where is that kid?

14
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,708
He wasn't part of the
mission, so I left him.

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,083
[SAKURAI] This is why I didn't
wanna pair up with you.

16
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:44,958
[KOYAMA]
Huh?

17
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,083
What's that?

18
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,333
Though he may not've
been your target,

19
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,000
our orders are to
make abducting kids

20
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,583
with the strongest psychic
powers our top priority!

21
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,166
If the division leader found out
that you messed up like this...

22
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,250
[TERADA laughing]

23
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,166
This all sounds very
interesting, indeed.

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,208
Just fill me in
on the situation.

25
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,625
We'll handle it ourselves.

26
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,250
I'll make sure
the division leader

27
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,833
never hears a peep about this.

28
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,833
[SAKURAI] This is the worst
person to overhear us.

29
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,333
[TERADA LACKEY A]
Pardon me for asking, Terada,

30
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,791
but wouldn't it be better to
bring the other Scars here?

31
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:53,208
No. I'm all that's
needed for this one.

32
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,833
Koyama's an idiot,
but he is powerful.

33
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,125
As an enemy,
that kid'll be a handful.

34
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,166
If he joins us, he'll
likely surpass me,

35
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,916
which is not an option.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,208
So I don't consider
this a mission.

37
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,083
We're just gonna go nip
a little trouble in the bud.

38
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,708
Oh. And this is a
secret, by the way.

39
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,125
Let's say we're gonna
capture him, got it?

40
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,791
[TERADA LACKEY A]
Yes. Understood.

41
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,750
[TERU] What do you
wanna do, Kageyama?

42
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,416
This is a big organization.
Well-run too.

43
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,791
If you ask me,

44
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,708
I think you're going to need
somebody pretty special

45
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,166
on your side for this.

46
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,375
What do you mean?

47
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,833
[TERU] Somebody strong
and extremely smart.

48
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,125
You know, like somebody
right under your nose.

49
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,583
The Body Improvement Club!

50
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,375
Come on. There's no need for
you to play the fool here.

51
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,458
I'm talking about me!
So let's team up for this one.

52
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,708
Yeah? You sure, Hanazawa?

53
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,833
That came from outta
nowhere, didn't it?

54
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,333
[TERU] Look, I'm going
to end up clashing

55
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,916
with Claw again someday.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,416
So I figured
I should do it now

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
while I still have a fighting
chance against them.

58
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,333
And by fighting chance,
I mean you.

59
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,916
You get serious about this,
and there's no way we'd lose.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,083
[DIMPLE]
How can you say that?

61
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,750
We don't even have a
clue where to start.

62
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,166
Please! Let me help, too!

63
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,166
If there's anything
you need, let me know!

64
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,125
[TERU]
That won't be necessary.

65
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,250
I'm confident that
the next attacker

66
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,708
will be here any second.

67
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,750
But that's no good at all!
You should hurry and--

68
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:13,708
[bang]

69
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,791
[DIMPLE]
Hm?

70
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,166
Well, that was quicker
than I thought.

71
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,916
I'm looking for Kageyama.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,291
Now which one of
you would that be?

73
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,583
Let's ask him some questions.

74
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,416
[SAKURAI] Do you think Terada
can win against that kid?

75
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Come on, I'm stronger
than that guy.

76
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,333
That's not what
I'm asking you.

77
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,958
I wanted to know
if he could win.

78
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,583
Well, Terada's always
been cautious.

79
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,875
As strong as that kid was,
he was still only a kid.

80
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,291
If I hadn't let my guard down,

81
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,083
I could've squashed him
from the get-go.

82
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,833
Terada will probably
be fully prepared.

83
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,708
So if you ask me,

84
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,208
that kid's probably gonna go
through some harsh torture.

85
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,333
[screams]

86
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,625
Hurry up and spit it out.

87
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,125
I let my guard down!

88
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,208
He's tired.

89
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,708
Why don't you let him
catch his breath

90
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,583
and relax with a sip of water?

91
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,541
Do you have any idea how
cruel that suggestion is?

92
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,375
You don't have to be nice
to scum like these clowns.

93
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,375
But either way, it seems
like this guy won't talk.

94
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,916
Guess Claw's elite, the Scars,
live up to their name.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
Despite fighting the boss
and ending up with a scar,

96
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,041
their abilities were
acknowledged,

97
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,458
and they became
part of the upper echelon.

98
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,500
And then this guy Terada
heard about the kid

99
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,875
who gave another Scar member,
Koyama, some trouble

100
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,416
and showed up.

101
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,458
Tough break, man. You ended up
being captured and tortured.

102
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,958
Now, if you feel
you're in danger,

103
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,083
tell us what you know, quickly.

104
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,375
I did! I did!

105
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,541
Everything you just said to me

106
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,750
is from the information
that I gave you!

107
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,583
True.

108
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,833
We know about their hideout,

109
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,458
the names, as well
as the abilities,

110
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,166
of all the other Scar members,

111
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,291
and a few other
things on top of that.

112
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,375
Maybe...

113
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,500
But I find it hard to believe

114
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,750
he'd tell us
everything so easily.

115
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,833
[TERADA]
Come on, kid. Gimme a break.

116
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,708
[KOYAMA]
What's the hold up?

117
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:03,791
It's past the time

118
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,291
for our regular upper
echelon meeting,

119
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,916
yet only 7 out of
the 11 are even here.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,333
What a joke.

121
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,416
You've gotta wonder about
Claw's management system.

122
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,541
Terada knew about this
and left anyway.

123
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,375
So he should be fired!

124
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,375
Need I remind you that
you two just showed up?

125
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,166
[MUKAI] He's right. Makes you
about 30 minutes late.

126
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,125
[TAKEUCHI] This group is
comprised of numerous people

127
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,833
who have never worked
well with others.

128
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,583
As long as we do what we need
to do when we need to do it,

129
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,708
it's fine.

130
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,458
Ha! Then I guess
you're out, Koyama.

131
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,750
Heard you got your ass kicked
by a middle-schooler.

132
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,916
I didn't lose. And I
completed my mission.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,458
You really are a simpleton,
you know that?

134
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,041
I suggest you stop
playing around

135
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,208
with these macho games and--

136
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,583
Shut your mouth, fugly!

137
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,333
[TSUCHIYA] I'll kill you,
you pierced chicken.

138
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,833
What?

139
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,458
Koyama. Go and take a seat.
The division leader is here.

140
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,958
[ISHIGURO]
Hope you weren't waiting long.

141
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,708
I just got a message
from the boss.

142
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,083
He's coming back to
Japan next month.

143
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,125
From what I've gathered,

144
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,541
he's going to pick
a couple of you

145
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,916
to be the upper
echelon back at HQ.

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,916
What? Are you serious?

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,583
[ISHIGURO] Yes, but it seems
doubtful he'd pick you,

148
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,625
considering how badly
you messed up today.

149
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,791
[MUTO LACKEY A]
That's right!

150
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,083
Basically, our goal
is world domination.

151
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,625
A skilled hawk can hide its
claws until the last second,

152
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,083
but we're not like that.

153
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,625
We're more like badass hawks
who don't hide our claws!

154
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,375
'Cause of that,
we'll steal all we can,

155
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,875
stand at the top of the world,

156
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,291
and lead humanity into its
rightful and glorious future!

157
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,708
Sound good?
Anyone wanna join us?

158
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,208
Any of you guys?

159
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,416
What morons.

160
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,750
Listen up, you cocky
Natural brats.

161
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,958
I wouldn't underestimate
the power of your trainers,

162
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,250
if I were you.

163
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,708
Remember, you noobs haven't even

164
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,333
been acknowledged
as members yet!

165
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,041
It's not a done deal!

166
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,083
[gasps]

167
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,250
Are you the person
in charge here?

168
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,500
No one in our group
has psychic powers.

169
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,708
This is a big misunderstanding,
so please let us go.

170
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,583
[MUTO] Did you all make
a secret agreement

171
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,625
to act as though you don't
have any psychic powers

172
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,208
in the hopes that
you would be freed?

173
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,291
Very well... You, come out here.

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,375
The younger Shiratori brother.

[MUTO]
You have ten seconds.

177
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,625
Now show me your powers.

178
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,125
Be quick.

179
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,041
[RITSU]
Don't do it.

180
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:30,166
[MUTO]
All right. I understand.

181
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,375
Come. Nobody holds out on me.

182
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,000
[DAICHI]
K-Kaito!

183
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,375
[RITSU] They're gonna try to
brainwash us one by one.

184
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,541
[REI]
Why is this happening?

185
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,750
I just wanna go home!

[KAITO]
Daichi, help!

188
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,708

No... Kaito...

H-He's dead...

[MUTO]
This will happen to all of you.

197
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,041
Take the evening to
reconsider your attitudes.

If you value your
pathetic lives.

[ALL whimering]

200
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,583
[TERU] I see it.
It's that building, right?

201
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,416
Yes. That's it.

202
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,458
[TERADA] These powers can't
be coming from a child.

203
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,791
[yelps]

204
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,041
Okay. We should go the
rest of the way on foot.

205
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,750
Terada's getting away.

206
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,166
[DIMPLE]
Should we go after him?

207
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,791
[TERU]
Hmm...

208
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,375
Considering how
badly we beat him,

209
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,250
I doubt he'll defy us again.

210
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,791
It'd just be a waste of time,

211
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,583
so let's continue on inside
and save your little brother.

212
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,791
Stupid brats.

213
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,875
You'll pay with your
lives for mocking me

214
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,458
and trampling my pride!

215
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,375
Telekinetic control.

00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,208
Air Whips!

00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,666
ith a range of 60 meters,

218
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,291
my powers will display
their true potential

219
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,500
here among the trees!

220
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,791
Kageyama! Are you all right?!

221
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,291
[MOB]
Yeah, but that startled me.

222
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,791
Where'd these trees come from?

223
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,333
[TERU]
It's that Terada guy.

224
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,708
He said he used telekinetic
powers in the shape of whips.

225
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,666
[TERADA]
Say your prayers, brats!

226
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,416
[TERU]
Terada!

227
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,875
If I let you escape me

228
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,750
and infiltrate the
facility like this,

229
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,000
my reputation will be ruined!

230
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,791
I've got you now, punk!

231
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,958
Well, I guess you aren't
so lame after all.

232
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,166
Oh, crap!

233
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,000
My powers are pretty
impressive, huh?

234
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,500
How long can you keep this up?

235
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,916
Kageyama!

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,291
I have to focus on keeping
these trees away from me.

237
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,625
Do something!

238
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,833
[MOB] I guess there're a
lot of ways to use powers.

239
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,958
[TERADA screams]

240
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,875
[sighs]

241
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,500
[TERU] Apparently, in the
face of absolute power,

242
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,916
technique and finesse
don't mean much.

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,750
You were finished
as soon as Kageyama

244
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,041
considered you an enemy.

245
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,833
This battle will
only last one night.

246
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,208
Let's escape.

247
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,666
Come on, man!

248
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,291
You saw what happened! If we
defy them, we're all dead!

249
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,583
Can't stop thinking about it.
Blood everywhere...

250
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,333
Shut up! Just stop it

251
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,541
If they're gonna torture me,
and brainwash me later,

252
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,333
I'd rather risk my life
trying to escape.

253
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,250
Maybe, but Shiratori's still
grieving over his brother.

254
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,833
It'll take him a while
to get over this.

255
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,583
Shiratori, help us
escape from this place.

256
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,250
Have a heart, dude!

257
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,625
Sure. I wanna get
outta here, too.

258
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,958
[TAKESHI]
Uh?

259
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,041
[DAICHI] Apparently,
my younger brother is fine.

260
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,625
We're telepaths, remember?

261
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,958
We can communicate
with each other

262
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,833
even if one of us is far away.

263
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,666
I was talking to him just now.

264
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,208
He said that he was shown a
glimpse of all of our bodies,

265
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,958
bloody and lifeless.

266
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,875
I'm not completely
sure how it works,

267
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,708
but I think that guy
has hypnotic powers

268
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,500
that show us illusions.

269
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,208
Must be how this organization
brainwashes people.

270
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,041
Through fear.

271
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,958
Good thing he chose
to take my brother.

272
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,000
'Cause together we saw
through their tricks.

273
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,000
So he's alive.

274
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,750
Yeah, but that doesn't
change the fact

275
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,750
that these people are dangerous.

276
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,833
And that's exactly why we
need to get out of here.

277
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,541
Let's make our move tonight.

278
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,291
Those trainers still
underestimate us,

279
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,833
and we should take
advantage of that.

280
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,750
Wait. Hey, what're you guys
talking about over there?

281
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,791
They must be workin'
on their escape plan.

282
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,333
Yeah whatever. They're not
gonna go anywhere.

283
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,208
Not the best time
for this, but...

284
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,541
[TAKESHI]
What's wrong?

285
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,375
Well, before I tell you
all of my plans,

286
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,666
I just wanted to know...

287
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,333
Uh...

288
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,125
What're your names again?

289
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,083
For real? Man! You don't
even remember our names?

290
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,625
What's wrong with you?!

291
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,958
You always were hard to read
with that gloomy face of yours.

292
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,083
But that is kinda rude.

293
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,541
[REI]
Now, now...

294
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,875
Let's put that behind us and
introduce ourselves again.

My name is Rei Kurosaki.

And my specialty
is clairvoyance.

297
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,291
Pleasure to work with you.

298
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,416

Go Asahi.

302
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,375
I'm known as the godsend

303
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,875
who's able to burn down
everything in his path.

304
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,666
[RITSU]
By whom, exactly?

305
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,583
I look forward to
working with you.

00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,625
My name is Daichi Shiratori.

307
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,583
Kaito's my little brother who
got taken away from us.

308
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,416
Let's hurry up and rescue Kaito,
then get the hell outta here.

309
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,291
[TAKESHI] But do you have any
kind of plan? We'll need one.

310
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,416
And don't forget, the trainers
are right over there.

311
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,375
[RITSU] I think they already
know we're trying to pull off

312
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,958
some sort of escape.

313
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,916
I'm sure there were other kids
who tried to do the same thing.

314
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,583
That would mean they're used
to dealing with escape attempts.

315
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,083
There goes any chance we had
of leaving this place.

316
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,375
Not necessarily.

317
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,458
If they're still
underestimating our powers,

318
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,916
then we can get outta here.

319
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,625
Really? How?

320
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,541
They probably let their guard
down 'cause we're kids.

321
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,666
They didn't check
our belongings.

322
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,875
A spoon? So do you just
carry that around everywhere?

323
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,583

Oh, it opened.

00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,291
That was easier than I thought.

331
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,333
Well done, brats.
What's your next move? Huh?

332
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,333
Can't wait to hear about it.

333
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,833
Crap. Kageyama? What now?

334
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,250
Let me warn you;
it's safer in that cell.

335
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,833
[MUTO LACKEY B] Take one
step outside of there

336
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,083
and you'll regret it.

00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,333
Kageyama?

338
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,916
You had a plan for
all this, didn't you?

339
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,666
Let's use Hoshino's
super strong telekinesis

340
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,333
and Asahi's fire power
to get outta here.

Uhh...

Listen, man...

You can't move something

00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,125
It's impossible!

00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,916
[GO]
I might be a pyrokinetic genius,

349
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,333
but even I can't set fire to
something that's moving.

350
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,208
Really sorry about this.

351
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,833
I'll take care of it, then.

352
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,208
[ALL]
Huh?

353
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,500
[MUTO LACKEY A] Ha, ha.
You'll all be held responsible.

354
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,875
If you think we're gonna hold
back on you 'cause you're kids,

355
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,083
you're mistaken.

356
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,625
I don't think that.

357
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,333
The three of you are
incompetent, disposable lackeys,

358
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,291
so why would I ever expect
you to have common sense?

359
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,916
[TAKESHI] Y-You're gonna
be killed, Kageyama.

360
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,625
[MUTO LACKEY A]
Oh, I see. Tough guy, huh?

361
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,500
Well, try protecting yourself
with that spoon-bending.

362
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,875
Mr. Natural!

363
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:34,416
[RITSU] Please, powers.
Do as I say. I really need you!

364
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,250
[TAKESHI]
Wh-Whoa... That's crazy!

365
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,750
Guess you didn't even
need us to open the lock.

366
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,541
[RITSU]
No, we needed to show them

367
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,500
that we were limited
in our powers.

368
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,625
This is a blind spot for
that security camera.

369
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,083
Let's have whoever's watching
think we're being disciplined

370
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,375
for a while and go rescue Kaito.

371
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,166
But even with my powers,
I don't know where he is.

372
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,750
Kurosaki.

373
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,375
At this point, we're gonna have
to rely on your clairvoyance.

374
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,333
Huh? My powers?

375
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,625
Can we count on you?

376
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,875
[gasps]

377
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,083
I'll-I'll give it my best.

378
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,833
[BOTH]
Oh... Give me a break...

379
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,916
[DIMPLE]
There're some tough-lookin' guys

380
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,500
by the entrance.

381
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,291
What should we do?

382
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,166
Shigeo, you really need
to think about this.

383
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,500
[TERU]
Wanna blow them away?

384
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,666
[DIMPLE] But we don't know
anything about 'em.

385
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,500
[MOB]
Uh. Umm...

386
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,416
Uh, let's focus
on rescuing Ritsu.

387
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,791
[DIMPLE]
That figures.

388
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:35,916
Okay then.

389
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,666
Oh! What's that technique?

390
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,375
It's the Air Whips.

391
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,000
I figured them out.

392
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,541
[BOTH screaming]

393
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,833
Sorry 'bout that.

394
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,666
[DIMPLE]
I'm not sure if you knew this,

395
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,666
but it's easier to possess
somebody when they're in shock.

396
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,666
[TERU]
You seem used to this, Dimple.

397
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,916
Are you a pretty
dangerous evil spirit?

398
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,083
No, of course not.
Right, Shigeo?

399
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,500
He's totally dangerous.

400
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,708
We might've been better off
if you'd possessed Terada,

401
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,958
'cause then we could've
used of his powers.

402
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,625
[DIMPLE] All espers have
their own mental protection.

403
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,041
As such, it makes it harder for
evil spirits to possess them.

404
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,208
That goes for you guys, too.

405
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,708
Not to mention,

406
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,875
I'm in a lot weaker state of
being than usual right now.

407
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,958
But normally, I'm able
to destroy people's minds

408
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,541
with little effort.

409
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,916
Honestly, you weren't a
big deal before, either.

410
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,208
Don't you get it?!
I was weakened then, too!

411
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,541
But why is that?

412
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,916
Oh, come on! Because
you almost exorcised--

413
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,208
Never mind, forget it.

414
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,541
[TERU]
All right! Let's go!

415
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,041
[RITSU]
Good.

416
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,625
The coast is clear. We're
counting on you, Kurosaki.

417
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,333
We should go this way.

418
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,541
[RITSU]
Let's move.

419
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,375
There, let's keep going.

420
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,458
Right.

421
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,416
Huh? Who're you guys?

422
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,000
[gasps]

423
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,333
[screams]

424
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,375
Easy! Are you
trying to kill him?

425
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,750
I guess we both hit
him at the same time.

426
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,541
Listen up, Kageyama.

427
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,958
Leave all these
lackey-grunts to me, okay?

428
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,750
Now, the first thing
we should do is find out

429
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,208
where they're
holding your brother.

430
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, okay. Sorry...

431
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,208
[TERU] He's so laid back. It's
really starting to throw me off.

432
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,666
Identify yourselves!

433
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,333
[yelping]

434
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,375
You abducted some
kids, didn't you?

435
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,041
Tell us where they are
or you're gonna get it.

436
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,208
Okay, okay. The children
are in the basement.

437
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,416
He said the basement.

438
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,666
There we go. That wasn't
so hard, now was it?

439
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,916
Thank goodness.

440
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,625
[CLAW SECURITY A] You fools.
We can hear you over the radio.

441
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,625
We got intruders.
Go capture 'em.

442
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,291
Hold up. Let's contact
the Scars about this.

443
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,708
You never know,
they might be espers.

444
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,958
[SAKURAI]
An emergency, huh?

445
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,791
[KOYAMA]
It's gotta be him.

446
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,541
That means Terada
got his ass kicked.

447
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,625
First it was Koyama,
and now Terada.

448
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,000
What's goin' on?

449
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,125
Again, I didn't lose to
that little twerp, got it?!

450
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,083
Terada just rushed into
things without thinking.

451
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,125
I'll take care of him this time.

452
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,416
I'm delighted beyond words
to have the opportunity

453
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
to face the little
runt again so soon.

454
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,958
Are you saying we should
leave the intruders to you?

455
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,791
Yes, exactly! Stay outta
my way, you bastards!

456
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,791
Don't rush things. There's more
than one intruder to deal with.

457
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,416
What does that matter?

458
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,916
You're gonna lose again.

459
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,250
Is that so?! You wanna
die first, Sakurai?

460
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,916
Stop it. You're both Scars.

461
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,125
[ISHIGURO]
That plan is fine, Koyama.

462
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,666
Find the intruders.

463
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,708
But you won't get away with
losing to the same person twice.

464
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,500
Yeah, I know.

465
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,958
[TERU] At this point,
we're up against the clock.

466
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,291
Let's split up and
look for your brother.

467
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,041
I'll head off to the right.

468
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,833
Kageyama, you take
the middle. Uh?

469
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,458
Lucky us. It looks like the
mini boss just showed up.

470
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,083
This guy again? Ah, great.

471
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,916
[KOYAMA]
We meet once more.

472
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,750
I beat the crap outta you,
and you can already move?

473
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,708
Well, I'm glad you're
doin' all right.

474
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,833
I'll kill you this
time, for sure.

475
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,875
And the rest of you.

476
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,625
Now let's both hit him together
with our full powers!

477
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,583
We don't have time for all that.

478
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,000
[KOYAMA]
Oh, yeah? Is that so?

479
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,125
What, are you tryin' to reserve
your stamina or somethin'?

480
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,916
You're gonna have to face me.

481
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,041
[laughing]

482
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,250
[KOYAMA]
Now die!

483
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,416
He's coming! Uh?

484
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,833
[KOYAMA]
What...? What's happening?

485
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,791
I can't move a finger.

486
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,875
[KOYAMA screams]

487
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,791
[MOB] Sorry. Didn't think
about that being so noisy.

488
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,375
I see.

489
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,791
You meant that you didn't have
time to try to hold back on him.

490
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,750
[TERU] Didn't expect
that from Kageyama.

491
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,875
[SAKURAI]
Koyama's not responding.

492
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,916
We're dealing with
someone powerful here.

493
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,333
Ha! How pathetic.

494
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,750
Let's go.

495
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,416
It's time to show
these intruders

496
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,708
the true terror of Claw.

497
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,875
[ARATAKA]
Mob infiltrates Claw's hideout

498
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,375
along with Teru
and all of his hair,

499
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,791
and the body-possessing Dimple.

500
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,083
They end up facing the Scars,
who refuse to hold back.

501
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,125
Think you can win this, Mob?

502
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,666
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> ,

503
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,208
Episode 10: "The Heinous
Aura Mastermind."

504
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,000
Option C involves Blu-rays,
manga volumes, and events!

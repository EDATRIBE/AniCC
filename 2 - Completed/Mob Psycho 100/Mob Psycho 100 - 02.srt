[NARRATOR]
In one's life, the second year

5
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,958
of middle school kicks off
a most sensitive time.

6
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,875
It is commonly
known as adolescence.

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,041
Some thrive in athletics.

8
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,333
Some work hard on their studies.

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,916
Some devote themselves
to their hobbies.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,333
Some polish their talents.

11
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,958
Some rebel.

12
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,000
While some fall for
the opposite sex,

13
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:42,000
tasting bittersweet, and
sometimes unrequited, love.

14
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,791
All those youthful desires form

15
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,166
the amalgamation
that is adolescence.

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,125
And, what was Mob doing
during this precious time?

17
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:54,625
Working as an assistant for
a psychic at 300 yen an hour.

18
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,833
The reason for your
curse is porn sites!

19
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,125
Wait a second. Porn sites?

20
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,583
Yes!

21
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,958
The jinx you carry on your
shoulders is a terrible one,

22
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,916
commonly referred to
as the One-Click Curse!

[CLIENT 2A]
A-A one-click curse contracted

24
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,000
from web porn?

25
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,500
They use illegal,
18-plus sites to curse

26
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,666
your shoulders while also
burdening you with their fees.

27
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,833
Nowadays, even
supernatural curses

28
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:54,666
are being digitized.

Get real!

00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,708
Who in the hell would believe
that giant tub of hogwash?

31
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,958
Relax and keep perfectly still.
I'll lift the curse right now.

34
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,750
Your right shoulder is stiff.

35
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,708
The curse really
has a hold on you.

36
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,166
If you think I'm
payin' for this,

37
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,750
you've got another thing coming!

What the--?

40
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,666
It actually feels pretty good!

[NARRATOR] This is one
of Reigen's special moves.

45
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,791
He relieves the stress
from physical fatigue,

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,708
and gets rid of stiff
shoulders and back pain.

47
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,041
[sighs]

48
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,458
I believe that I was
able to lift the curse.

49
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,125
Do your shoulders
still feel heavy?

50
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,083
No! I'm sorry that
I doubted you.

51
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,833
Everything feels so much better!

52
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,958
May I come again
for a follow-up?

53
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,958
That'd be no problem!

54
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,208
Let's see...

55
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,500
The fee for a 40-minute
massage is 3,800 yen.

56
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,458
[ARATAKA] Idiot! Don't
call it a massage fee!

57
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,500
Call it the
"curse-dispelling" fee!

58
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,916
[MOB]
Two hundred yen is your change.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,041
[ARATAKA]
Hey, here you go, Mob.

60
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,291
Feelin' kinda hungry?

61
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,458
Yes. Thanks for the food.

62
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,791
Master Reigen, you're
getting much better

63
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,333
at these massages, lately.

64
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,583
Well, yeah.

65
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,125
I've been tryin' different
things to improve,

66
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,041
like reading up on
some new techniques.

67
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:15,333
'Course, it's only effective
'cause of my spiritual power.

68
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,791
Hot!

69
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,208
Such a waste!

70
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,791
Master, I...

71
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,916
I've been thinking
about something...

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,916
Well, this is a rare occasion.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,666
You don't start conversations.

74
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,208
[MOB]
Well...

75
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,791
I can use a little ESP, and I'm
different from other people,

76
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,750
so I came to discuss
that with you

77
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,208
and then I ended up
becoming your student.

78
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,125
At the time, I didn't
have anybody else

79
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,375
to talk to, so I was
and am grateful...

80
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:47,291
Because you teach me things,
and pay me on top of it all.

81
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,250
However, I wonder...

82
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,083
Is this really okay?

83
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,875
That's what's been on my mind.

84
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,875
[ARATAKA]
Does he think his pay's too low?

85
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,333
Or did he finally figure
out that I'm a fraud?

86
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,041
What do you mean exactly?

87
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,916
How do I put this...

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,333
Rather than waste my youth
working after school,

89
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,125
I have this sneaking suspicion
that there are other things

90
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,166
I should be experiencing
in my life.

91
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,083
Huh?!

92
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,958
Ah, so that's what
you're talkin' about!

93
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,250
Puberty! An important
phase in one's life.

94
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,625
Is there something specific
you wanna do right now?

95
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,791
Be in a band? Dance?

96
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,541
Hitchhike across the country?

97
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,875
No, I don't have anything
particular in mind.

98
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,291
Okay. Listen, Mob.

99
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,666
I understand what
you're going through,

100
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,750
but there's no need
to rush into things.

101
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,791
In my opinion,
the Going-Home Club

102
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,041
is what's best.

103
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,500
You're goofin' off
during the period

104
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,375
of your life you can
goof off the most,

105
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,625
and that makes you
a winner in my book.

106
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,750
So, I say, just keep
on bein' a slacker

107
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,000
and make money off me. Ya know?

This isn't good.

A club's supposed have
five or more members, right?

116
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,250
So what should we
do now, President?

117
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,375
There's only one
thing we can do.

00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,375

00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,333
Creepy.

Nope.

182
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:02,166
Forget it.

183
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,041
Uh, no.

[STUDENT 2P]
Sounds lame. No.

185
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,375
Guess it really is impossible

186
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,833
to find new members
this time of year.

187
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,666
Not to mention we keep
getting called "creepy."

188
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,416
Now even I wanna quit.

00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,083
I found him!

196
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,333
He's not in any
clubs or committees,

197
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,041
and he doesn't have any
friends or girlfriends.

Shigeo Kageyama of

Well, I'd say he's
basically right.

Well done, Inukawa!

what a coincidence!

Wait just a second, Mob!

Exorcism? What is that
supposed to mean?

Ah! President!

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,041
I just remembered something!

00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,375
This guy was sort of famous
back in grade school!

225
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,541
He could bend spoons
and make erasers move.

You know, like telekinesis!

227

In other words, he's an esper!

00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,375
Stop being such a weirdo
and just join our club.

229

a little while, right?

Is it okay if I'm a little late?

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,916
Just join and leave,
what's the big deal.

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,375
No, I have to wait until
the student council meeting

237
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,916
is over, then go submit
my club admission form.

238

Wait.

239
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,500
So if I told you to come
to work immediately,

240
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,041
you'd end up not joining?

241
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,291
Uh, yeah, but...

242
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,208

the promise I made

243
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,708
to the others first?

00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,583

He's not really the type to
play any kind of sports stuff.

255
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,833
Probably isn't a good
idea to force him.

stupid sports club!

Huh? You're kidding me.

It's a club where we train
to feel telepathic powers.

You know exactly what
I'm talking about!

I've heard from a reliable
source that Kageyama

265
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,125
has telekinesis and ESP!

266
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,166
I bet you're just
using him to solve cases

267
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,708
and get more customers
'cause you can't do it

join after all.

and friendship...

It's not like any
of those things

a club is abolished.

They're using you!

00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,875
Trust me, they just don't
wanna lose their room,

00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,041
their budget,

287
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,875
and their pointless
after-school time,

288
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,291
judging from what their
club sounds like to me.

289
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,166
See through it, Mob!

290
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,875
If that shady club goes down,

291
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,708
it's because it was damn
well meant to go down.

292

hurry up and come to work!

00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,541
Now listen, the
president seriously

believes in telepathy
and all that stuff,

300
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,875
but honestly,
the rest of us here

301
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,166
just wanna lie
around and goof off.

302
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,791
Right now, we're
in middle school.

This is the only time
we're gonna be able

304
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,833
to do nothing and
get away with it!

created! What do ya say?

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,416
You're not gonna find a more
carefree club than this.

308
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,666
We have until tomorrow
to set things straight,

309
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,875
so think it over?

310
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,375
You're our last hope, Kageyama!

311
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,708
Save us!

Mm...

313
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,583
[ARATAKA] So I assume you
turned them down, didn't ya?

314
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,625
Nuh-uh. I figured I'd take
a night to think about it.

315
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,666
[ARATAKA] You shouldn't
drag these things out, Mob.

316
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,000
[WOMAN 2A] I know, I couldn't
believe it myself when he--

317
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,875
You need to turn down
things you don't wanna do.

318
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,541
[MOB] Right now, the thing
I least wanna do...

319
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,416
,..is to be dressed
up like this.

320
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,916
Oh, there it is.

321
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,666
Saint Highso Girls' Academy.

322
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,916
It's a private
all-girls high school.

323
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,500
And, the clients
have asked us both

324
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,041
to meet up with
them on the roof.

325
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,375
Right.

00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,000
Stop! What in the world
do you think you're doing?

327
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:46,750
[ARATAKA]
Excuse me?

328
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,916
You heard what I said!

329
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,166
Don't play dumb!

330
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,166
Oh, I'm just a student
here on my way to class.

331
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,541
Reporting from the front gate.

332
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,041
Suspicious individual here!

333
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,416
Requesting backup!

334
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,208
That's kinda mean, isn't it?

335
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,208
[OFFICER 2B]
Can it, you perverted weirdo!

336
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,666
I knew this wouldn't work.

337
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,000
But I'm glad they saw
through our disguises.

338
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,333
I didn't wanna sneak into
the school dressed like this.

339
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,083
[OFFICER 2B]
That was a close one, huh?

340
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,416
Now hurry along and stay
away from that freak.

341
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,041
Huh?

342
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,958
[OFFICER 2A] Don't you worry.
We'll deal with this phony.

343
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,458
[MOB]
Uh...

344
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,041
Huh?

345
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,958
[MOB]
What am I doing?

346
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,583
Won't I get in a lot of
trouble if I'm busted?

347
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,291
[MOB] He said we were
supposed to meet our clients

348
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,750
on the roof, but...

349
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,083

Um, hello?

00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,958
I've come from the

--Huh?
--[GIRL 2C] Consultation office?

You're here to see if
you can "get through"

00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,083
to us thugs, is that it?

358
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,375
So annoying!

Do you really think
we're just gonna sit here

360
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,333
and let some twerp

Sorry about that. My bad.

Ugh. Talk about a downer.

First thing you do is
get picked on by thugs.

00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,458
Way to go.

372
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,875
We're the clients you're
here to meet with.

[CHIHIRO]
Isn't that Reigen guy coming?

374
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,333
He got caught up
at the front gate.

375
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,750
[MARI] Also, you both
came dressed as girls?

376

Really?

377
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,041
He couldn't get
permission to come in,

378
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,583
so we didn't have a choice.

379
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,791
[MARI]
I see.

380
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,625
We're sorry to make you
go through all that.

381
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,708
The school just refuses
to take us seriously

382
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,708
about any of this
supernatural stuff.

383
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,291
So that's why we called you.

384
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,750
What exactly was it
that you told them?

385
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,500
[MARI] Students' belongings
are mysteriously vanishing,

386
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,375
and we've been
hearing weird noises.

387
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,583
[CHIHIRO] Like, a
poltergeist or something.

388
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,875
[MARI] We heard things
have been spotted

389
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,791
floating through the air, too.

390
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,916
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah.

391
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,625
Apparently a bra
started floating around

392
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,750
in the locker room.

393
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,291

A bra?

394
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,375
We're sure it's not just
kids playing pranks.

395
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,041
It's definitely supernatural.

396
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,666
So we went online,
looked around,

397
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,791
then called the cheapest
exorcist in the area

398
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,833
and somehow ended up with you.

399
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,333
Looks like you get
what you pay for.

400
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,541
Huh?

401
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,458
Can't believe a guy
was trembling so much

402
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,458
just from dealing with
some high school girls.

403
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,958

Oh... Thank you.

That was sarcasm, duh!

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,791
She wasn't complimenting you!

407
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,250
[MARI] Are you sure we
can trust him with this?

408
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,416
[CHIHIRO] I have my doubts.
You seem pretty unreliable.

00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,958
What's up?

410
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,208

00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,333
I just have to
perform an exorcism.

413
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,541
[MARI] Now, let us know if
you feel anything spiritual.

Well? Do you sense anything?

00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,500
Maybe a little.

Is he being serious right now?

418
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,791

Something was just looking in
from the top of the door...

The windows are locked tight.

00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:19,250
And we would've seen if somebody
tried to leave through the exit.

428

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,333
[TOKUGAWA]
Any hobbies?

527
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,583
[MOB]
I, uh...

528
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,791
Don't you have anything
at all you want to do?

529
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,041
Huh?

530
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,666
If you let these
students goad you

531
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,041
into joining while having
no interest at all,

532
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,166
what exactly will
you gain from it?

533
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,500
Well, uh...

534
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,750
All I wanna do is live
every day to the fullest.

535
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,833
[TOKUGAWA] Will wasting time
after school with soda,

536
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:40,916
snacks, and video games

537
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,041
help you "live every day
to the fullest"?

538
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,500
If you want to join this club
of your own free will, go ahead.

539
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,458
However, you should carefully
think this through.

540
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,875
What is it you really
want to do with your life?

541
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,166
[MOB]
What I wanna do...

542
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,791
Do I have anything I wanna do?

543
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,125
Does everyone else
have something?

544
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,625
Something enjoyable?
Something I'm envious of?

545
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,708
What are they enjoying?

546
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,166
Clubs, hobbies, studying?

547
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,791
Now that I think about it,
hanging out with girls

548
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,625
might be fun.

549
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,625
[MOB gasps]

550
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,166
[MOB]
I did have a dream!

551
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,916
I wanted to confess my
feelings to my first love,

552
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,625
Tsubomi, and hold hands
as we walked home.

553
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,291
[MOB]
Take a look, Tsubomi!

554
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,916
When you make frogs float,
they start swimming.

555
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,500
Oh, wow! That's so cute.

556
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,708
[MOB] I can make the bar
all squishy, too.

557
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,250
[TSUBOMI gasps]
You're amazing, Mob!

558
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,500
[MOB]
Look!

559
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,833
I'm only showing you
these things, Tsubomi!

560
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,833
[sighs] I'm getting bored.

561
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,125

562
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,250

The red team can move!

564
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,666
You're fast, Akira!

565
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,875
[MOB]
That's it...

566
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,125
If I can change anything
by joining a club...

567
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,833
...then I'm gonna join!

568
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:06,583
Thank you for having me,
Body Improvement Club!

569
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,250
Wait, what'd you say?

570
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,750
Huh?

571
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,750
[MUSASHI]
Welcome aboard! Good to have ya!

Thank you!

[ANCHOR 2A]
Unable to locate the whereabouts

574
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,875
of the suspicious
individual who infiltrated

575
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,083
an all-girls' school
by crossdressing,

576
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,375
the whole area
is on high alert...

577
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,500
[ARATAKA]
Hot!

578
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,333
[ARATAKA] Mob joins the
Body Improvement Club.

579
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,250
On his way home, in an
attempt to be popular,

580
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,333
he goes to the main temple

581
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,000
of an obviously
shady-looking cult.

582
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,125
Are you sure about this, Mob?

583
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,500
Next time, on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> ,

584
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,041
Episode 3:
"An Invite to a Meeting

585
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,625
Simply Put, I Just
Want to be Popular."

586
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,916
Recording it? That's also
a wise decision.

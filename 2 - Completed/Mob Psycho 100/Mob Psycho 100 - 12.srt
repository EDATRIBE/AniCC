1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,041
[ISHIGURO] All four of
you are going to hell.

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,625
Shige, you're the only one
of us who can stop them!

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,625
[TERU] Kageyama!
Use all of your powers!

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,750
[MOB]
I can't just let them die.

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,708
I have no choice but to
fight with all I've got.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,791
I'm warning you. Don't do it.

7
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,250
When things go south,

8
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,291
it's okay to run away
and save yourself!

9
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:32,875
[gasps]

10
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:40,000
[TERU] Damn it! I can't
believe this is happening.

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,291
[RITSU]
R-Reigen... He's--

12
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,958
This isn't good.

13
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,333
Stress is about to hit my
brother like a tidal wave.

14
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,375
There's no telling
what'll happen!

15
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,625
[MOB]
Honestly.

16
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,916
I really don't
wanna hurt people.

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,833
But if I don't,
we're going to be killed.

18
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,666
So I'm kinda stuck.

19
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,583
I realize that to protect
everyone, I've gotta do it.

20
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,875
Guess that pretty
much sums things up.

21
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,791
Brother...

22
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,125
And yet.

23
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:48,250
My master told me that
it was okay to run away.

24
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,541
So...

25
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:53,791
[ARATAKA sighs]

26
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,958
[ALL gasp]

27
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,958
No... Impossible...

28
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,666
Hey, don't scare me like that!

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,458
I thought you actually
cut me for a second.

30
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,750
[RITSU] How is he standing?
He was sliced hard!

31
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,708
[ARATAKA] I know you said
that katana was just a toy,

32
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,791
but you really
had me goin' there.

33
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,458
It's nothin' but plastic.

34
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,000
[chuckles]

35
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,125
Pretty sneaky.

36
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,583
Tell me, what kinda
trick did you use

37
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,625
to cut the floor earlier?

38
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,583
[TERU]
Hey, what's going on?

39
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,000
[RITSU] He's acting
like he usually does.

40
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,541
Bastard. How 'bout I just
chop your damn head off?!

41
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,125
[ARATAKA]
Ow!

42
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:31,375
Listen, real adults don't have
time to play with toy swords

43
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,416
It's time to grow up!

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,875
[gasps]

45
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,250
[TERU]
Huh...

46
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,208
Guess I understand how he's
Kageyama's Master now.

47
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,125
[MATSUO]
Sakurai, move!

48
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,250
Candy, attack!

49
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,333
[roaring]

50
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,083
Whoa! An evil spirit?

51
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,166
Hey! Mob! Do something.

52
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,791
That's it?
What a weak-ass punch.

53
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,416
Are you a plushie?

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,208
[MATSUO]
Huh?

55
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,000
Eat fist, mascot!

56
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,791
[ARATAKA] Oh, sorry! I didn't
mean to shred your costume!

57
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,166
[RITSU] Reigen is
actually the real deal?

58
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,833
Don't get cocky.

59
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,958
Oh, crap! He's surrounded!

60
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,833
[ARATAKA]
Huh? What was that all about?

61
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,541
Some kinda new 3D
imagery or something?

62
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,083
What was the point?

63
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,333
[MURAKI]
He nullified all of them?

64
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,583
Is he some kind of monster?

65
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,208
[ISHIGURO]
How can this be?

66
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:38,000
Someone who's this skilled
still exists in this world?

67
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,500
He must be eliminated.

68
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,750
He can't get in the way
of our global domination.

69
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,250
Huh? Oh, I see.

70
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,583
You were using some
kinda magic trick, too.

71
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,375
You guys are total frauds.

72
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,333
Just try that thing with
the black orbs again.

73
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,333
[RITSU]
There's a lot!

74
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,916
[TERU]
Is he gonna be okay?

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,208
Leave this to the adult here.

76
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,416
[ARATAKA]
Wow! I'm in great shape today!

77
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,166
[MOB]
Master really is amazing.

78
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,375
[NARRATOR]
"It's okay to run away."

79
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,291
As soon as he heard those words,

80
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,291
the explosive amount of energy
building up to a critical level

81
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,791
within Mob changed
its direction.

82
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:20,500
There are times when the power
of one's words are unfathomable.

83
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,458
Those with power must
choose to fight.

84
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,041
The thought of
that responsibility

85
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,916
made Mob's bridge collapse.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,208
But sometimes,

87
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,541
one's heart can find
the resolution it needs

88
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,083
just by getting a helping hand.

89
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,625
As a result,
all of Mob's energy

90
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,125
was temporarily tossed
over to Reigen.

91
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,375
In essence, he'd
successfully run away

92
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,958
and was feeling calm
and refreshed.

93
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,333
All that was left in
his heart was gratitude

94
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,916
towards his wise master.

95
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,708
Are these soap bubbles?

96
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,333
[ISHIGURO]
My Black Orbs...

97
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:07,250
They swallow up and destroy
anything they touch.

98
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,250
And this man is swatting them
away with his bare hands.

99
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,583
How?

100
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,500
What happened to the man
who was trying to run away

101
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,791
just a moment ago?

102
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,125
I'll have to put my body
on the line, too.

103
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,791
Five Hundred Kilogram Tackle!

104
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,541
[ISHIGURO]
One Ton Punch!

105
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,000
[ISHIGURO]
Two Ton Guillotine!

106
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,541
[ISHIGURO] You still conscious?
Didn't think so.

107
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,125
No matter how powerful
an esper you are,

108
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,791
you still fall short
of excellence.

109
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,541
You have no desire
for domination.

110
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,875
The reason you're so
powerful yet so unknown

111
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,708
is because you're hiding
your true abilities.

112
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,291
Well, I am different!

113
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,125
I am filled with ambition!

114
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,916
And I'll use my powers
to go higher and higher,

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,125
and hold this world in--

116
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,875
Get up. Nobody wants
to hear you monologue.

117
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,000
[gasps]

118
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,708
[ARATAKA]
What a dense energy barrier!

119
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,208
Now I see what happened.

120
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,125
The reason my Black
Orbs burst earlier

121
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,041
was because the energy
they were trying to take in

122
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,458
was way over their limit!

123
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,208
Inconceivable.
Who in the world are y--?

124
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,708
[ARATAKA]
Where are your manners?

125
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,583
When speaking to someone,
you should take off your mask!

126
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,750
Head's up!

127
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,583
Oh, guess it came off.

128
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,375
Anyway, what's with
all this strength?

129
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,166
Could it be Mob's doing?

130
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,708
That's the only
plausible explanation.

131
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:53,791
[gasps]

132
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:00,708
Listen, somebody your age should
stop messing around with toys.

133
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,416
What could you possibly know?!

134
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,750
To hell with that!

135
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,166
Don't try and lecture me
about my place in society

136
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,625
when you've only
seen its good side!

137
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,875
When I was born,
my parents abandoned me.

138
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,458
I was all alone.

139
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,833
A big happy family?
Mother's cooking?

140
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,166
I got to experience
none of that as a boy.

141
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,875
At the orphanage, I was
bullied relentlessly.

142
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,625
I cursed the world!

143
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,541
If I hadn't, I wouldn't
have survived!

144
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,083
All that rage and resentment
helped awaken my powers,

145
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,125
and I was able to get
by because of them!

146
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,000
Anyone who rejects my way
of living can just-- Uh!

147
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,708
What's with that face?
Don't look at me like that!

148
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,458
You and I...
we're like brothers.

149
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,666
[SAKURAI]
Wait... He's the same as me?

150
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,541
[ARATAKA] Back when
I was in grade school...

151
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,875
...maybe it was
around fourth grade...

152
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,875
I forgot to tell my parents that
it was sports day at school,

153
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,208
so I was the only one
with nothing to eat.

154
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,041
Sure, that's sad, but
you did it to yourself.

155
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,416
Why bring it up now?

156
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,083
To show our bond of feeling
lonely at times as boys.

157
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,541
[growls]

158
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,291
Don't compare that
stupid story to mine!

159
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,916
Jugan Air Gun!

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,458
Behold the ultimate
weapon of destruction.

161
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,541
Die!

162
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,208
If all else fails, I can
still put you to sleep

163
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,666
with this cursed cologne!

164
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,250
[ARATAKA]
Hm?

165
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,333
I don't really get it, but don't
point or spray that at others.

166
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,666
Gimme that.

167
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,333
Huh?

168
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,791
Come on, seriously?
This crap again?

169
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,291
You have all these
psychic powers

170
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,083
and you use them
to do stuff like this?

171
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,250
What a waste.

172
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,416
What'd you say?

173
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,208
[ARATAKA]
It's like you're a little kid

174
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,208
with a knife or something.

175
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,833
I can't bear to watch.

176
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,625
Who do you think you are?

177
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,625
[ARATAKA] What's with all
that stuff on your forehead?

178
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,708
What?! That's, uh--

179
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,500
It's nothing.
You wouldn't get it.

180
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,166
[ARATAKA] And what's with
these goofy things

181
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,041
that look like shoulder pads?

182
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,291
Well, uh-- Those are there
to guard my shoulders.

183
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,500
[ARATAKA] Yeah.
They're fashion accessories.

184
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,583
They don't serve
any real purpose.

185
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,625
[RITSU]
Huh?

186
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,708
[grunts]

187
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,125
[ARATAKA]
You guys just don't get it.

188
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,958
No matter what kind of
special powers you may have,

189
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,291
you're still only human.

190
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,416
No more and no less.
It's the same for everybody.

191
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,708
But somehow, you've
all forgotten that.

192
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,458
You're so addicted to
your special powers,

193
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,083
you've developed tunnel vision.

194
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,250
You want world domination,
but you haven't seen the world!

195
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,458
No one's gonna
follow you knowing that!

196
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,041
Don't make me laugh!

197
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,208
First, get rid of those
ridiculous shoulder pads

198
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,708
and grow up!

199
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,000
You, too! You just wanna
escape from society, right?

200
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,750
If you hope to make it big,
you have to live in reality!

201
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,208
Consider that the
starting point!

202
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,666
You're telling us to
return to being commoners?

203
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,500
What? No way!
You're not getting it!

204
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,250
Why don't you understand this?!

205
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,583
Think about who the hell
you are for a second!

206
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,583
You've always been a commoner!
A cog in the population!

207
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,375
But Claw only allows
the elite espers to--

208
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,083
[ARATAKA]
Look, I'm a commoner!

209
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,333
And I'm much more powerful
than any of you will ever be!

210
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,958
So tell me! What the hell
does that make you?!

211
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,500
[RITSU] He dragged them
out of their delusions

212
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,166
and back into reality.

213
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,208
Shattering their dreams
and putting them in their place.

214
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,208
Your master's amazing!

215
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,250
Yep!

216
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,333
[ISHIGURO]
No!

217
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,125
That is absolutely false!

218
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,541
[ALL gasp]

219
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,833
It's the division leader's face.
Is he really that old?

220
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,791
I actually thought he was
a girl this whole time...

221
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,458
I reject your claims
that deny our greatness!

222
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,791
"You're only human.

223
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,041
No more and no less.
The same as everyone else."

224
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,625
That is what you said, right?

225
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,208
Yeah.

226
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,000
[ISHIGURO] It's not true! And
it's cruel to even suggest it!

227
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,583
We are superior lifeforms to the
rest of the dregs of humanity!

228
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,333
Our powers make us elite!

229
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,916
I'm sure you convinced
yourself of that to go on,

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,416
but the truth of the matter is

231
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,250
society really doesn't
care about you either way.

232
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,125
"Society, blah, blah, blah."

233
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,083
No group of average
people is big enough

234
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,208
for a god-among-men like me!

235
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,375
You rely too much on these
espers you've recruited.

236
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,791
The more I think about it,
the sadder I get.

237
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,166
[ISHIGURO] I was born with
these powers, understand?

238
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,583
So what's the problem with
me showing them off?!

239
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,041
What's wrong with
changing the world?!

240
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,666
Stupid ape!

241
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,458
That's how I see you.
No different from a monkey!

242
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,125
It's hard to live!

243
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,333
Surviving's a chore, even
though I'm so special!

244
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,666
It's obvious I'm amazing.

245
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,458
Why won't you just
acknowledge that?

246
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,958
I'm a gift!

247
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,166
This planet should put me
on a pedestal and worship me!

248
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,291
That is the only world
that is worthy of me!

249
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:28,125
Wrong. Having psychic powers
doesn't make you popular.

250
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,666
See? There you have it.

251
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,333
You'll never be popular.
So give it up.

252
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,041
[growls]

253
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,500
I'm going to erase you all...

254
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:41,125
Erase this whole building
and start over!

255
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,541
[ARATAKA] Crap.
Looks like I'm outta gas.

256
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,708
Mob, lend me your powers again.

257
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,000
Actually, I'm kinda
tapped out right now.

258
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,166
[ARATAKA yelping]

259
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,833
[ARATAKA]
Oh, no! We're being sucked in!

260
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,791
Disappear! Disappear! Disappear!

261
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,000
You just don't know
when to quit.

262
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,375
Hey, that's--

263
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,833
[ISHIGURO]
Damn it!

264
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,666
I've got enough for you, too!

265
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,208
Disappear!

266
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,833
[SHO] A mass of gravity,
huh? Interesting.

267
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,958
Imagine the gravity
going backward.

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,291
[SHO]
As neat as that power is,

269
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,250
that wasn't an
actual black hole.

270
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,250
If it's conceived
from psychic powers,

271
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:28,041
I can always find a
way to deal with it.

272
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,750
Sorry, Gramps.

273
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,833
But you're no longer needed.

274
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,875
[SHO]
And as for you...

275
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,291
Listen up.

276
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:43,416
I'm disappointed in you.
You coward.

277
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,041
The 7th Division
will be dissolved.

278
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,625
I was ordered to
inspect the place

279
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,208
and take anyone who seemed
useful back with me to HQ.

280
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,291
What're you talking about?

281
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,750
Weren't you a trainee?

282
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,541
[SHO] Sadly, there wasn't
anyone worth bothering with.

283
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,750
At least... not on the inside.

284
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,833
Well, see ya!

285
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,458
[MATSUO chuckles]

286
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,458
[MATSUO] The evil spirits have
been whittled down to one.

287
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,250
The poison jar has
finally been completed!

288
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,625
Matsuo. We're finished here.

289
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,125
Come out, Marshmallow! Be free!

290
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,500
[sighs]

291
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:24,750
The hell is that?

292
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,708
Dimple!

293
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,666
I was finally able to get out.

294
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,208
[burps]

295
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,291
[DIMPLE]
All right!

296
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,625
Now that I've consumed
those spirits

297
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,500
and regained some of my
strength, I can help here!

298
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,708
[MOB]
It's already done.

299
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,875
[DIMPLE]
Huh?

300
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,000
You mean the climax
happened without me?

301
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,375
Is this an evil spirit?

302
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,458
[DIMPLE]
Whoa!

303
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,708
How is it that you're
able to see me

304
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,041
when I'm not in
my visible mode?!

305
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,416
They're really strong.

306
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,291
[SAKURAI]
No.

307
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,791
We're weak, plain and simple.

308
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,583
Which leads me to this.

309
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,625
I've realized those guys just
might be able to do it:

310
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,250
Stop Claw from world domination.

311
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,916
[TSUBOMI]
Really? Let me see.

312
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,458
[STUDENT A]
Check it out!

313
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,791
Oh, that looks great!
Let's all go together!

314
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,416
[MOB]
Ah... Tsubomi...

315
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,958
She's as cute as ever today.

316
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:45,958
[TSUBOMI]
Huh?

317
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,250
[MOB]
Our eyes met!

318
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,541
Stare much, creeper?

319
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,250
Ah! Mezato!

320
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,000
You are such a spaz.

321
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,333
Look, staring at girls
is all well and good,

322
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,416
but today is the day that
you're going to talk to me.

323
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,208
[MOB] The Body
Improvement Club's today.

324
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,333
Fine, I'll just wait for you.

325
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,458
But I've got my job after that.

326
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,750
[MEZATO]
Ugh!

327
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,291
Come on, when're you
gonna tell me everything?

328
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,083
[SHINJI] Your older brother
came by my place last night.

329
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,166
Huh? What did he want?

330
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,666
You must've been
through quite a lot, too.

331
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,166
I think we both
went a little crazy.

332
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,708
I'm done. I'm gonna
apologize to Onigawara.

333
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,208
I'll go with you.

334
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,166
But are you sure about this?

335
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,333
I mean, the entire student
body's gonna hate you.

336
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,708
[SHINJI]
Probably.

337
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,250
But that's my fault for doing
something so stupid.

338
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,708
And now, my brother's on my
side, so I'll keep in line.

339
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,416
It'll be tough,
but it's for the best.

340
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,041
[ONIGAWARA]
What?

341
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,875
So it was you guys who
planted the recorders on me.

342
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,833
That was a crappy thing to do.

343
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,291
And I knew anyway, so it's
not like it really matters now.

344
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,166
Huh?

345
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,916
Wait, what do you mean by that?

346
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,291
[ONIGAWARA]
I mean that people didn't care

347
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,750
whether I was actually
the culprit or not.

348
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,583
They were chomping at
the bit to come at me,

349
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,500
a chance to kick me out.

350
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,708
That's where the problem was.

351
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,666
I realized that I was
hated by everyone,

352
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,250
and how weak my heart was.

353
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,958
It's not the best feeling
in the world, let me tell ya.

354
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,000
Hey.

355
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,208
[RITSU]
Uh?

356
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,416
Your brother was worried
about you, you know.

357
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,916
He thought I was
gonna kick your ass

358
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,541
since I was so pissed off.

359
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,875
But I'll let things slide

360
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,208
since you're the shadow
leader's younger brother.

361
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,833
What's wrong, Onigawara?

362
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,583
You out of energy back there?

363
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,750
Just gimme a damn minute!

364
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,041
I'm still gonna grow,

365
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,000
just like White T
Poison did before me.

366
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,291
[ONIGAWARA]
Body Transformation! Fight!

367
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,000
[STUDENTS]
On!

368
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:34,625
[ONIGAWARA]
Fight!

369
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:35,333
[STUDENTS]
On!

370
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:35,958
[ONIGAWARA]
Fight!

371
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,625
[STUDENTS]
On!

372
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,916
[MOB panting]

373
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,875
[RITSU]
Uh?

374
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,125
That's your older
brother, isn't it?

375
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,750
Is he okay? Seems like
he's about to pass out.

376
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,291
Yeah.

377
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,375
'Cause despite how he might
look, my brother is strong.

378
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,000
Stronger than anybody else.

379
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,583
[SHINJI]
He looks passed out to me.

380
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,541
[RITSU yelps]

381
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,125
Oh, by the way.

382
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,083
Did you give up on your search
to find telepaths, President?

383
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,458
Actually, I haven't
even started yet.

384
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,958
Right now, it's like
a wild-goose chase,

385
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,583
so I'm trying to get
some solid leads first.

386
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,375
It would be nice if you guys
tried to help me out with that.

387
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,416
Well, I did a search on
the internet earlier today,

388
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,875
but I didn't find anything.

389
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,750
You lazy ass! It's not
gonna be that easy!

390
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,708
[MUSASHI]
What's up?

391
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,166
[GUYS]
Musashi!

392
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,333
Seriously, what the heck, Mob?
Did you pass out again?

393
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,916
[TOME]
Inukawa, get some water!

394
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,583
[INUGAWA]
Right. Sure.

395
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,500
[GO]
So what's goin' on?

396
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,916
Why did you insist on
bringing us here again?

397
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,916
I guess you haven't given up
on psychic powers, huh?

398
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,291
Well, I wasn't the one
who requested you.

399
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,208
Actually, it was
for someone else.

400
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,375
[TERU]
Hey, nice to meet you.

401
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,083
So you guys must be the
research subjects here.

402
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,833
[REI]
Whoa. It's another hot guy.

403
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:47,833
I see.

404
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,333
Your powers are
still kinda weak,

405
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,208
but they're totally
worth nurturing.

406
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,208
Let me introduce
Hanazawa, everyone.

407
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,708
He helped fight the
organization that day.

408
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,250
What do you say?

409
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,583
Do you guys want to train with
me to help you get stronger?

410
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,916
[REI]
Huh?

411
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,125
[TERU] Since one of their
divisions was crushed,

412
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,500
I'm sure Claw will make
a move again soon.

413
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,208
It'll be for self-defense,
so you can fight back

414
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,333
when that happens.

415
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,916
[MITSUURA]
And I'll be here as support.

416
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,250
[TAKESHI sighs]

417
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,333
We should. Kageyama took
all the glory that night.

418
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,791
We barely even helped.

419
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,041
You're right.

420
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,875
Come on guys, let's do this!

421
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,208
[OTHERS]
Yeah!

422
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,625
[ARATAKA] Oh, hey.
So what brings you here?

423
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,041
I'm only here because
Shigeo asked me to come.

424
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,375
He passed out and can't help
with exorcising spirits.

425
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,625
Now that I think about it,
do you even need Shigeo anymore?

426
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,083
You awakened your
psychic powers, right?

427
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,166
Don't be stupid. Everything
you saw was Mob's powers.

428
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,916
The only thing I gained from it
is the ability to see you now.

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,750
Otherwise, nothin's
changed at all.

430
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,875
Back to a plain
ol' con artist, huh?

431
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,041
[ARATAKA] You're a rather
rude spirit, aren't you?

432
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,458
Okay. Then come along
and help me out.

433
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,125
The name was Dimple, wasn't it?

434
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,250
Huh? You're kidding me.
Why do I have to help you?

435
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,625
Isn't that the reason he had
you come over to begin with?

436
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,041
If he just wanted to say hi,

437
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,583
he could've simply
called me up.

438
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,625
[DIMPLE]
What? You can't be serious!

439
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,250
Who do you guys think I am?

440
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,625
[ARATAKA]
Well, unless I'm mistaken,

441
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,916
you're Mob's errand boy.

442
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,583
[DIMPLE]
I'm a high-level evil spirit!

443
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,625
[SHO] I'm disappointed in you.
You coward.

444
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,250
[MOB] Did I do something
he thought was lame?

445
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,541
Did I make some kind of mistake?

446
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,916
Really, Shigeo? Again?

447
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,500
I thought I told you to fix
that habit of yours.

448
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,500
Come on, dear,
he's just at that age.

449
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,208
Let him bend all the spoons
he wants. What's the big deal?

450
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,500
[MOB'S MOM] You always
say that, you pushover.

451
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,375
[RITSU]
Here. Let me see it.

452
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,500
What is with these kids?

453
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,583
There. Good as new.

454
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,958
Thanks, Ritsu. Appreciate it.

455
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:52,583
[MOB] Eh, who cares what
some guy thinks anyway?

456
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,416
[phone ringing]

457
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,083
[SHO]
Oh! I've been looking for you.

458
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,250
[SHO]
Hello? Yeah, I dropped my phone.

459
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,541
The 7th Division?
They were annihilated.

460
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,916
Espers infiltrated the place and
slaughtered the upper echelon.

461
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,166
The division leader, Ishiguro,
went down like a house of cards.

462
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,458
Ha. Oh, and as for
all of the underlings?

463
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,583
The enemy totally appealed
to their emotions

464
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,666
and won them over.

465
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,833
[SHO laughs]

466
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,291
Sho, what're you talking about?

467
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,583
I was asking you for a status
report on the inspection.

468
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,458
The organization
you're so proud of

469
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,958
isn't the best in the
world by a long shot.

470
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,375
Quit messin' around and come
back to Japan already, dad,

471
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,833
you idiot.

472
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,083
[SHO] Makin' me do an
annoying inspection...

473
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,416
I sure told him.

474
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,375
Yes. I'll return very soon.

475
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,625
[REPORTER A]
And now, the local news.

476
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,833
Throughout Seasoning City,

477
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,375
we've gotten reports
of tsuchinoko sightings.

478
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,541
City Hall, in a bid to
reinvigorate the area,

479
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,958
put a bounty on
the tsuchinoko

480
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,750
and is requesting
help in capturing it.

481
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,625
Hey, Mob, are you
free right now?

482
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,000
Meet me here in 90 minutes
in your exercise clothes.

483
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,541
Yeah, something you
can get dirty in.

484
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,458
[ARATAKA] We're gonna
capture a tsuchinoko.

485
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,541
Huh?

486
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,375
Come on, aren't you excited?

487
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,500
[MOB]
Isn't this private property?

488
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,208
[ARATAKA] It's the kind of
place where those suckers

489
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,666
are known to show up.

490
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,166
[MOB] Have you ever seen
a tsuchinoko, Master?

491
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,083
[ARATAKA]
Nope. It's just a hunch.

492
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,416
That's pretty random.

493
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,125
[ARATAKA] Don't you have
any passion for UMAs?

494
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,791
You know, Bigfoot,
Nessie, and tsuchinoko!

495
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,333
From what I understand,
there's a bounty on its head.

496
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,250
Well, there's that, too.

497
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,791
[MOB]
Master, um...

498
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,250
[ARATAKA]
What is it?

499
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,083
[MOB] I don't think amateurs
without hiking experience

500
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,416
should go this deep
into the mountains.

501
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,625
[ARATAKA]
Listen, Mob.

502
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,166
We might be amateurs
when it comes to hiking,

503
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,666
but you have psychic powers.

504
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,000
So to me, that kinda
evens things out.

505
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,833
Add that to my ingenuity,
and we've got a--

506
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,666
Ah! Check it out! Over there!

507
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,083
Get your net ready, Mob!

508
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,291
I knew this place was the
jackpot when we got here!

509
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,208
Huh? You actually found one?

510
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,416
No, it's a matsutake!
It's huge!

511
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,458
[MOB]
Oh...

512
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:15,666
After all that talk
about passion,

513
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,583
he's already distracted
by the matsutake.

514
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,833
[gasps]

515
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,666
[ARATAKA]
The hell is that?!

516
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,375
Whatever it is, it's starving
and headed right for us!

517
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,625
We're gonna exorcise it, Mob!

518
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,625
Actually, Master, isn't that
the UMA we were looking for?

519
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:35,666
You idiot! Those
things don't exist!

520
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,291
Quick! Quick! Kill it!

521
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,375
Okay.

522
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:48,000
[ARATAKA] Amazing. It shrank
so much after you exorcised it.

523
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,333
[MOB] Actually, that's
'cause it threw up a lot.

524
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:53,291
What the hell was that
thing anyway? So weird.

525
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,458
You already picked that many?

526
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,333
Whatever. Let's go home.

527
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,708
But... the tsuchinoko...

528
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,250
[ARATAKA]
What are you talkin' about?

529
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,958
Those things don't exist.

530
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,458
[ARATAKA] I'm gonna grill
up some matsutake.

531
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:08,458
[ARATAKA]
You'll have some, right?

532
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:09,958
[MOB]
Sure.

533
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,500
[ARATAKA] Guess we should
buy some <i>kabosu</i> , too.

534
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,750
[MOB]
Sounds good.

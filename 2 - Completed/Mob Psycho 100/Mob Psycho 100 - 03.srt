1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,208
Fight!

2
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:13,500
[ALL] Fight on! Fight on!
Fight on! Fight on!

3
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,791
[MOB] Psychic powers don't
make a man appealing.

4
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,875
So, in order to change
this aspect of myself,

5
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,333
I joined the
Body Improvement Club.

6
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,000
[MUSASHI]
Body improvement!

7
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:28,125
[CLUB MEMBERS]
Fight on! Fight on! Fight on!

8
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,916
Move it!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,541
Fight on... Fight... on...

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,791
[MUSASHI]
Hm? This isn't good.

11
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,541
Guess he must be anemic.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,000
Fi... Fight on...

13
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,916
[TOME] There is something
wrong with him.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I mean, who would choose

15
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,416
the Body Improvement
Club over us?

16
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,458
Let it go. What's done is done.

17
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,041
Let's not dwell on it.

18
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,041
Come on.

19
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,291
It's your turn,
President Kurata.

20
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,125
Hey, guys.

21
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,833
[ALL]
Oh! Hey, Musashi!

22
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,166
And, once again,

23
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,458
thank you so much for
letting us use this room!

24
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,291
[MUSASHI] Really, you
don't have to grovel.

25
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,333
Most of our training's
outside, anyway.

26
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,291
We just need this room
to store our equipment.

27
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,083
[TOME]
Uh... What's with him?

28
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,416
[MUSASHI]
Oh, Kageyama passed out.

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,958
Would you mind
looking after him?

30
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,458
We're still exercising.

31
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,250
[panting]

32
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,583
[TOME]
Now, seriously...

33
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,208
Why did you join the
Body Improvement Club?

34
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,333
Because...

35
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,000
I've never been the
most athletic guy,

36
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,833
and I'm a really slow runner.

37
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,875
I've always relied on my
psychic powers for everything.

38
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,291
Huh?

39
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,333
What kind of lame
excuse is that?

40
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,166
Besides, I don't even
know if you really do

41
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,541
have psychic powers. Prove it.

42
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,208
[ALL gasp]

43
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,333
So was that enough?

44
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,583
Do you believe me now?

45
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,083
Whoa, it's heavy!

46
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,125
[INUGAWA]
Seriously?

47
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,375
He could only
bend spoons before!

48
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,458
[TOME]
Oh!

49
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,833
Kageyama! Please!

50
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,583
Help me make my dream come true!

51
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,666
Huh?

52
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,125
Believe it or not...

53
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,416
...my dream is to make contact

54
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,083
and have initial
interplanetary dialogue

55
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,291
with extraterrestrial
life forms!

56
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,875
When first trying
to achieve this goal,

57
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,833
I followed an instructional
guidebook, but it didn't work.

58
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,000
Before I knew it, I was
just lazing around...

59
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,416
But now that you're here
with your psychic abilities,

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,541
I've finally got a shot!

61
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,916
Mob,

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,250
let's research telepathy
together, seek out new life,

63
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,000
and boldly go where
no man has gone before!

64
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,291
Can't. I've gotta
go pump some iron.

65
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,791
What? You're kidding.

66
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,291
I'm burning with passion here.
Why're you so indifferent?

67
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,041
[MOB] Because I've
finally found something

68
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,625
that I wanna do.

69
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,833
What, putting on some muscle?
You have psychic powers here.

70
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,250
So what difference
does bulking up make?

71
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,041
Actually, it might be
more accurate to say...

72
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,208
I want to become more appealing.

73
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,541
So, you mean...

74
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,500
You wanna be popular?

75
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,000
[gasps]

76
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,625
No, not really...

77
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,666
[TOME]
Well, you won't be.

78
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,916
Huh?

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,541
[TOME]
Even if you gain tons of muscle,

80
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,291
that'll never happen.
Not a chance!

81
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,416
What? Then what
should I do about it?

82
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,416
[TOME] Read girls'
minds using telepathy.

83
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,750
You have the power!

84
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,708
Do that, and you'll
be super popular.

85
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,583
[ARATAKA]
What? Telepathy?

86
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,708
I can't really do
anything like that.

87
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,833
Though, I am able to hear
the voices of spirits.

88
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,791
What brought this on?

89
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,083
Oh, I was just wondering...

90
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,750
Is there someone's mind
you wanna read in particular?

91
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,000
[gasps]

92
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,250
Maybe a girl?

93
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,666
Mob, Mob, Mob...

94
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,750
You are so easy to read.

95
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,958
Look.

96
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,583
Every middle school boy
wants to be popular.

97
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,291
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

98
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,708
It's just a fact of life.

99
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,041
Even yours truly has
dreams of popularity.

100
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,250
[MOB] It's not like I have
to be popular or anything...

101
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,708
I just want Tsubomi to like me.

102

[LOL WOMAN 3A] Young man,
may I ask you a question?

103
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,333
Is something troubling you?

104
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,625
You aren't laughing or smiling.

105
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,000
No...

I can sense these things.

107

You're worried about
your studies, right?

00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,833
My grades are just fine.

109
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,625
[LOL WOMAN 3A]
Of course they are.

110
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,166
It's not your studies...

111
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,125
But, it must be hard
dealing with family issues.

112
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,583
[MOB]
Actually, I don't have any.

113
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,250
[LOL WOMAN 3A]
What I meant to say was...

114
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,250
It must be your health.

115
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,166
No...

116
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,625
It's about love.

00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,708
That's amazing!

these troubles, come with me.

I can't. I have to head home.

00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,875
to a brand-new religious order

125
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,125

Yes. It's called LOL.

Now, now, don't be so hasty.

In order to openly accept

00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,958
you must lower your walls
and set your hearts free.

Heh. You must not

With a personality

you won't be able to laugh
with the girl you like.

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,750
When feelings are shared,

401
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,500
typically, they're
physicalized in some way.

A grade schooler called
"Mob" by those around him.

Even though these
tremendous powers

435
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,041
have been bestowed upon him,

436
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,250
subconsciously he's
always avoided

437

displaying these abilities.

438
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,166
As he grew older and
became more aware,

439
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,416
he came to realize
just how dangerous

440
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,250
his powers were.

441
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,500
When people are unable to act
or to do as they please,

442
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:08,583
or to truly express themselves,
their emotions come to a halt.

While attempting to spare
the world around him,

00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,583
Mob's aversion to
using his powers

00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,500
has become a complex.

The emotions locked away
deep inside his heart

447
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,791
expand little by little,
moment by moment.

448
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,375
However, there's a limit
to how much his emotions

449
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:28,333
can take before leaking
out and going wild.

450
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,458
And now, an emotion
is swirling around

451
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,708
inside him like a
torrential hurricane,

452
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,583
going past the limit.

453
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,166

That emotion... is rage.

454
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,416
[DIMPLE] To think you were
such a powerful esper.

had a trick, too...

a hell of a lot easier

00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,083
Ah, I see...

526
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,791
Some kind of typical mind
control scheme, huh?

527
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,166
That's not salvation.

528
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,541
He just wanted all of
them to depend on him.

529
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,291
It's a popular con based
on crowd psychology,

530
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,041
usually aimed at
the weak-willed.

531
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,708
But with powers like
yours, it didn't work.

532
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:32,833
Oh...

533
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:33,791
[ARATAKA]
Which means you accomplished

534
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,583
something pretty special!

535
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:36,958
Today, you were able to save

536
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,500
a group of people that only
you could have saved.

537
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,416
So, you should be
proud of yourself.

538
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:50,333
[MOB'S MOM] Shige, wake up!
You're gonna be late.

539
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,041
[yawns]

540
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,125
[DIMPLE]
Good morning.

541
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,250
Lovely day, isn't it, partner?

542
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,416
[MOB]
Huh?

543
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,541
[ARATAKA] Mob gets dragged
into an idiotic event

544
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,041
run by idiots for idiots.

545
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,791
The one who appears
before him is a violent

546
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:08,875
yet handsome guy.

547
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,125
What are you gonna do, Mob?!

548
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,625
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho 100</i> ,

549
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,500
Episode 4: "Idiots Only Event

550
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,000
Kin."

551
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,916
You're gonna buy the DVD?
That's an excellent decision!

One that is greater than

Ain't you learned nothin' yet?

00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,500
you can't never really escape...

59

I just realized
this the first time

I seen you without
the No. 2 headband!

142

143
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,625
You look kinda funny!

144
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,541
It's weird man!
I knew something was off!

145
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:48,041
I mean--your
forehead's huge bro!

146
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,083
I thought your hair was big!
But damn!

That's a
four-times-four-times-forehead!

That's what they mean when
they say headquarters!

149
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,625
You're a big headliner!
A headmaster a--

150
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,375
Shut up.

151
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,541
Oh, oh, oh... Now I remember.

152
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,000
The strong,
silent and sensitive type.

153
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,916
Hey-- where we goin?

154
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,458
Is it true?
He's heading this way?!

155
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,333
Oh yeah. It's him!

156
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,541
Can't forget those eyes.
That hair!

157
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:41,333
The cursed creature who
cut down JUSTICE at Mt. Shumi...

158
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,958
...the demon who slaughtered
those we loved...

159
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,000
We can't let this
opportunity pass us by.

160
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,958
Revenge will be ours!

161
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,416
I don't think we
can take him down.

162
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,083
He's too strong!

163
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,291
We... we're not ready yet!

164
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,833
There ain't enough of us!

165
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,291
Come on! They say he hasn't
held his blade in years!

166
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,916
It's true! He's weak!

167
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,166
Now is the only chance.
We strike now!

168
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,916
Hey, how come you
guys know so much?

169
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,625
That lady over there,
she knows all about him.

170
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,583
None of you know nothin!!

171
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,583
What good is
killing him gonna do!?

172
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,041
Everything's already
gone to shit anyway!

173
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,541
You're wrong.

174
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,416
It was after Afro Samurai
killed Justice that the world

175
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,166
descended into chaos.

176
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,666
Men had always killed
for the headbands,

177
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,666
but after Justice died and
Afro refused to replace him,

178
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,666
men began to kill
for the joy of killing...

179
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,083
That is when my husband fell...

180
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,041
Yo! He's coming!

181
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:45,375
Yo! AFRO SAMURAI is coming!

182
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,416
Heh...

183
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,958
As Lady SIO had anticipated...

184
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:03,000
Things are moving,
just as she planned.

185
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,625
Yo AFRO, you might need this.

186
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,333
Y...Y... You murdered my father!

187
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,125
You murdered him!

188
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,041
You killed my only brother!

189
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,375
...and my best friend!

190
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,416
This is for my dead son!

191
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:04,166
A curse on you, demon!
You will burn in hell!

192
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,875
You will drown in the blood of
those innocents you have slain!

193
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,041
You will suffer
the endless bullets

194
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:14,333
and blades of all of us--
Even after death!

195
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:18,833
Curse on you, AFRO SAMURAI!

196
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,208
Ow! Snap! Now this
here is more like it!

197
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,250
Yo man, let me hold some gold!

198
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:27,083
The Afro Samurai is here.

199
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,375
[over the intercom]
Send him in, won't you?

200
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,083
OK now. Here's the plan.

201
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,625
You... ummm... do somethin.

202
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,250
And uh...
I'm gonna get a lap dance

203
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,500
and meet you in
five minutes! Wowww!

204
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,166
Hold up, noo, make that ten!

205
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,333
Oideyasu.

206
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:15,375
The Number Two Headband.

207
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,750
I am afraid
I cannot give you the

208
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:22,166
location of the No. 2
headband for free.

209
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,500
But, If you can defeat me...

210
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,250
Oh no, no.

211
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:33,125
Not by sword. We play these.

212
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:37,916
If you win, I'll tell you
where to find the No. 2.

213
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,791
If I win, I have your head.

214
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,708
Do we have a deal? 

215
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,958
Escort Mr. Afro
to the gamblin' area.

216
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,833
Unlike you, BROTHER ONE,

217
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:04,208
I only play games
that I know I will win.

218
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,083
Heh, heh, heh, heh....

219
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:11,750
Now THAT was off da chizaiiiin!

220
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:15,541
Yo Afro I got a
two-for-one dance, man!

221
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,958
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hey what'd I miss?

222
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,916
Oh we gamblin now? Cool!

223
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:28,125
Let us start the game!

224
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,208
Bet on black! Oops!

225
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:33,291
Wrong game, heh heh heh heh!

226
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,375
Call!

227
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,375
Odd.

228
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,833
Even...

229
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:50,125
Double ones! Even!

230
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,958
AFRO SAMURAI, now that you've

231
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:59,041
lost fair and square,
I must ask you to fulfill your--

232
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,458
Fair?

233
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,958
That cheatin' son-of-a-bitch!

234
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,791
I want a free lap
dance behind dat!

235
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:19,541
The Number Two Headband.

236
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:23,250
The No. 2 is a ronin
named SHICHIGORO.

237
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:27,916
He is in a village called
Machi-City to the west...

238
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,375
Man... Couldn't
we have stayed

239
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,916
a few more minutes
at that gamblin' house?

240
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,333
This shit is boring, man--

241
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,041
You boring!

242
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:57,750
The very demon of revenge
seeks divine guidance? Hah!

243
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,333
Do you really think
you can absolve

244
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:05,166
yourself from sin by
sculpting stupid little toys?

245
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,750
Whoa! Now that's some shit
you don't see every day.

246
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:12,125
You've fallen so far...

247
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:16,083
Coward. I've been watching you.

248
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:20,125
Can you even raise your
sword against another?

249
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:24,500
Where is the cold blooded
killer you once were?

250
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,875
Do you no longer have
the stomach to fight?

251
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:32,875
Will you remain a coward,
even as your father suffers...?

252
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,166
Aw now that just ain't nice.

253
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,500
You don't have
to listen to that shit.

254
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:41,291
And you have such
a long long way to go...

255
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:45,041
to save your
poor tortured father.

256
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,458
I've almost revived
his rotten bones.

257
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,875
Oh, he WILL live again...

258
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:54,083
...to feel PAIN, to SUFFER.

259
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:58,208
And you don't even have
the No. 2 headband yet.

260
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:00,000
So I have a few more days,

261
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,333
or maybe even weeks,

262
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:05,083
to enjoy your father's
pain before you

263
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:09,333
even have the right
to challenge me...

264
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,541
Watch... your damn... mouth.

265
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,708
Cause I'm comin' for my dad.

266
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:53,375
Then we comin' to get you bitch!

267
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:59,500
Finally you are
awake my hated love.

268
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:03,250
Now the fun begins...

269
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:07,541
Whoa. She don't know
who she's fuckin' with.

270
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,500
JINNO...

271
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,791
At last, he has begun to move...

272
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:26,166
All is proceeding as planned.

273
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,958
We will have our revenge.

274
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,208
But, to succeed,
you and I, my love,

275
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:35,500
must walk the path of demons.

276
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:40,625
I am truly sorry but it is the
only way to make him feel the

277
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:45,083
eternal sadness
that we have felt,

278
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:50,541
to make him suffer
as we have suffered.

279
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,041
So please...

280
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:55,250
...forgive me.

281
00:28:55,333 --> 00:29:02,458
Just remember that there
was no alternative.

282
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,750
I will always love you...

283
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,458
My beloved brother.

284
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,666
Your luck sucks, man.

285
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,583
Everybody knows this is the

286
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:37,166
first day of the yearly
parade around here.

287
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,500
You ain't gonna get no info

288
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:42,083
from these party people
about that No. 2 headband.

289
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,708
His name was SHICHIGORO right?

290
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:47,083
You even got any idea
what he look like? I don't!

291
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:50,500
How we even know that's
his real damn name?!?

292
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:04,083
The point I am trying to make
is that this is all a bad idea!

293
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:15,500
Help! Help! Help!

294
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,958
What the?

295
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,750
Out of my way!

296
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,875
A kidnappin' in broad daylight?

297
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,000
That's a damn shame.

298
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,250
Ah, shit... AFRO SAMURAI?

299
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,291
--Out of my way!
--Whoa! Damn!

300
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,166
I said move,
you son of a bitch!!!

301
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,541
Gun! Afro! Gun! Heater!
Rosco! Gat! Duck!

302
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,375
Gahhh!!!!

303
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,875
Waa! Waa!

304
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:08,875
KOTARO!

305
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,791
[crying] Oh Daddy!!

306
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:28,000
KOTARO.
I told you to stay close.

307
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,541
I'm sorry...

308
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,708
You. You have my thanks.

309
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,375
This coward
kidnapped my boy to...

310
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,708
Forget it.

311
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,458
Let me buy you a drink...

312
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:50,500
...I know a spot nearby.

313
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,875
Uh-oh. I think I lost
a Ninja boot! Wait!

314
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:04,208
I'm drowning! Hey! AFRO!

315
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,250
Don't leave a brotha!

316
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,875
I'm home old man!

317
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:27,708
Hey hey! You brought
a friend today?

318
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:31,125
This man saved KOTARO'S life.

319
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,541
So maybe he's strong enough

320
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:35,208
not to die from
your stew ole man.

321
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,916
Watch your mouth when
you talk about my oden

322
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,416
SHICHIGORO, or you might
find a hot pepper in your bowl.

323
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,875
You call this crap oden? Ha!

324
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,333
More like chunky rat poison!

325
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:50,166
Anyway, give me and the kid two

326
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,625
of the usual and throw in
a couple cups of sake. Hot.

327
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:56,375
Coming right up!

328
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:58,541
Chunky rat poison!

329
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:03,708
Just for you,
you little street rat!

330
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,208
You're the street rat!

331
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:20,166
Hey I'm back! Found my shoe too!

332
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,583
Oh, ya getting' your
grub on? Oh, ewwww...

333
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,250
Somethin' smells funky!

334
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,416
Oh shit! That's the dude!?!

335
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:32,333
Whaddya have, partner?

336
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,375
Sukiyaki.

337
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,041
Double that!

338
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,208
Here's to you.

339
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,583
Oh, not a drinker, eh?

340
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,250
Don't know what you're missin'!

341
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,916
Lemonade, then?

342
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:13,583
Kidding. Kidding.

343
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:16,666
Forget it. I'll drink both.

344
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:25,250
You aren't here for
the festival, are you...?

345
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,125
Me neither.
Just passing through.

346
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:33,375
But, I guess
we overstayed a bit.

347
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,916
We had our chuckles
at the festival.

348
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,625
But, it's best we move on.

349
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,750
Ya know, it sucks
that you gotta kill this dude.

350
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:52,333
I gotta say, he ain't
so bad! Kinda cool...

351
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,166
It's always lonely
after the festival.

352
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,750
At least this
is the last time I'll

353
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:16,166
have to eat
your lousy rat poison!

354
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,666
You'll be sorry.
I make the best stew

355
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,458
for miles around.
When you come back--

356
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:25,291
remind me to charge you double.

357
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:29,791
Jeeeeesus! This is the best?

358
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:33,333
Afro, maybe you oughta kill
this motha fucka too for lying.

359
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,250
This stew sucks! 

360
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:41,791
Lemonade. Please. Help yourself.

361
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,750
That guy earlier...

362
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,791
That man you cut down.

363
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:57,416
You want to know why
he tried to kidnap KOTARO?

364
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,416
Hell, no.

365
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,708
Do you want to know why anyone

366
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:02,541
bothers with a street kid
and a drunk like me?

367
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,291
Hell, no.

368
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,708
SHICHIGORO...

369
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,750
It's OK, ole man.

370
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,416
Okay, tell us.

371
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,083
I got something
everybody wants...

372
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,166
One minute he's
stuffing his face,

373
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,208
the next he's passed out.

374
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:50,166
He ain't even mine.
He's an orphan--

375
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,541
the son of a pal who
got himself murdered.

376
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:58,083
I promised to watch him if he
ever got in trouble or killed.

377
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:01,916
Me and that old bastard
were like brothers.

378
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,041
He wasn't the brightest,
but he was a good man.

379
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:09,416
He died when this kid was a pup.

380
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,291
I heard the man who killed
him had a weird look.

381
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,083
An Afro hairdo with
a greenish tint

382
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,833
if you look real close.

383
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:24,000
Now you listen to
me and you listen good.

384
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,541
In this world,

385
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,291
there are bonds
deeper than blood...

386
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,375
Huh? Wha?

387
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,458
My pal, that dumb
son-of-a-bitch,

388
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,208
he was like so
many fools who went

389
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,166
after those headbands of legend.

390
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,541
All he wound up
was dead.

391
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:45,291
Know what he said to me
when I found him dying?

392
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:52,250
"No more," he whispered.

393
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:57,458
So, I got that No. 2 headband
myself and I hid it.

394
00:38:57,541 --> 00:39:00,458
Been on the run ever since.

395
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,083
But now you've come...

396
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,875
...and now we're even. 

397
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:35,125
So, let's get this over with.

398
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,750
Oh damn! It's ON now!

399
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:44,375
No more Mr. Nice Afro!

400
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,041
SHICHIGORO...!

401
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:50,083
Keep that
poison hot, ole man.

402
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,125
I'll be back in a flash.

403
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,666
Hm...

404
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,041
I thought if KOTARO
and me just kept movin...

405
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,375
...maybe folks
would forget about

406
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:34,916
it all and I could
honor my pal's

407
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,041
wish of peace for his son.

408
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,541
But I guess there ain't
no hidin' from fate. Dammit.

409
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:49,666
All these damn headbands do is
make dead buddies and orphans.

410
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,833
You hear me AFRO?

411
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,416
Dead bodies and orphans!

412
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,083
So, I ain't givin you
the No. 2 headband.

413
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,291
You'll have to
kill me to get it.

414
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:04,666
Not because I'm playin' by

415
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,333
the headband rules,
and not because

416
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:09,291
I'm out to save
the world neither!

417
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:16,750
Yo AFRO! What's-up
with the formal stance?

418
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,583
He cool and all,
but he ain't your pal!

419
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,500
Just dent this fool!

420
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,208
It's because I keep my promises.

421
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,000
Don't think I don't know
you AFRO SAMURAI.

422
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:47,166
I saw what you
did on the boardwalk.

423
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,791
Killing a man without
a moment of hesitation--

424
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:55,458
like he was nothin'
but a fly on your face.

425
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:59,708
Maybe it's time
someone swatted you.

426
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:02,916
Maybe I feel like
I'm the guy to do it.

427
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,875
You gonna let
him talk all that trash?

428
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:07,458
Slice him and dice him, Afro!

429
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:17,583
Sayonara, AFRO SAMURAI.

430
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:19,125
Now that's just wack.

431
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,041
You gonna die, creep!

432
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,500
[painful grunt]
Guh!!!

433
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,833
Shit! This guy's slick!

434
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:15,041
I'm impressed! He just
might kill your ass!

435
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,458
Aww man, you runnin?

436
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:47,000
You makin' us look bad dude!

437
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,875
Where you going?

438
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,250
Ahhh, I knew you
was bein' devious!

439
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,041
We ain't never run
from nobody,

440
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:07,875
and we ain't about to
pick today to start running!

441
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,750
Hey man! Keep on swingin'!

442
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,666
Whilst I get my groove on!

443
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,958
Let's paaaarrrttaaayyyy!

444
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,791
Awwwwww shit!
Now we partyin' like rockstars!

445
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:41,416
Light show! Light show!

446
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,750
Mmm hmm... mmm hmm!

447
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,083
Bring it baby.

448
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:15,250
Yeah, boom boom.

449
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:46,833
Yeah yeah, whuddup yo!

450
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:48,750
We're gonna get this party
crackin' right now!

451
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,166
Now on center stage:

452
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,375
we got the man with
the No. 2 headband!

453
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:53,916
Don't stop, get it, get it!

454
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,583
Buzza buzza boom! Buzza boom!

455
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:24,833
Hey! Where'd they come from?

456
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,750
Urgh! This is only half-cooked.

457
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,125
You expect me to eat this?

458
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:36,791
I broke my teeth on this crap.

459
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:37,958
This is disgusting.

460
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:39,583
How do you even
stay in business?

461
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,041
Come on, let's get out of here.

462
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,000
This place should be shut down.

463
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,625
Dad...?

464
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,333
KOTARO?

465
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:19,750
Aww man!
You've killed the music!

466
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:23,208
Why you always got to
wreck the party!?!

467
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,500
Well, that was an
unnecessary distraction.

468
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,625
Still want to die?

469
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,208
You want it that much?

470
00:48:42,291 --> 00:48:45,083
It's just a piece
of cloth you idiot.

471
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:55,083
If you're feeling so lucky--
come and get it.

472
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:25,833
What the fu...

473
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:27,500
Shut up.

474
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:28,375
Sumanai.
["sorry" in samurai dialect]

475
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:15,000
Man, you always got to
bust up the fun, don't you?

476
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:17,833
I was ravin' til the
break a dawn, man!

477
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,916
Light sticks and everything!

478
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,708
Why'd you go and ruin it?

479
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:23,375
I bet they even
cancel the damn thing

480
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:25,750
next year and
its all your fault.

481
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:29,000
And another thing...
you ain't all that,

482
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:33,083
just cause you back
to being the No. 2 again!

483
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:34,458
Don't you get it?

484
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:37,291
We walkin' the demon path again!

485
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:39,333
It ain't the right way!

486
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:46,958
Ah well. Whatever.
So where we goin' next?

487
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,541
How about getting
a little 'push push' first?

488
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,125
Know what I'm sayin'?!?!

489
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,000
Man we never party!

490
00:51:57,416 --> 00:52:00,250
Damn, now what's
fin to jump off?

491
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,250
Whoa wait. Didn't they
already kick your ass?

492
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,708
They coming after you again?

493
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:16,583
Your blade stains
the world with blood.

494
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,500
Oh, you think!?

495
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:21,958
You kill only for your
selfish petty reasons...

496
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,125
Have you no heart?

497
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:44,416
Uh... Urgh... Uh...

498
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:50,916
This can't be real man.

499
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,708
Who the hell are these people!

500
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,583
This ain't possible!

501
00:52:56,958 --> 00:52:58,916
Grrrrrgggrgargagrgargggghhhh!!!

502
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,458
I don't think so.

503
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:15,333
You should restrain yourself or

504
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:19,333
risk another
humiliating beating.

505
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:23,833
You don't want to risk
breaking my new toy do you?

506
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:27,416
He's ever so fragile right now.

507
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,458
Go to the Cherry Hill--
or he dies again.

508
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:36,750
But this time...
much much much more slowly.

509
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:43,333
Watch... your damn... mouth!

510
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:46,583
BIN!

511
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,625
My lady!

512
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:50,291
Step back.

513
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:11,958
Um. Damn. You alright, man?

514
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,791
NO!

515
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:35,708
JINNO!

516
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:45,666
Hey easy little sis!

517
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,125
It's been a long time,
hasn't it, SIO?

518
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:50,708
How've you been, princess?

519
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:51,958
Good!

520
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:54,333
And our foster parents?
How are they?

521
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,291
They've been great!

522
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:57,916
They're like real parents.

523
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,708
And, they got this
guy named BIN-SAN.

524
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:01,541
He's kinda strict and scary.

525
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:03,333
And this other guy MICHAEL-SAN--

526
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:04,916
He plays with me lots.

527
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,916
Oh, oh, then this
lady TOMOE-SAN,

528
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,875
teaches me to be
like a real princess!

529
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:14,416
I even learned to dance and
have tea and everything!

530
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:18,041
Wow. That's great.

531
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:21,500
I wish you could
be here with me.

532
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:24,916
I know, little sister.
But you're safe here.

533
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,208
This family wanted a daughter

534
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:28,583
of their own to
replace the one they lost.

535
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:31,708
Now I see they've
accepted you as their own.

536
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:33,666
We should both be grateful.

537
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,000
I'll try to visit more, OK?

538
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:40,666
Hey, there's someone
I want you to meet.

539
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:44,166
This is AFRO. AFRO--this
is SIO--my sister.

540
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,083
Oh! Hi AFRO.

541
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:49,000
Um. Hi.

542
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:52,458
He's a newcomer at the sword
school. But he's real good--

543
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:54,291
almost as good as me!

544
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:55,750
He's like a brother.

545
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,000
Brother?

546
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:00,250
Uh-huh.

547
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:04,791
So I guess that makes
you my brother too?

548
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:07,166
Umm.. Yeah I guess.

549
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:11,375
Cool!

550
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:13,416
I just got another brother!

551
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,583
Yup. 

552
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:18,375
Can I see the sword
school someday too?

553
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,250
Yeah. Sure. Anytime.

554
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:25,916
You're shy.
And you're hair is funny!

555
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,458
Um... nice to meet you too...

556
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:57,541
You will soon be free...

557
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:01,458
You can't just toy with
science like that lady Sio!

558
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:03,291
Are you mad!?!

559
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:08,291
Once he's complete he could very
well be the ULTIMATE SAMURAI!

560
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:10,166
But, if his growth
is interrupted--

561
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:15,875
he could end-up just a
pile of worthless protein jelly!

562
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:19,333
Mad? That's a
strange word coming

563
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:22,333
from the very image of madness.

564
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:26,125
But, our plans could
have been ruined!

565
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:30,250
Ah, it's part of the
process dear professor.

566
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:34,125
The more I taunt
AFRO, the better.

567
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:39,250
I want his suffering
to be long and slow.

568
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:41,458
His death is not my goal--

569
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,625
only the final
exclamation point.

570
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:47,750
Don't you know me by now?

571
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:52,000
[stuttering]
Of course, Lady Sio.

572
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:54,416
You are truly twisted.

573
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:59,000
But, it's j-just...
The risks...

574
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:05,541
[laughter]
What a refreshing experience!

575
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:08,000
I've twisted the most twisted

576
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:13,125
scientist in the world
with MY twistedness!

577
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:17,666
Don't fear,
my round friend.

578
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:22,625
Everything is
moving so deliciously.

579
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:25,208
Have a little faith!

580
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,916
Yes, my Lady.

581
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:33,583
With my guidance,
it won't end as badly

582
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:37,666
as your failed masterpiece KUMA.

583
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,166
Look at him.

584
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,500
You've repaired him so many

585
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:44,000
times that there's
no human left at all.

586
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:47,833
He's just a mindless
samurai doll.

587
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:51,833
Soulless. Dead.

588
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:53,416
It disgusts you doesn't it?

589
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,250
The failure--I mean--
the frustratingly

590
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,500
crude limits of the human body.

591
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:03,958
But even your full mechanical
works have been destroyed.

592
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,958
The AFRO DROID--

593
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:09,125
Ha! Scrap metal at the bottom

594
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:13,333
of the ruined temple
of the Empty Seven.

595
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,208
But now...

596
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:19,916
Muscle, bone,
blood, bile, merged

597
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,125
with nano-technology, chemically
programmed neuro-receptors,

598
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:27,041
and things so forbidden

599
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:30,666
it's more Alchemy,
than bio-technology.

600
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:37,791
You truly are the
world's most wicked,

601
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:41,291
shit-faced genius scientist.

602
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:46,041
You'll burn in hell for your
insults against nature.

603
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:50,208
You praise me so
wonderfully Lady Sio.

604
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:53,375
I am not worthy
of your poetry...

605
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:59,166
You scum. History will mourn the
atrocities you now commit.

606
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,291
You should be burned alive.

607
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,416
Ahhhh...!

608
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:20,166
AFRO will chase me--
and my brother--

609
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,083
to the ruined city.

610
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:28,083
When he arrives, he will see
the consequences of his sins.

611
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:31,916
His twice-killed only friend...

612
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,125
...and his beloved
father shall impale

613
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:38,250
him with their vengeful blades.

614
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:42,000
And then--at the last moment,

615
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:44,166
these hands will be the ones

616
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:48,833
that end the life of
AFRO SAMURAI.

617
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:57,208
He's not even worthy to die
by your erotic and wicked hands!

618
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:08,041
But his end will not bring
him bliss, my professor.

619
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:23,416
Damn it's hot up in this piece!

620
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,583
Ain't there a quicker
way to Cherry Hill?

621
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:27,125
And by the way, you KNOW

622
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:30,250
that bitch SIO is walkin'
us into a trap don't ya?

623
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:33,833
That was one weird
family reunion too--

624
01:01:33,916 --> 01:01:36,875
eh Afro? I'm sure
lots of folks would

625
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:38,875
love to see their dead
daddies alive again.

626
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:42,666
But, I'm not so sure seeing a
living head with nasty ass guts

627
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,416
and shit is what most
folks had in mind!

628
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,375
I mean, how could
he be alive, huh?

629
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:49,041
Maybe it wasn't him!

630
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,333
It's a trick!

631
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:52,916
Maybe it was another
robot like that AFRO DROID

632
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,666
you killed a while back.

633
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,291
Or, maybe it was like a muppet!

634
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:59,625
You know, like controlled
by her hand or something.

635
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:04,958
OK that was stupid.
It ain't no muppet.

636
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:06,416
But whatever it was--

637
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,541
one thing is for sure.

638
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:13,166
That bitch is... crazy!

639
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,375
She must really hate you to
do all of this unnatural shit.

640
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:18,041
And what's up with KUMA?

641
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,458
Ain't he normally the cryin'
and complainin' type?

642
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,666
Dude didn't say a damn word!

643
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,958
Now THAT creeps me out.

644
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,541
Sumpin' is wrong
and I don't like it!

645
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:29,458
Oh... And... Uh...

646
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:32,666
Whaddya wanna do
'bout that kid followin' us?

647
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,916
So... What like
you like killed his

648
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,250
paps and now he's
probably trying to axe you.

649
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:41,541
That sounds familiar
don't it? Heee hee!

650
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:45,083
Well don't sweat iut.

651
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,791
Kid ain't gonna
last much longer.

652
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,166
Little bit's been
draggin' behind

653
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:51,708
us in this damn heat for days.

654
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:53,958
He'll be dead by morning.

655
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,708
I'm sorry Daddy...

656
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:31,166
I wish you three could have
seen the look on his face when

657
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:35,666
I showed him the living head
of his own dead father.

658
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:39,041
Never forget that
it was AFRO SAMURAI

659
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,666
that made you what you are.

660
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:45,541
He will live in Hell on Earth
for what he has done to us.

661
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:48,916
You will enjoy every second of

662
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,125
excrutiating agony
that I inflict upon him.

663
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:56,750
You will watch as he bleeds
from his very pores,

664
01:04:56,833 --> 01:05:02,041
listen to the sound
of his breaking bones,

665
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:07,291
smell his fear
and his burning flesh.

666
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:30,583
His death will be so filled

667
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:35,125
with horror,
it will pass into legend.

668
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:36,750
And I will too--

669
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:40,500
as his legendary executioner!

670
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:36,416
Mountain Climbing?

671
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,625
How'd I get talked
into this, man?

672
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:43,750
We got no equipment!
I need a sports drink!

673
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,708
You got a rope?

674
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:48,250
You sure we goin' the right way?

675
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,291
The air's getting' thin Afro!

676
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:56,041
I think I'm gonna die, man!

677
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:57,833
Or at least have a stroke.

678
01:06:57,916 --> 01:07:01,000
You stressin' me out!
I hate heights!

679
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:20,708
[whistles]

680
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:24,500
Is this the meeting spot? Damn!

681
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:28,541
I bet back in the day
this place was SWEET!

682
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:31,041
It's like a messed-up
theme park!

683
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:34,250
Bet they had Candy Corn,
Funnel Cakes...

684
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:37,500
...some mean ass
coasters, the works!

685
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:39,791
Ain't nobody home now, though..

686
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:41,958
But what happened to it, man?

687
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:46,583
Shame it's all in ruins.
Who did this?

688
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:49,750
Hey, AFRO, are you sure this is

689
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:53,375
the place that the chick said
she'd be waiting for you?

690
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:56,666
Check it out, that's JUSTICE!

691
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:57,666
You know you never did

692
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,916
ask for directions
along the way.

693
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,500
Yo AFRO!

694
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,208
Umm. Now whose these is?

695
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:47,916
Costume party?
Welcome committee?

696
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Comedy troupe?

697
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:51,875
Yeah, thanks. But umm...
no thanks...

698
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:55,041
...we gotta go to a meeting, OK?

699
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:02,000
Okay! Let's see. Yo FUNNY FACE!

700
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:05,375
You seen a crazy
sexy bitch with

701
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:08,166
a teddy bear headed
dude around here?

702
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:11,666
That ain't no blunt!

703
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:15,625
Aw...! What the...?

704
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:19,041
Ohhhhhh AFRO!

705
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:21,166
Am I gonna die again?

706
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:29,625
Lady SIO is... not here.

707
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:35,083
You don't remember us, do you?

708
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:38,208
AFRO SAMURAI...

709
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:41,833
Who would have imagined
that the boy we once knew...

710
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:45,625
...would return as
such a mad executioner...

711
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:48,541
Driven only by
his murderous rage...

712
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:52,416
...to bring death
and chaos to the world...

713
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,583
Draw your sword, AFRO SAMURAI.

714
01:11:00,416 --> 01:11:02,208
Now you die!

715
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:21,083
Professor...

716
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:25,583
What ails you, my lady?
Please rejoice.

717
01:11:25,666 --> 01:11:30,500
The restoration of AFRO'S father
has entered the final stage.

718
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:33,833
However, this stage
is very sensitive.

719
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:39,458
If the slightest error occurs,
we still could lose everything.

720
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:42,875
They are gone.

721
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:44,541
What's this?

722
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:48,666
They would never undertake
anything without my orders.

723
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:49,958
What have you done?

724
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:53,791
Perhaps they went into town?

725
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,208
What do you mean?

726
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:58,625
Or perhaps...

727
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:02,416
They challenged AFRO
SAMURAI without you...

728
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:08,791
But don't fear. Who knows--
they might just win.

729
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:11,500
After all, you might
be surprised to

730
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:13,625
hear that they all have quite an

731
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:16,916
impressive array of
gadgets engineered

732
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,750
on their bodies not to mention
a special drug injection or two.

733
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:35,166
L...Lady SIO?
What sport is this?

734
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:45,583
My, my, my.

735
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:49,833
What a hasty princess
we have here.

736
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:52,583
The regeneration is not yet...

737
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:59,458
Heh heh heh. You've done such a
splendid job, dear Professor.

738
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,625
You've equipped
all of the players

739
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:04,166
with all the right
modifications.

740
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:06,833
I owe you my thanks.

741
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,958
Now it's time for you to
take a well-deserved break.

742
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:16,958
Good night Professor!

743
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:36,250
The other "executioner"
is about to awaken...

744
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:59,250
No matter your intentions...

745
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:02,708
There are things that we
cannot allow you to do...

746
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:07,333
We must not allow our Lady SIO
to tread the path of darkness...

747
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:10,916
Such a sweet lady she is...

748
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,500
...we will not allow her
to fall from grace.

749
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:19,625
Instead, we will be the sinners.

750
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:57,416
All I wanted was for AFRO to
see the town he destroyed.

751
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,750
I wanted him to see the

752
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:02,375
consequences of his sin
before I slit his throat.

753
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:05,041
But now my vassals
are most likely dead.

754
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:11,291
Fools rush in where
angels fear to tread.

755
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:58,791
MICHAEL! SHOOT HIM NOW!

756
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:05,500
What are you waiting for? Do it!

757
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,333
Shoot them...

758
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,958
She's dead already...

759
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:13,625
Do it... for our Lady SIO...

760
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:41,166
TOMOE!

761
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:22,541
AFRO SAMURAI...

762
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:31,291
I knew that sooner or later
this day would come.

763
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:36,875
I will die with you.

764
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:31,416
What the hell?

765
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:38,666
Yo AFRO! AFRO!!!!

766
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:49,625
AFRO! You made it!

767
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:51,250
How'd you survive home boy?

768
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:52,583
Tell me what I missed! Ya know,

769
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:54,666
I got hit by a sleeping
dart. Hurt too!

770
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,000
But I'm a tough, so don't worry.

771
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,500
So did you whack some
crazy moth a fuckas?

772
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:10,291
What the...?!

773
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:24,625
Follow me, son.

774
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:27,958
HOLY FUCK!

775
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:33,375
Now I HAVE
officially seen it all!

776
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:51,833
SIO... JINNO...

777
01:20:51,916 --> 01:20:56,000
Hey AFRO. why you got to
walk directly into every trap?

778
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:58,250
You stupid or what?

779
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:00,375
Up there is the
crazy bitch who been

780
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:01,916
pullin' the strings
this whole time

781
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,083
AND your old revived robo-pal--

782
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:06,416
who don't like your ass neither!

783
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,666
On top of that,
we followin' some

784
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:11,458
freak o nature that
you think is your dad!

785
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:14,666
That is my real father.

786
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:20,000
Ergh! Wrong answer. That's it. 

787
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:26,291
You're an idiot. And this is as
far as I can go. See ya!

788
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:35,500
I'm so happy you've made it.

789
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:38,250
We've have so much to...
talk about!

790
01:21:42,916 --> 01:21:47,583
I have come for my father
and the No. 1 headband.

791
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:49,708
What a surprise...

792
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:51,500
But what can you possibly do

793
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:56,291
with your body
so utterly destroyed?

794
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:13,708
We're going to torture you.

795
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:15,916
Death will come slowly.

796
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:36,916
Why didn't you wear
the No. 1 headband?

797
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,208
I just wanted revenge...
for you.

798
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:44,750
Whatever your reason,
one must shoulder the burden of

799
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:48,333
destiny the instant he
puts on the headband.

800
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:50,750
You should know that by now.

801
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:53,458
Become the No. 1.

802
01:22:53,541 --> 01:22:58,000
You can never escape
the cycle of blood.

803
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:04,875
The No. 1 kills or is killed.

804
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:09,208
You don't have the luxury to
choose whose blood you spill.

805
01:23:09,291 --> 01:23:12,291
Take back your headband.

806
01:23:12,375 --> 01:23:16,583
Fear not... my son...

807
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:20,166
Urgh... father... wait...

808
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,833
Father...

809
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:23,625
Look... Look my dear brother.

810
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:27,541
AFRO SAMURAI is
about to meet his end...

811
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:29,291
Just as I planned--

812
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:32,541
at the hands of his own father!

813
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:38,000
He will finally pay for
the pain he's caused us--

814
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:48,083
for the pain he's caused
thousands... like us!

815
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:58,083
for the pain he's caused
thousands... like us!

816
01:24:58,166 --> 01:25:08,083
for the pain he's caused
thousands... like us!

817
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:18,083
for the pain he's caused
thousands... like us!

818
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:29,083
for the pain he's caused
thousands... like us!

819
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:32,166
JINNO! JINNO!

820
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:57,291
Kill him! Kill him!

821
01:25:57,375 --> 01:26:01,708
Once and for all! [laughter]

822
01:26:40,833 --> 01:26:43,000
[struggling] Ahh....

823
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:45,041
...AFRO....

824
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:52,166
[groan]

825
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,708
Kill him AFRO! Waste him!

826
01:26:54,791 --> 01:26:56,208
That ain't your real father!

827
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:59,875
That's it! Finish it! Do it!

828
01:26:59,958 --> 01:27:03,333
I cannot kill my father...

829
01:27:03,416 --> 01:27:07,291
Wha... then this
is the end of AFRO!

830
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,541
Did you see that, JINNO?

831
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:34,333
We did it! We finally
brought him to justice!

832
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:39,375
And it was we...
we who killed him!!

833
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:42,666
Look, look my dear brother!

834
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:48,333
JINNO? JINNO?

835
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:51,625
[whispering] AFRO...

836
01:27:56,166 --> 01:27:59,125
AF...RO...

837
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:06,916
AFRO!!!!

838
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:20,666
What have you done...

839
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:24,458
What have you done to AFRO?!!

840
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:29,083
Why...?

841
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,916
Jinno! Why are you
protecting AFRO?!

842
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,833
He's dead now! It's no use!

843
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:45,791
Have you forgotten what
AFRO did to us? To you!?!

844
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:08,458
JINNO!

845
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,375
[groan]
AFRO...

846
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:27,083
My... dearest... brother...

847
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,125
I must...

848
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:36,625
...protect SWORDMASTER'S dojo...

849
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:41,541
...must protect everyone...

850
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:47,833
...including my brother... AFRO.

851
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,500
I love you, my JINNO...

852
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,500
My brother...

853
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:25,083
It's been a long time,
hasn't it, SIO?

854
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:34,375
How have you been, princess?

855
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:40,000
JIN...NO...

856
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:45,333
[groan]

857
01:32:56,833 --> 01:32:59,666
Run, AFRO! You can't win.

858
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:03,750
I said RUN, damn it!
You can't win this one.

859
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:07,083
He's too strong! He ain't human!

860
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:10,583
Don't! Don't!

861
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:13,083
Shut...

862
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:14,541
...up.

863
01:33:14,916 --> 01:33:16,708
It'll soon be over.

864
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,791
Forgive me.
But, you are not my father.

865
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:27,375
My father died a long time ago.

866
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,583
Fear not...

867
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:20,666
Father!

868
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:45,333
[frightened sob]

869
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:06,541
Anytime you're ready.

870
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:25,333
Will it ever end?

871
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:32,791
[sigh] Guess not.

872
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:33,916
From the look on your face,

873
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,250
I'd say you had a
hell of a rough day.

874
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:39,000
You knew this, didn't you?

875
01:35:39,083 --> 01:35:43,333
You knew it don't
ever end once it starts.

876
01:35:43,416 --> 01:35:45,916
I KNEW, AFRO SAMURAI.

877
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,750
But, I won't say nothin'.
Not anymore.

878
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:53,416
But, y'know.
Not turning your back...

879
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:57,791
...that's the only
choice you've EVER had.

880
01:40:42,166 --> 01:40:46,708
Been waiting a
long time for you.

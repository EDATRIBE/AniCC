Miss Kobayashi! Kanna!

Breakfast is ready!

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,666
[KOBAYASHI slurps]
Your miso soup is killer today.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,250
[TOHRU]
Thank you, I'm glad you like it!

5
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,875
I decided to try
something different

6
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,166
and only use ingredients
from this world.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,333
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmph.

8
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,166

We'll see you later.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,750
[TOHRU]
Okay.

10
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,875
Be sure to watch out
for those cars!

11
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,458
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,000
Remember, Kanna, if a car hits
you, you'll smash it to bits.

13
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,125
[KANNA]
I know.

14
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,041
Perfect! Miss Kobayashi didn't
get angry or chastise me

15
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,166
about anything
I did this morning!

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,083
Success, Tohru! Success!

17
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:52,166
[laughs] I feel like my maid
skills are definitely improving!

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,208
Hey, that could mean
I'm finally getting used

19
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,416
to this world. Yay!

[FEMALE WORKER A] I don't know
what's going on with you,

23
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,083
but you've been
a lot happier lately.

24
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,708
What? I have?

25
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,125
Yeah, it's not like
you were sad,

26
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,541
but you were a bit more stoic.
Well, a lot more stoic.

27
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,291
I dunno, you just seem a lot
more open, if that makes sense.

28
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,125
[BOTH laugh]

29
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,291
[FEMALE WORKER A]
See you later!

30
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,208
[KOBAYASHI] It's been, what? Two
months now since she showed up?

31
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,750
[KOBAYASHI]
Two months, and I have no idea

32
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,375
what I was like before then.

33
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,583
[TOHRU yells]

34
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,916
[CHEF A] The secret to this dish
is to marinate it in honey.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
[TOHRU]
I should try that.

36
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,750
Yeah, maybe then, Miss Kobayashi
will give my tail meat a shot.

Totally right, ladies

[REPORTER A]
And now for the evening news.

47
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,333
Early this morning, a fire broke
out in Tatsumicho Nishiku.

48

[TAKIYA]
Kobayashi.

49
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,333
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

50
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,583
Y'know, I hate asking,

51
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,208
but would you mind
helping me out with this?

52
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,416
Sure, whatcha got?

53
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,500
[KOBAYASHI] Whoa.
Looks like I'm not the only one

54
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,208
who takes on too much.

55
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,083
[TOHRU chuckles]
I've been wanting to see

56
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,500
what Miss Kobayashi
is like at work

57
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,875
since I first found out
she had a job!

58

[giggles]

59
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,666
[TOHRU] One of my 48 maid
skills: perception blocking.

60
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,041
Now I can walk around
without anyone noticing.

61
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,750
Ah! There she is!

62
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, looks like I don't
have any other choice.

63
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,708
Yeah, thanks. You, too.

64
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
[KOBAYASHI sighs]

65
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,458
[TAKIYA] Uh-oh, that
didn't look very good.

66
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,416
[TOHRU growls]
Takiya?

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,916
Yeah, no. Remember that project
Yamashita was working on?

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,791
Well, there's a
big problem with it.

69
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,375
And if it's not fixed today,
he'll basically be screwed.

70
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,416
Ah...

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,666
Sorry.

72
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,541
So, as of now,
I've gotta prioritize that.

73
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,166
Meaning I can't help you.

74
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,291
At least, not at until
that's fixed. I'm sorry.

75
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,583
Why're you apologizing?

76
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,375
I totally get it. No worries.

Gimme a minute though.

This schedule sucks.
I mean it's just impossible.

There's gotta be a way
to push it back.

84
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,791
Gotcha. But this still
needs to be reevaluated.

85
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,083
[TOHRU] Humans may gather
together, help each other,

86
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,125
and accomplish a lot of things,

87
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:18,458
but their civilization could
easily be destroyed by dragons.

88
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:22,666
Bottom line, I still think
dragons are way better.

again pushing his work off

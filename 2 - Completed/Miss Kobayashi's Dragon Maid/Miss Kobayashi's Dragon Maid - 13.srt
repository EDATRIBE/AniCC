[KOBAYASHI]
Hm?

4
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,208
I promised Saikawa
that I would

5
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,125
play with her in the park today.

6
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,375
Oh, fun. Have a good time.

7
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,833
Do you have any big plans
for the day, Miss Kobayashi?

8
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,708
[KOBAYASHI] Hmm. I guess I'd
like to spend my day off

00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,125
relaxing at home.

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,750
I knew you'd say that!

11
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,333
So I am prepared
to give my utmost

12
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,500
to ensure said relaxation.

13
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,166
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmmm.

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,125
Cool. Leaving me alone
is enough, though.

I hope the sun comes out today.

So pretty.

[KANNA]
Flower language?

22
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
It's a book about
what flowers mean.

23
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,625
Georgie is letting me borrow it.

24
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,250

Oh, there it is!

29
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,708
Apparently, it means
I'll offer everything to you.

Here you go, Kanna.

Here you go, Miss Kobayashi.

Do you love it?

38
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,333
Yeah, it's really tasty.

39
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,125
I was hoping so!

40
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,541
I've been working on adjusting
the temperature and intensity

feeling at the moment!

Hmmm.

You dragons
are an amazing bunch.

44
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,666
[TOHRU] Oh, it's not
because I'm a dragon.

45
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,708
It's because I'm me.

46
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,625
I suppose it's about time
for me to go shopping.

47
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,791
Any thoughts on
what I should make

48

Hm.

<i>Omurice</i> .

51
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,333
I was just thinking
the same thing!

52
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,500
[KOBAYASHI] But this time,
please make it normal.

53
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,583
Normal, it is!

54
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,291
I'll be back in a bit.

True, but take the house mouse.

60

For example, it only
lives for maybe a year

61
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,666
to a year and a half.

Oh! So sad!

[MALE TV A] Not at all.
Every living creature

to them is a mistake.

I repeat: How long are you
planning to continue this?

The time I have now.
I simply want to enjoy it.

Yes, and I don't think

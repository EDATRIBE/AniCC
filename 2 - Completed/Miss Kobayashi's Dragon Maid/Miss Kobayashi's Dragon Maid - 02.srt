00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,625
[TOHRU]

2
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,333
[KOBAYASHI]
Seriously, Tohru.

3
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,791
What made you think a kitchen
fire was a good plan?

4
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,083
It was more of
an instinct than a plan.

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,000
[KOBAYASHI] You know the
stove makes fire, right?

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,125
[TOHRU] Yes, but I didn't think
it would be strong enough!

7
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,333
[KOBAYASHI]
Strong enough to what?

8
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,708
Incinerate the kitchen?

9
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,916
I worry you may
have brain damage.

10
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,333
[KOBAYASHI]
Which reminds me.

11
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,333
Why've I been letting her
go shopping on her own

12
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,625
this whole time?

13
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,708
Probably not the best idea.

14
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:47,750
But maybe she's not
a disaster there.

15
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:57,750
But maybe she's not
a disaster there.

16
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:07,750
But maybe she's not
a disaster there.

17
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:17,791
But maybe she's not

But maybe she's not

But maybe she's not

00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:57,833
But maybe she's not

22
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:12,583
But maybe she's not
a disaster there.

23
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,333
--[TOHRU] Wait!
--[KOBAYASHI] Huh?

24
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,208
Aren't we going to
the shopping district?

25
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,875
You mean you don't go to
the big supermarket over there?

26
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,458
Oh, no.

27
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,500
That place feels like a castle
and completely freaks me out.

28
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,625
Castle?

29
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,041
Yes, and the whole
thing's white, too.

30
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,875
Gives me flashbacks to run-ins
with crusader's bases.

31
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,625
That's unfortunate.

32
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,458
[TOHRU] The shopping district's
more like the guild's bazaars.

33
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,958
It's a little better.

34
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,625
[KOBAYASHI] So you shop
based on Dragon PTSD.

35
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:37,958
Good to know.

36
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,958
You wanna start by
picking up some fish?

37
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:40,916
[TOHRU]
Sure!

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,125
Tohru! What's up?

39
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,666
--[gasps]
--Good afternoon, Mister Toda.

40
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,708
You're normally out here
alone, aren't you?

41
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,916
Is she a new friend?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,291
No, she's my Master.

43
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,041
--Huh?
--Uh... Hello.

44
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,458
Tohru's a pretty
funny lady, huh?

45
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,791
We've got some good mackerel
in today. Sound good?

46
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,333
[TOHRU]
Hmm... Sounds great!

47
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,041
Let me have two of those
and two dried jack mackerel.

48
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,416
[FISHMONGER A]
Coming up.

49
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,666
[KOBAYASHI] He gave us
an extra fillet of mackerel.

50
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,166
Wasn't that sweet of him?

51
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,416
Why and how are you friends
with the fishmonger?

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,666
Huh? We're not friends, though.

53
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,208
I was just nice to him at first,

54
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,458
so he's been nice to me and
gives me free stuff in return.

55
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,208
--That's all.
--The more I get to know you,

like, at all.

58

Oh! Now, don't worry.
Things are different with us!

59
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,708
We share mutual love!

60

Like "at all"

[BUTCHER A]
Hey there, Tohru!

62
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,625
So what can I get you today?

63
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,833
A little extra included.

64
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,041
[giggles]
That's so sweet!

65
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,875
[KOBAYASHI]
Here, too? This is weird.

66
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,583
Hey, long time no see.

67
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,541
[TOHRU]
Hello.

00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,375
[BOY A]
It's the cosplay lady!

69
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,958
That's me!
Have a good one!

70
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,291
[KOBAYASHI] This dragon's better
at being social than me!

71
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,500
So Miss Condescending
calls us foolish,

72
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,333
inferior humans and what not,
but she's working this crowd

73
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,625
like a champ and
seems to enjoy it.

74
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,125
Maybe she doesn't
hate us, after all.

75
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,250
Didn't mean to keep
you waiting. I'm sorry.

76
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,541
Oh. it's fine.

77
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,083
[KOBAYASHI]
Now that I think about it,

78
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,166
I kinda hardly know
anything about Tohru.

79
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,000
[KOBAYASHI] I think I'd
like to know more. I think.

80
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,166
[KOBAYASHI] Probably best
not to bring up that whole

81
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,083
injury thing, though.

82
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,333
It's clearly a touchy
topic for her.

83
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,166
Wanna grab some dessert, too?

84
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,291
What? You mean it, really?

85
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,416
Sure, what d'ya want?

86
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,208
I would like to have
an éclair, please!

87
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,750
Did you know that the word
"éclair" translates to

88
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,916
"flash of lightning"?

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,166
[KOBAYASHI]
I did not.

90
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,416
Speaking of lightning,
talk to me about Thor.

91
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,416
Is your name related to his?

92
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,708
Absolutely not! It comes from
an author in this world.

93
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,166
At least that's what my
parents have always told me.

94
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,000
Right. Of course
you have parents.

Can you do it without people
knowing you're a dragon?

Yes!

communicate with your friends

173
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,916
Will you please
come back home with me?

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,041
I need you, Lady Tohru.

175
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,166
[TOHRU sighs]

176
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,250
[TOHRU]
I'm not going home.

177
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,208
[gasps]
But why not?

178
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,750
Why?

179
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,083
Because I'm in love
with Miss Kobayashi!

180
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,083
Be serious.

181
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,583
--I knew it!
--[KOBAYASHI] What?!

182
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,333
I saw you on your
little date at the bazaar!

183
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,791
Holding each other's hands
in public. You perverts!

184
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,958
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm sorry, what?

185
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,000
[TOHRU chuckles]

186
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,208
[KOBAYASHI]
Why are you blushing?!

187
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,291
You should know,
if I must, I will kill you.

188
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,916
[gasps]

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,708
Now, die!

190
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,416
[grunting]

191
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,541
[pants]

192
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,083
[grunts]

193
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,541
Kanna. What happened to you?
You're practically powerless.

194
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,666
Your power's special
here, Lady Tohru!

195
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,250
The mana purity
is too low for me!

196
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,375
[KOBAYASHI] Kanna, does that
mean... you can't get home?

197
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,250
[KANNA gasps]

198
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,333
No. That's not true, shut up.

199
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,083
All right. Well, can I ask,
do you have anywhere to stay?

200
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,625
[KANNA gasps]

201
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,500
[KOBAYASHI] Tohru, look me in
the eye and answer for her.

202
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,166
[TOHRU] I can't.
Your dead-fish eyes scare me,

203
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,333
Miss Kobayashi.

204
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,041
Kanna, please tell us
honestly what you're planning.

205
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,375
It's okay.

206
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,625
But if you're after
Miss Kobayashi for yourself,

207
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,458
--you need to give that up--
--Tohru, shut up for a second.

208
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,875
[KANNA whines]
Actually...

209
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,458
You were exiled
for a stupid prank?

210
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,875
[TOHRU] Kanna always has
loved practical jokes.

211
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,916
[KOBAYASHI]
Okay, so long story short...

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,166
--It's like this?
--[BOY B] I'll be good!

213
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,625
--Yes, it's like that.
--Mommy, open up!

214
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,166
I'm sure they want her to
reflect on her actions.

215
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,750
It would be useless for me
to send her back.

216
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,500
[KOBAYASHI] So right now,
she's all on her own.

217
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,625
[TOHRU]
Yes...

218
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,916
[KOBAYASHI]
Kanna?

219
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,583
Do you wanna stay here
with the two of us?

220
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,166
[gasps]

221
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,750
Hold on.

222
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,666
Why'd it take you so much longer
to decide to let me stay, huh?

223
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,166
Once you're stuck with one,
you might as well have two.

224
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,791
Tch! I don't trust
you humans, though!

225
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,541
You must be plotting something!

226
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,541
You just wanna use me!

227
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,666
[gasps]

228
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,125
You can't trust anyone
in an unknown world?

229
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,250
Hey, that makes sense to me.

230
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,000
I wouldn't trust anyone, either.

231
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,791
I think a person
has to earn trust.

232
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,750
And that can only happen
after you become friends

233
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,583
or get, like,
"romantically" involved.

234
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,291
[KANNA whines]

235
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:59,458
Listen, Kanna. I'm not asking
for your trust or friendship.

236
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,916
You can live here. That's all.

237
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:09,583
[KANNA whimpers]

238
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,125
Okay...

239
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,750
--[KOBAYASHI chuckles]
--[KANNA sobs quietly]

240
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,583
[TOHRU]
She's so good.

241
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,666
I'm so glad I fell in love
with Miss Kobayashi.

242
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,458
[KOBAYASHI]
There!

243
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,833
There! There!

244
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,541
Here!

245
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,166
[KOBAYASHI]
How to tame your dragon.

246
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,083
[KANNA]
Shoop!

247
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,125
I want to play!

248
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,375
But the game?

249
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,625
[KANNA]
Yeah, I'm bored with that.

250
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,500
Remember, Kanna's still a child.

251
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,625
She craves physical
exercise to the fullest!

252
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,000
[KOBAYASHI]
What's wrong with video games?

253
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,750
When I was a kid, that's how
I spent all of my time.

254
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,625
Kanna, would you like to go
play outside with me today?

255
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,500
[KANNA]
Mm! Yeah!

256
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,333
Care to join, Miss Kobayashi?

257
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,916
Yes! Please join us!

258
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,166
I don't exercise.

259
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,166
[screams]

260
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,500
And we're... where?

261
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,041
I dunno.

262
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,583
I landed in the first big field
I saw that looked pleasant.

263
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,333
Well, whatever works.

264
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,333
I'll be here sleeping off
the fatigue from my deathma.

265
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,166
Wake me up when
we're finished playing.

266
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,333
Then, figure out
how to get us home.

267
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,250
All right, if that's
what you want.

268
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,458
You ready to play even
if it's just the two of us?

269
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,583
[KANNA]
Mm!

270
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,250
[KOBAYASHI yelps, gasps]

271
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,541
[BOTH grunt]

272
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,791
Tch!

273
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,916
[KANNA gasps]

274
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,625
Wait! Wait, wait!

275
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,500
Oh, hey. I thought
you were gonna take a nap?

276
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,208
[KOBAYASHI] How can I sleep
when you two are trying

277
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,791
to kill each other?!

278
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,875
Don't be silly-- we were only
roughhousing a teeny-tiny bit.

279
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,375
You over-exaggerate.

280
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,125
[KOBAYASHI] Shoot,
I'm at the disadvantage now.

281
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,416
Oh! I bet you wanted to join in,
too, right, Miss Kobayashi?

282
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,125
Shame! You should
be more honest!

283
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,625
[KOBAYASHI]
You'd kill me!

284
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,791
[KANNA groans] It's fun to
move around in a human body.

285
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,125
What happened with you, Kanna?

286
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,291
I thought your strength
had been depleted somehow.

287
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,375
It had been, but the source
of my power is electricity.

288
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,416
It returned after I recharged.

289
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,541
So what, you're made of lithium?

290
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,791
If you're playing,
keep it to human standards.

291
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,416
What? We were at
human standards.

292
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,291
--Huh?
--Huh?

293
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,500
In our world there are
plenty of humans capable

294
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,041
of doing this kind of thing.

295
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,625
[KOBAYASHI] There's very few
who can do it here, like, none.

296
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,291
[TOHRU] That's not true, I saw
some on TV the other day.

297
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,625
[KOBAYASHI] What you saw
was fiction, not reality.

298
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,625
--[BOTH gasp]
--[KOBAYASHI] Oh.

299
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,583
Sorry, for crushing your dreams.

300
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,875
Whatever. I'll be
sleeping in this spot.

301
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,375
Try to keep your playing
around my level.

302
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,000
Sure! Well, there
you have it, Kanna.

303
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,750
Let's start by recalling exactly
how Miss Kobayashi usually acts.

304
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,250
[KANNA]
Okay!

305
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,291
[KOBAYASHI]
The power of dragons.

306
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:37,041
I've seen it a few times now,
but it's still terrifying.

307
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,083
If they wanted to,
this world would be gone.

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,833
[TOHRU]
My lower back! It's killing me!

309
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,791
[KANNA]
I'm tired... I'm gonna die...

310
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,166
[KOBAYASHI] Yeah, never mind.
They'd never destroy our world.

311
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,375
And, for the record,
they've both totally nailed me.

312
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,333
[TOHRU]
Ah, that was super fun.

313
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,750
Was it?

314
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,666
I suppose you really didn't want
to play, Miss Kobayashi.

315
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,791
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmph.

316
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,750
I don't mind playing Word Chain.

317
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:28,708
Indigo.

318
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,708
Gorilla.

319
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,833
Lambskin.

320
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,166
Intercom.

321
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,708
[KANNA]
Compadre.

322
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,041
[TOHRU]
Dre... Dre...

323
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,791
[TOHRU]
Oh, dragon!

324
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,208
[KOBAYASHI]
Ha, ha, you lose.

325
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,666
[TOHRU]
Agh! [laughs]

326
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,125
[KOBAYASHI grunts]

327
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,000
[TOHRU]
Ah! You're being rude.

328
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,291
you only left my
tail-meat behind again!

329
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,250
I said I was ethically opposed.

330
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,083
Although, if you turned
it into ground meat,

331
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,416
I probably wouldn't notice.

332
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,000
But then you would
have no way of knowing

333
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,666
it was specifically my meat.

334
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,708
Why is that so important to you?

335
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,583
--[KOBAYASHI] Hmm?
--Miss Kobayashi...

336
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,750
Please don't enter or
even peek into the kitchen

337
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,875
until I call for you, okay?

338
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,000
Thank you...

339
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,291
Hey!

340
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,250
[KOBAYASHI]
I will never want your tail!

341
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,416
[screams]

342
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,916
[KANNA]
Where are you going, Kobayashi?

343
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,916
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm? To work.

344
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,666
I wanna go with you.

345
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,875
Kanna, you have things to do
with me today, remember?

346
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,333
[KOBAYASHI]
Things like what?

347
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,291
[TOHRU] Kanna hasn't been in
this world for very long.

348
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,666
I thought it would be good for
me to teach her some basics.

349
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,250
Yeah? You thought that?

350
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:46,208
No way! I want Kobayashi!

351
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,583
This came out of nowhere.

352
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,166
If you keep being selfish,
I'll break you.

353
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,083
--[KOBAYASHI] I'm off!
--[TOHRU] Safe travels!

354
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,708
Now then. It's time
for you to learn

355
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,541
common sense for this world.

356
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,416
[KANNA]
What kind of common sense?

357
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,250
[TOHRU] To start with, you need
to learn what you must not do.

358
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh!

359
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,041
[TOHRU] Honor traffic
lights at all times!

360
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,333
Otherwise, you'll be
squashed by a "car."

361
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,791
[KANNA] That's what those
iron boxes are called?

362
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,333
Lady Tohru, you're smart!

363
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,333
[TOHRU chuckles]

364
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,125
[KANNA]
How do they move around?

365
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,916
[TOHRU]
Probably with magic.

366
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,958
Apparently, you need a device
called a "license" for them.

367
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,541
Does Kobayashi have that?

368
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,041
A license?
I'd love to ride in a car!

369
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,375
[TOHRU] From what I understand,
she possesses a license,

370
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,250
but she does not have a car.

371
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,375
Cars impose strains
called "inspections,"

372
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,875
"loans," and "tires."

373
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,125
[KANNA] It seems power comes
at a price in every world.

374
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:39,000
But... wouldn't it be easier
if she just had you carry her?

375
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,375
Why doesn't Kobayashi do that?

376
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,250
Great question.

377
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,958
[TAKIYA] Wow, you've got
another relative with you?

378
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,333
This one a maid, too?

379
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:52,500
Gothic Lolita. A Gothic Lolita
with a tribal theme.

380
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,000
Huh, interesting twist.

381
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,958
[KOBAYASHI] Tohru said she was
gonna teach her some things,

382
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,583
so I'm a little worried.

383
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,416
[TAKIYA] Why? Tohru seems
to have her act together.

384
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,208
You think so?

385
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,625
Well, at the very least,
I'm confident she has

386
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,416
compassion for her friends.

387
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,750
For real? That is hilarious.
Are you serious?

388
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,750
[KANNA]
What's he saying?

389
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,125
[TOHRU]
Magic words.

390
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,041
You can get through
most conversations using

391
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,791
those phrases,
so try to remember them.

392
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,250
[BOYS AND GIRLS
laughing, chatting]

393
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,333
What's that thing?

394
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,583
[TOHRU]
I don't know.

395
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,083
A tool children play with?
How do they play?

396
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,750
It looks like it uses
the principle of levers, but...

397
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,875
[gasps] That's a training
device for catapults!

398
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,500
[KANNA]
Oh!

399
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,625
[TOHRU] This is how human
children learn the means

400
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,875
of combating monsters
in the sky!

401
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,666
[KANNA]
Ooh!

402
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,916
[DRAGON A roars]

403
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,750
What's that?

404
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,416
That's called a crepe stand.

405
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,666
It's sweet, like the
eggs of a yatagarasu.

406
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,541
What's that?

407
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,500
Oh, that's an ice cream stand!

408
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,291
It's cold. But yummy!

409
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,583
[KANNA]
This world is peaceful.

410
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,083
[TOHRU]
It is, isn't it?

411
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,041
Are there dragons here?
Other than visitors.

412
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,541
[TOHRU]
No, it seems there aren't.

413
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,208
I don't know if they went
extinct or if they moved away.

414
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,500
[KANNA] Is it bad to
revert to my original form?

415
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,250
[TOHRU] No, not as long
as you don't allow

416
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,458
that form to be seen.

417
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,333
Have you learned how to use
perception blocking yet, Kanna?

418
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,666
Not yet.

419
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,000
That's okay. Besides,
it's not like there's ever

420
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,458
any real need for it anyways.

421
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,833
Uh. Um, Lady Tohru?

422
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,166
Yes, ma'am?

423
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,666
[KANNA] Why did you decide
to come to this world?

424
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,583
[TOHRU sighs]

425
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:45,333
All the rumors I heard
said that you died.

426
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,833
I was happy to find out
they were wrong.

427
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:48,875
Well, to be honest,

428
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,583
I came to this world
just to escape.

429
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,541
I was on the verge
of death when I got here,

430
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,000
but Miss Kobayashi saved me.

431
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,750
Kobayashi?

432
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,333
I decided to repay her by being
her personal, live-in maid.

433
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,166
Meanwhile, I let people
think I was dead.

434
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,333
I've only told a handful
of dragons about my survival.

435
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,875
Like Miss Lucoah
and Mister Fafnir.

436
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,250
That's neat, you kinda
sound like a retiree.

437
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,083
[chuckles]
I guess I kinda am.

438
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,250
You know what's funny, Kanna?

439
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,750
[TOHRU] I'm very happy.
Right in this moment.

440
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,541
[KANNA]
Hmm.

441
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,916
[TOHRU]
Come on, Kanna!

442
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,416
There's gotta be more stuff
you want to know about!

443
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,541
[KANNA]
Hmm.

444
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,083
I'd like to see
Kobayashi's work.

445
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,208
Uh. She might get mad at you.

446
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,041
[KANNA]
So what? I wanna see.

447
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,333
[TOHRU]
Hmm. Well, all right.

448
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,250
Let's go say hello to her, then.

449
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,125
[TOHRU] Feel free to change.
I blocked perception of us.

450
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,250
[KANNA]
Mm.

451
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,833
[KOBAYASHI groans]

452
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:21,791
[gasps]

453
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,916
What's wrong with you?

454
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Huh? Oh, nothing's wrong.

455
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Whatever.

456
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,250
It's not practice for catapults?

457
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,750
It's not. Just a
toy kids play on.

458
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,666
How about that.

459
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,583
[giggles]

460
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,250
[KANNA]
Whoa.

461
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,750
Whoa, this is fun!

462
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,166
Yeah.

463
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,875
[TOHRU]
This toy is great!

464
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,541
Glad it makes you happy.

465
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,791
[TOHRU] Kanna, supposedly
there are myriads of gods

466
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,083
living in this world.

467
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,000
[KANNA] Lady Tohru,
what does "myriads" mean?

468
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,625
[TOHRU] Basically, gods reside
in all kinds of things here.

469
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,083
[KANNA]
Whoa, that's scary.

470
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,333
[TOHRU]
Don't let your guard down.

471
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,458
[KANNA]
Right.

This place is
completely packed today.

00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,541
Leaving the house
between Christmas

3
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,500
and New Year's is a nightmare.

00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,041
[KANA]
What's that?

5
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,458
It's a lottery.

6
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,916
I wanna do lottery.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,291
We'd need to have tickets.

8
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,041
[TOHRU]
You mean like these?

9
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,083
How'd you get those?

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,041
With magic?

11
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,250
Magic?

12
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,666
No, I got them during
my daily trips here

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,166
to the shopping district.
They just gave them to me.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,750
Assimilated much?

15
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:49,000
[LOTTERY STAFF A] Okay, with
these, you'll get three turns.

16
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,291
[TOHRU] Ooh, the grand prize
is a hot springs vacation!

17
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,291
Oh, yeah.

18
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,625
Hot springs would be nice.

19
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,250
I'm getting that prize!

20
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,125
As long as you don't use magic.

21
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,833
Duh! I know!

22
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,541
[LOTTERY STAFF A]
Here's your consolation prize:

23
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,208
pocket tissues.

24
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,208
[LOTTERY STAFF A]
Pocket tissues.

25
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,416
Last chance, but this time
I'm gonna win or else!

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,083
[KANNA, TOHRU]
Huh?

27
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,583
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

28
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,583
Congratulations!

29
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,250
I won!

30
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,416
Third prize!

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,625
You'll be set for
the winter, now!

Oh!

Ko-what?

35
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,208
[WORKER A] You traveling
anywhere, Yamashita?

36
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,791
[YAMASHITA] Yeah, going
to Hokkaido to see family.

37
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,541
If you want I'll pick up
some nama chocolates

38
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,083
for you as a souvenir.

39
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,833
Nama chocolates.

40
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,291
So, what about you?

41
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,958
You gonna go visit family?

42
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:19,791
Nope.

43
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,083
You got plans?

44
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,958
Well, winter Comiket, obviously.

45
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:23,958
Did you forget?

46
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,208
Ah.

Happy New Year!

52
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,125
[KOBAYASHI] I can't believe how
much has happened this year.

53
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,916
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm here.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,291
Hey, welcome home.

55
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,708
Glad you're back.

56
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,958
[sighs] Done with work
this year, finally.

57
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,208
Congrats, Miss Kobayashi.

58
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,666
Quick question.

59
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,875
That means you don't have
to go to the office anymore?

60
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:58,666
[KOBAYASHI]
Yep.

61
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,166
I'm off through the third.

Oh!

63
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,791
[TOHRU]
You're always so busy.

64
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,333
I hope you'll try
to take it easy

65
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,291
over the rest of the holidays.

66
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,500
[KOBAYASHI]
That is my plan.

67
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,083
[sighs] This is heaven.

68
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,500
I'm glad you won
the <i>kotatsu</i> for us.

00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,958
Yeah, me, too.

70
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,000
I need to move soon
so I can start preparing

71
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,791
the New Year's dishes.

72
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,125
I even borrowed the tools I
need to pound mochi and soba!

73
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,250
You realize you don't have to go
all-out like that, don't you?

74
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,708
It's a maid's responsibility
to make sure any and all

75
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,750
seasonal events are carried out!

76
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:34,958
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm...

77
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,875
Uh-oh. Do you need
to use the restroom?

78
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,416
Don't wanna get up.

79
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,333
Tohru, will you go?

80
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,791
You can do it for me.

81
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,125
Ew.

82
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,458
Okay, fine.

83
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,625
I'll go take care of it.

84
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,583
Hey, uh, since you're up,
you mind hitting

85
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,291
the switch on the rice cooker?

86
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,625

Hey, grab me the remote, too.

87
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,625
What are you doing?

00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,250
Ahh.

00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,916
This is New Year's curry.

According to what I've heard.

00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,041
I can just pound the soba
tomorrow before we eat it.

103
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,416
Tohru, this isn't
too much for you?

104
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,666
No way.

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,416
I'm simply fulfilling
my specific maid duties.

106
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,000

110
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,500
Wonder who it could be.

111
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,166
Looks like we'll never find out.

You better get up.

stupid luck. Coming.

Oh, Miss Sasakibe.

00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,750
Afternoon!

119
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,125
Hungry?

120
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,708
I've got extra candied sweet
potatoes with chestnuts!

121

They're yours if you want 'em.

of those, they look tasty.

Ah! Can you stay there
just a moment, please.

125
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,375
Here, have some
mochi we pounded.

126
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,375
It'll stay good for at least
a month if you freeze it.

127
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,750
Thanks! I adore mochi!

128
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,125
Good work, neighbor.

00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,708

[TOHRU]
Yes, hello?

133
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,041
Good afternoon, Mister Yana.

134
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,125
I brought back way too many
mandarin oranges from home.

135
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,083
You want these? They're sweet.

136
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,583
This is a lot!

137
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,166
Thank you for thinking of us.

If you don't mind holding
on just a second,

139
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,083
I'll grab you some of our mochi!

140
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,291
Good work, again.

141
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,958
[TOHRU]
I guess so.

142
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,208
What's wrong?

143
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,333
It's just, as soon as
I get back under there,

144
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,250
I know someone will come.

145
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,208
[TOHRU]
Maybe not.

00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,083

00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,500
[doorbell rings]

148
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,083
[TOHRU]
Mister Sone.

149
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,958
Is that a rooster?

150
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,791
That's right.

151
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,333
New year, new animal.

152
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,750
Wow, thanks so much.

153
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,291
He's really well made!

154
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,458
And I've got the perfect
place to put him!

155
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,291
Here.

156
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,916
We pounded some extra mochi.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,208
Have some!

158
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,833
You're the best neighbor ever.

159
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,208
This time, it was Mister Sone
with a rooster for us!

160
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,208
[KANNA]
Rooster!

161
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,458
From the zodiac?

162
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,125
[KANNA]
What do those words mean?

163
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,875
[KOBAYASHI] There are twelve
animals in the Chinese zodiac.

164
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,125
Rat, Ox, Tiger...

165
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,958
Let's see, what else?

166
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,083
[TOHRU]
Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse,

167
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:16,041
Ram, Monkey, Rooster,
Dog, and Pig.

168
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,166
Was that a spell?

169
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,791
I'm surprised you know.

170
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,125
It's because I stumbled
across horoscopes online

171
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,458
while I was searching
for all things New Year.

172
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,416
I refuse to accept it, though.

173
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,916
Why's that?

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,708
[TOHRU] Because their big
origin story is that the order

175
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,833
of all the animals was
decided by which ones

176
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,666
reached God the fastest on
the morning of the New Year.

177
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,083
[KOBAYASHI] Oh, right.
I totally forgot about that.

178
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,333
The Rat stole first place
by sneaking a ride on the Ox.

179
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,500
[KOBAYASHI] So, what's the part
about it you "refuse to accept"?

180
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,166

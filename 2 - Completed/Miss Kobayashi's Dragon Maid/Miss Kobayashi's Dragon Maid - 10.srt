1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,125
Oh...

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,166
[TOHRU]
Christmas, huh?

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,083
I do hate the idea of
celebrating the birth

4
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,041
of You-Know-Who's son,
but I gotta say,

5
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,625
it sounds like a good time.

6
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,416
Tohru, hey!

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,791
[TOHRU]
Hey back!

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,083
Oh, no!

9
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,375
What happened to you?

10
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,041
[BUTCHER A] Unfortunately,
I was practicing for

11
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,500
the local retirement home's
annual Christmas Eve show,

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,375
but I ended up injuring myself.

13
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,916
Ah...

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You must feel so
weak and flimsy.

15
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,333
Oh, hey!

16
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,708
Tohru, do you think you
might be willing to put on

17
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,375
the show in my stead?

18
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,666
Uh?

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,041
The residents in the home
were looking forward

20
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,666
to the event, so I feel like
I'm letting them down.

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,791
Put on a show?

22
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,166
Are you serious?

23
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,416
Yes, of course.

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
No one could represent
our shopping district

25
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:56,958
better than you!

26
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,208
Okay, we'll do it!

27
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,291
And don't worry, it'll be super!

28
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,000
[TOHRU giggles]

29
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,208
[TOHRU]
And so I'm totally gonna do it!

30
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,333
Are you sure?

31
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,708
Sure, I'm sure!

32
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,708
I'd like to help out,
too, but I can't.

33
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,375
I have stupid work.

34
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,041
That's all right,
Miss Kobayashi.

35
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,416
You just stay
focused on your job,

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
and I'll take care
of everything.

37
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,375
Whatever. If you say so.

38
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,791
[TOHRU laughs]
It'll be easy.

39
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,041
All I gotta do is ask my
reliable and free friends

40
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,583
to help me out!

41
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,000
Ready, everyone?

42
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,500
Let's put on a show!

43
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,791
[BOTH]
Yeah!

44
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,375
[BOTH]
Um. Yeah.

45
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,458
Wait a second!

46
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,750
Jeez, what is it?

47
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,791
Have I been lied to?
Because I was told I could

48
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,208
eat as much candy as
I wanted if I came here.

49
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,000
I even made room in my
schedule even though

50
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,916
it's one of the busiest
times of the year!

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,833
Miss Kobayashi told me
the truth about you, Elma.

52
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,416
You're completely
useless at work.

53
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,750
Uh--

54
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,125
So much so that they've
even announced they didn't

55
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,000
need you to be in
their way right now.

56
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,500
Ah... It doesn't make any sense!

57
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,541
Now I can actually
type with my fingers!

58
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,833
What else can I do when
I can't afford to interfere

59
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,458
with this world?

60
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,458
Believe me, you're already
interfering plenty.

61
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,458
[ELMA groans]

62
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,458
Question.

63
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,208
Why isn't Kanna's
mom doing this?

64
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,708
Unlike Elma, Miss Kobayashi
is busy with her work, so,

65
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,583
it's up to us to take
care of this on our own!

66
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,958
What do ya say?

67
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,666
Boring.

68
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,000
I heard something
important was happening.

69
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,083
Turns out it was just
something pathetic instead.

70
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,166
Oh, come on, Fafnir!

71
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,416
Let's keep an eye
on how it goes.

72
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,791
[ELMA]
Well, then.

73
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,250
What exactly do you want
us to do for this show?

74
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,333
I think, to start off with,
it should probably be

75
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,833
something the elderly
would enjoy watching.

76
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:07,750
That works for me.

77
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,208
Any other ideas?

78
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:09,833
I know!

79
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,333
An eating contest!

80
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,208
No.

81
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,833
You just wanna stuff your face.

82
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:14,833
How 'bout a race?

83
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,458
[LUCOA]
That might kill them.

84
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:20,208
We should play a VR FPS,
FFA, AKA frag fest.

85
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,916
[LUCOA]
I'm sorry, could you use words?

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,541
But all of these ideas require
the audience to participate.

87
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,833
You can't judge us
when you haven't

88
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,666
actually proposed anything!

89
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,291
Do the two of you
have any suggestions?

90
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,666
I'm okay with whatever.

91
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,291
Okay, so, what if
we put on a play?

92
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,666
Wait, a play?

93
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,583
Is that where humans pretend
to be different humans

94
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,583
on a globe stage
that's not a globe?

95
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,875
Globe stage that's what?

96
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,750
[TOHRU]
A play, huh?

97
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,041
That's perfect!

98
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,458
Let's put on a play!

99
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,041
Fine.

100
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,083
We will put on a play, but what
do you think we should put on?

101
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,083
Since it's Christmas time,
why not <i>The Little Match Girl</i> ?

102
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,291
Ooh, that sounds funny.

103
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,583
Is it funny?

104
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,000
[SAIKAWA]
Um, no.

105
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,791
It's about this poor little
girl selling matchsticks

106
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,416
on a very cold winter's night.

107
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,375
Sadly, no one will buy
any matches from her.

108
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,833
So, in order to warm
her chilled body,

109
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,458
she lights one of the matches.

110
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,791
Then, in the flame,
she sees a warm stove

111
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,625
and lots of delicious food.

112
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,250
She lights match after
match, and eventually,

113
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,958
her beloved and yet
very much dead grandmother

114
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,291
appears to her.

115
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,666
The little girl continues
lighting her matches

116
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,208
to keep her grandmother
from disappearing,

117
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:33,041
until finally, the grandmother
gently hugs the little girl.

118
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,541
Then the little girl
ascends to Heaven,

119
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:39,208
embraced in her grandmother's
warmth and love.

120
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,416
It's kind of a
sad story, and gosh,

121
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,208
it gets me every time.

122
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,375
Yeah, it's pretty famous.

123
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,708
Oh.

124
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,708
So, what happens after the
girl ascends to Heaven?

125
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,291
Does she sell her matchsticks?

126
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,583
Idiot.

127
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,791
The girl ascends to Heaven
because she's dead.

128
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,000
Wow.

129
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,083
That woman strangled
her own granddaughter.

130
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,083
Die!

131
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,458
[ELMA]
No, that's not it either.

132
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,875
You know a lot,
Saikawa. It's so cool.

133
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,958
Uh-- Yeah, I guess.

134
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,250
It's no big deal.

135
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,916
I'm good with putting on
<i>The Little Match Girl</i>

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,416
if you guys are!

137
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,291
[GROUP]
Yeah!

138
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,041
Sure hope we don't blow it.

139
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,625
Fafnir will obviously
be directing.

140
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,458
Keep in mind,
Fafnir will not stand for

141
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,458
any sophomoric performances.

142
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,916
Fafnir is the
absolute authority.

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,958
Challenge him and
you will suffer.

144
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,208
[BOTH gasp]

145
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,041
Also, keep in mind
Fafnir's only the director

146
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,500
because he can't act.

147
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,541
Now, come on nepotism!

148
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,375
Before anything,
Fafnir needs to cast

149
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,000
the lead of this play.

150
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,875
He wants each of you
to audition for the role

151
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,291
of Little Match Girl.

152
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,166
Yay! I can go first!

153
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,916
Tohru, auditioning for
Little Match Girl.

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,208
[FAFNIR]
Just get started.

155
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,833
Do not disappoint Fafnir.

156
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:45,958
Matchstick.

157
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,750
Oh, please, won't
anyone buy a match?

158
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,333
Boring. Next.

159
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,541
What? Already?

160
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,208
[FAFNIR]
I'll give you one more shot.

161
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,708
This time, see those
heartless humans ignoring you

162
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,833
like the trash you are.

163
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,541
[gasps]

164
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,791
[FAFNIR]
Feel it.

165
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,083
Then, allow the lines
to flow naturally.

166
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,791
[TOHRU]
Feel it, huh?

167
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,333
Why, you foolish,
inferior humans!

168
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,916
How dare you ignore me
to suffer like this?

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,666
--I'll make you pay for--
--[FAFNIR] Fail. Next.

170
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,958
Hello, my name is Elma,
and I'm unrepresented.

171
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,083
Matches?

172
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,583
Do you need any matches?

173
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,583
I don't.

174
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:18,458
[ELMA]
Please, sir!

175
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,666
Please at least hear me out!

176
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,541
I can't go back to the office
until I've sold them all.

177
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,208
[FAFNIR]
What are you doing?

178
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,291
The salesmen that come
to our company always

179
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,916
put on a performance like that.

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
[FAFNIR]
Sucks for them.

181
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,583
Next.

182
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,708
Good afternoon!

183
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,166
I'm Riko Saikawa.

184
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,583
Thank you for your time.

185
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,000
Ah!

186
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,083
I... Uh...

187
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,625
[SAIKAWA whimpers]

188
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,833
Oh, god, why?

189
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,666
I'm so sorry!

190
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,416
[FAFNIR] To be honest,
none of you are any good.

191
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,666
[TOHRU]
To be extra honest,

192
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,916
your directing style is
way too sadistic for us.

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,166
Ooh, me!

194
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,416
[TOHRU]
Yeah, you what?

195
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,541
[LUCOA]
Let me direct.

196
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,833
I can be nice and firm!

197
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,458
And I'll make Shouta the lead.

198
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,416
Uh--

199
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,083
What are you even talking about?

200
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,416
Shouta's a boy,
not a little girl.

201
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,083
Well, you just leave that to me.

202
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,250
Shouta, baby, come here.

203
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,500
[ALL]
Ooh...

204
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,958
[ELMA]
He looks just like a girl!

205
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,291
[KANNA]
So cute.

206
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,583
[TOHRU]
Yeah, I'll buy it.

207
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,375
[SAIKAWA]
I dunno.

208
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,333
He's not as cute as Kanna.

209
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,041
Wha...

210
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,083
[ALL]
"Wha"?

211
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,333
What are you all
planning to achieve

212
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,375
--by embarrassing meee?
--[LUCOA] Shouta, baby,

213
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,250
--by embarrassing meee?
--come back!

214
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,875
Well, that was to be expected.

215
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,375
C'mon, cheer up, sweetie.

216
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,125
[TOHRU]
What should we do, now?

217
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,208
[ELMA]
I can be the director.

218
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,166
I'll at least be better
than those two.

219
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,833
[TOHRU]
That's true.

220
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,291
Any thoughts on who we
should make our lead?

221
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,208
Matches.

222
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,583
Matches.

223
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,291
Please buy some matches.

224
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,041
[yelps]

225
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,625
[squeals]

226
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,625
[ELMA, TOHRU]
Mm-hm! Perfect!

227
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,291
[KOBAYASHI]
Hey, guys, I'm home.

228
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,333
[KANNA]
Matches.

229
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,750
Do you wanna buy
any matches, please?

230
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Mind filling me in?

231
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,500
We decided to perform
<i>The Little Match Girl</i>

232
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,541
for our show at the
retirement home.

233
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,875
Kanna has been cast
as the title character.

234
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,833
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh, I see.

235
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,583
Congratulations, Kanna!

236
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,708
[KANNA]
Mm-hm. I'm excited.

237
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,791
I promise to come see you.

238
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,250
You sure you'll be okay?

239
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,750
Of course we will!

240
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,625
There's no way a play
can take down a dragon.

241
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,750
Right.

242
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,625
Do you want to buy
any matches, please?

243
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,291
[KOBAYASHI] She's at
her most dangerous

244
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,458
when she gets like this.

245
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,666
[KOBAYASHI]
If you say so.

246
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,875
--[KANNA] Match?
--I'm gonna go take a bath.

247
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,000
--[TOHRU] 'Kay!
--Matches?

248
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,541
[phone ringing]

249
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,500
Coming, phone.

250
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,291
Hello, Kobayashi residence.

251
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,541
[FAFNIR]
It's me.

252
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,125
I thought about the
script some on my own.

253
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,458
You're still not gonna
be the director,

254
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,625
so if it's that, let it go.

255
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,625
Otherwise, what did
you come up with?

256
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,125
[FAFNIR] If we stick
to the original play,

257
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,916
it won't match the current era.

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,583
So, I decided to make the little
match girl into a magical--

259
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,791
[TOHRU] All right then, time to
prepare Miss Kobayashi's dinner.

260
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,833
Do you want to buy
any matches, please?

261
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,750
Lady Tohru, is there a
chimney in this house at all?

262
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,833
Is there a chimney?

263
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,375
No, why do you ask?

264
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,000
[KANNA] Because Saikawa told me
that Santa visits your house

265
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,750
by coming down the chimney.

266
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,125
Oh, yeah, you mean that old man
who's covered in blood?

267
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,541
Ho!

268
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,791
[KANNA] Do you think Santa will
still try to visit us?

269
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,708
[TOHRU]
Hm...

270
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,000
Yes!

271
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,750
[KOBAYASHI]
Hm?

272
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,583
[gasps]

273
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,541
[KOBAYASHI]
What the crap?

274
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,833
[ELMA]
What are you doing?!

275
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,958
No, no!

276
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,125
How many times do I
have to tell you?

277
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,291
No, where do you
think you're going?

278
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,000
Tohru! Why would a rando use
Kobayashi as reason to refuse

279
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,166
to buy matches?

280
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,666
Yeah, well, why would
I be in a hurry if

281
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,958
I wasn't doing
something for her?

282
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,458
[ELMA]
Not my problem!

283
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,833
Lucoa! The grandmother would
not try to warm the girl up

284
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,041
while practically nude.

285
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:22,958
[LUCOA]
Why not?

286
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,625
It's much warmer this way.

287
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,125
[ELMA] Fafnir, you're
completely out of line.

288
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,375
A human father would never call
his daughter a "mere human."

289
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,041
Focus!

290
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,250
[ELMA] Why is accepting this
script such an ordeal?

291
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,500
[TOHRU] Well, I don't think
it translates that well,

292
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,125
culturally speaking.

293
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,833
Not to mention it's
slow and repetitive

294
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,500
and might bore the audience.

295
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,916
[ELMA] True, and we don't
want that to happen.

296
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,416
Then why don't we try
changing things up just a bit?

297
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,166
What are you suggesting we do?

298
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,541
Nothing too extreme.

299
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,833
I mean, I think
at the very least,

300
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,291
we should make it more fun.

301
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,000
That sounds good to me!

302
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,833
[TOHRU] Why don't we mix
other myths in with it,

303
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,708
like the Kasa Jizou story!

304
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,916
Like we have the old man
selling hats next to the girl.

305
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,166
[ELMA]
Or we could follow the script.

306
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,833
[LUCOA]
I like it.

307
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,125
[FAFNIR] The main character
should be a magical girl.

308
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,833
She can obtain power
to burn this corrupt world,

309
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,500
burn it to ash.

310
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,625
[ELMA] Now there's nothing
from the original left.

311
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,500
[LUCOA]
You know, I've heard <i>47 Ronin</i>

312
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,916
is popular with the elderly.

313
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,458
[FAFNIR]
Oh, yes, the one about humans

314
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,208
and their quest for revenge.

315
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,375
I can appreciate that.

316
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,958
[KANNA]
Are there any dragons?

317
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,250
[LUCOA] We might as well have
some while we're at it, right?

318
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,500
[ELMA]
Hey, Grandma!

319
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,583
Stop making it sexy!

320
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,833
Narrator, stop grinning
like an idiot!

321
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,250
[TOHRU]
Kanna.

322
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,416
From what I've heard, this
Santa guy won't be coming by

323
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,833
for a little while longer.

324
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,750
[KANNA]
Does Santa know where we are?

325
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,000
Will he really come?

326
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,375
[TOHRU] I guess we'll
have to wait and see.

327
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,666
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm exhausted.

328
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,333
[KOBAYASHI]
What the crap?

329
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,750
--Merry Christmas!
--Still have some cake left!

[OLD FOLK murmuring]

332
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,125
Are we too late?

00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,666
--[TAKIYA] No, we're good.
--It's just about to start.

334
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,208
All right, now the performance

335
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,958
of <i>The Little Match Girl</i>
brought to you by

336
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,666
the wonderful Oborozuka
Shopping District.

337
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,416
Please enjoy the show.

[applause]

The City.

340
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,250
It was terribly cold that night.

341
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,625
A light shone upon
the street corner.

342
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,083
Standing in that light
was a girl selling matches.

343
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,583
Matches.

344
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,666
Do you want to buy any matches?

345
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,916
[SAIKAWA] Unfortunately, no one
wanted to buy her matches.

346
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
[KANNA]
I can't sell any.

347
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,583
[SHOUTA]
Umm.

348
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,291
Excuse me, young girl.

349
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,708
would you like to buy some hats?

350
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,041
Huh?

351
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,583
[SAIKAWA] Before her
appeared an old man selling

352
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,791
very strong hats.

353
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,125
I'm an old man,
and my old wife made

354
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,958
these hats for me to sell.

355
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,541
Oh, they're very strong.

356
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,666
I do not have any money.

357
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,291
Are you all right?

358
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,291
I'm cold.

359
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,291
That must be difficult.

360
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,750
Here, you can burn one
of these to get warm!

361
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,750
Burn the hat?

362
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,750
Odd choice since
his wife made it!

363
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,375
They're actually
setting it on fire!

364
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,125
[SAIKAWA] Then something
unexpected happened.

365
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:19,916
A strange smoke appeared,
and with it, a suspicious man.

366
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,833
Look, pathetic humans.

367
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,125
Who are you, sir?

368
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,833
What do you want?

369
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,583
You have been chosen.

370
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,458
You will be a magical girl
with a duty to bear.

371
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,666
I did not see that one coming.

372
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,458
I grant unto you the power
to correct and punish

373
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,208
this corrupt world!

374
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:36,958
Okay!

375
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,500
That was quick!

376
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,583
Very good.

377
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,541
--Let us go.
--Wait! Me, too!

378
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,708
I want to be...

379
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,333
...a magical girl!

380
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,708
[FAFNIR] Why do you wish
to be a magical girl?

381
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,833
So I can use my power to
commit many nefarious deeds.

382
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,500
I need the money, you see.

383
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,250
My wife is very poor and dying
from a terrible sickness!

384
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,208
Why wouldn't he just heal her
with his magical power?

385
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,333
You would dare voice
your desires like that

386
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,083
without any shame, old man?

387
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,375
Acceptable.

388
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,000
You shall be a
magical girl, too.

389
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,083
[SHOUTA]
Oh. This is embarrassing.

390
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,666
But, unfortunately,

391
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,333
I only have one staff that will
allow you to use your powers.

392
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,375
You will fight, and the
survivor shall have the staff.

393
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,291
Now!

394
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,166
[LUCOA]
No, you must not fight!

395
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,291
I am a magic fairy.

396
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,625
Do not let yourselves be fooled
by that suspicious man's offer.

397
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,458
Hmph!

398
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,916
[OLD FOLK]
Ooh...

399
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,250
I shall not allow you to toy
with the hearts of others.

400
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,625
Leave this to me and go,
little girl and old man girl!

401
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,250
No, magic fairy, we cannot
just leave you here.

402
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,416
That's right!

403
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,541
You are so kind.

404
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,875
Our time together
was very enjoyable.

405
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,750
I shall never forget you two!

406
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,250
It was seconds.

407
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,125
No way.

408
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,125
Do you know what
we should do now?

409
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,583
A magical girl's role
is to cleanse corruption

410
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,833
from this world, right?

411
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,208
I'm on it!

412
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,750
Where are all the bad
and rotten people?

413
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,791
[SAIKAWA] Incredibly, the spell
cast by the young girl

414
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,250
struck a devastating blow
to a nearby mansion.

415
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,541
Let's go look over there.

416
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,708
[BOTH] Run, run, run,
run, run, run, run.

417
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,083
Are you the two responsible for
setting this place on fire?

418
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,458
No, what? Who would
do such a mean thing?

419
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,000
[BOTH]
So guilty.

420
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:37,958
I'm very sorry.

421
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,625
I meant nothing ill by it.

422
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,916
It's cool. Don't worry.

423
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I am Kuranosuke Oishi.

424
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,000
Thanks to this fire,
I can easily sneak into

425
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,875
the Kira mansion, so you
have my utmost gratitude.

426
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,750
What are you doing here?

427
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,708
I've come to finally
avenge my lord and claim

428
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,541
the head of Kira Kouzuke
No Suke Yoshinaka!

429
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,250
Now it's the <i>47 Ronin</i> ?

430
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:01,375
[TOHRU screams]

431
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,625
Avenging your lord?

432
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,041
Hilarious!

433
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,791
Prepare yourself, Kira!

434
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,083
If you'd forfeit
your life, come!

435
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,458
She did not just do that!

436
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,458
That's the source
of the corruption.

437
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,791
And the enemy of
all magical girls!

438
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,375
[yelps] No!

439
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,250
[TOHRU laughs]
No one can beat me in this:

440
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,500
my final and ultimate form.

441
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,708
I'll turn you into dust!

442
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,916
They have to stop
before they lose control!

443
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,166
That's amazing.

444
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,291
This must be that CGI!

445
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,583
Ya darn right I'm spry!

446
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,583
--[OLD MAN B] No, CGI.
--[ELMA] All right.

447
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,500
[ELMA] Then, I'll have
to get serious, too!

448
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,041
[TOHRU]
I dare you!

449
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:10,750
[applause]

450
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,291
[giggles]

451
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,375
What an incredible show!

[KANNA]

453
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,125
So, what did you think?

454
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,166
We were amazing, right?

455
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,458
Uhh.

456
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,875
Yes, you were.

457
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,125
I'm proud that you did it
all on your own, too.

458
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,375
Good job, Tohru.

459
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,708
Thank you!

00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,333
Does anybody wanna join
me for an after party?

461

Let's do it!

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,083

cake they gave us!

00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,708
You just wanna stuff
your face again.

465
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,458
What? That is not at all true.

466
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,833

00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,875
Where is everyone?

471
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,416
They just left to
head to their homes.

472
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,916
Apparently, they're each
having their own,

473
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,125
individual parties, too.

474
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,500
What about Kanna?

475
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,750
[TOHRU]
She escorted Miss Saikawa home.

476
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,375
[TOHRU]
Would you like a bath?

477
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:39,000
Or are you too tired
to mess with that tonight?

478
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,083
Well.

479
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,375
Since it's Christmas,
I have an idea.

[TOHRU]
This is unusual.

485
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,291
You've never asked me
to see the view at night.

486
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,416
That's weird.

Oh.

[TOHRU]
Yes!

493
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,291
I got you some medicine that
works well for lower back pain.

For real? That's so sweet!

495

[TOHRU] It's a valuable item
in the other world!

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,250
You grind it down and apply
it to your achy areas.

It works exquisitely!

00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,375
Yeah.

00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,833
Right.

Ya know, I was worried
about you all day today.

[TOHRU]
What for?

502
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,041
What do you mean?

503
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,791
[KOBAYASHI] To be honest,
I was super anxious

504
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,708
while watching your play.

505
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:45,166
Kept worrying if and when I
should jump in to stop you.

506
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,375
But then, I realized
everyone loved it.

the excellent performance!

"Look, pathetic humans."

Stop it.

[TOHRU] "Huh? Why do you wish
to be a magical girl?"

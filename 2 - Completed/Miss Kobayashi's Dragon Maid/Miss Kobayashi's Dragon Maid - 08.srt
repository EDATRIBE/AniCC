00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:13,666
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm.

00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,666
[KANNA]
Kobayashi?

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,791
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,041
[KANNA]
Here.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,625
A bento lunch?

6
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,666
[KANNA]
Mm-hmm. It's for next week.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,208
I've got a field trip.

8
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,541
Oh!

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,875
Make one!

10
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,541
Okay. What kind of
food do you prefer?

11
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,875
[KANNA]
Hmm...

12
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,166
[TOHRU] Don't worry about
that, Miss Kobayashi.

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,750
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

14
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,958
I can take care of it. Domestic
creativity is kinda my thing!

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,833
[KOBAYASHI growls]

16
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,375
Oh? Is that so?

17
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,458
Um, yeah. I'm only
the best there ever was!

18
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,541
[KOBAYASHI]
That's funny,

19
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,000
because I'm even
better than the best.

20
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,625
Well, I'm better than
"even better than the best."

21
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:55,625
[KOBAYASHI]
Sure.

22
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,541
According to... you.

23
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,583
Care to prove your
so-called betterness,

24
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,083
or are you scared?

25
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,625
Careful there, Tohru.

26
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,416
You're good, but
you're not that good.

27
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:16,541
Uh-oh. An inciting incident.

28
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,791
[TOHRU, KOBAYASHI]
It's on!

29
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,291
Ready to lose?

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,041
[TOHRU, KOBAYASHI]
Three rounds!

Bento Lunch Competition!

32
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,666
Of course you guys would make
a game show set for this.

33
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,875
[FAFNIR]
You'll each make three dishes:

34
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,791
a salad, a main course,
and a dessert.

35
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,875
Use all your skills.
Entertain me!

36
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:18,708
[KOBAYASHI]
What is your character

37
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,625
even supposed to be anymore?

38
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,291
Ingredients are up to you.

39
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,500
But remember to stay within the
budget as you compete.

40
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,750
We don't wanna strain
Miss Kobayashi's wallet, do we?

41
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,958
[giggles]

42
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,166
--[KOBAYASHI] Hey!

Begin!

44
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,708
They both really
want to win this.

45
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,333
Who knew Kobayashi cared?

46
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,500
[LUCOA]
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm!

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,291
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm...

48
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,208
[TOHRU, KOBAYASHI]
Finished!

00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,625
[LUCOA]
First dish: complete!

50
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,166
Let's see.

51
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,583
Contestant Kobayashi appears
to be serving cherry tomatoes.

52
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,333
Did you just throw the match?

53
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,333
You can't possibly
expect to beat a seafood

54
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,958
and paprika Caesar.

55
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,333
I mean, there's no comparison.

56
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,041
[FAFNIR] Agreed.
There's no need to compare.

57
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,791
The winner of
the salad round is...

58
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,083
...Kobayashi.

59
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,000
What?! How'd I lose?!

60
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,250
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmph.

61
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,625
[TOHRU]
I can't accept this!

62
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:30,083
How could my salad extravaganza
lose to two tomatoes?

63
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:34,166
Calm down. Allow me to explain
your first round failure.

64
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,750
Now, then.

65
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,000
The problem, Contestant Tohru,
is that you were not prepared

66
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,916
because you didn't bother
to find out the definition

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,791
of a bento lunch.

68
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,541
There was limited space.

69
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,541
And you made too much!

70
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,250
[TOHRU growls]

71
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,041
Heh.

72
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,166
[squeals]

73
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,250
That's all right.

74
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,833
I'll win next!

75
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,000
--[FAFNIR] Tohru wins.
--[KANNA] Lady Tohru.

76
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,166
[KOBAYASHI]
Bacon and eggs can't lose!

77
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,708
Hamburger's better, though.

78
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,291
But bacon and eggs
are a delicious staple!

79
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,083
[KANNA]
Hamburger's better.

80
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,416
[KOBAYASHI]
No, it's not...

81
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,833
Although, when I was a kid...

82
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,666
...I always asked my
parents to make burgers...

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,458
[FAFNIR]
Last round is dessert.

84
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,708
Something in a cup,
or a fruit would work.

85
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,458
You are to bring one item
that has not been cooked.

86
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,750
'Kay.

--[LUCOA] Tohru.

88
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,375
[LUCOA]
This is rather unusual.

89
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,000
You and Kobayashi
don't normally fight.

90
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,500
No, we don't.

91
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,625
Not ever.

92
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,041
So why...?

93
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,125
[TOHRU]
I'm heading off.

94
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,666
[LUCOA]
Be careful.

95
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,083
[FAFNIR]
This is deplorable.

96
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,166
What do you mean?

97
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,666
I love seeing Tohru like this.
It's refreshing!

98
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,333
It's the final round,
oh, what am I going to get?

00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,125
Hold on. I know!

100
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,875
Of course. It's perfect!

[TOHRU giggles]

102
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,291
[LUCOA] You realize
this fight only happened

103
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,458
because you've grown
so close to each other.

104
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,958
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

105
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,291
[LUCOA] I mean,
you're fighting but you're not,

107
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,875
Either way, it's not a big deal.

She may be a dragon maid.
but she can be my friend, too.

Excuse me.

110
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:40,416
You cannot honestly believe that
you and a dragon are equals...

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,916

Mm-hmm.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,333
Huh?

114
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,666
That's at least how
Tohru and I both feel about it.

115
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,041
Probably why we
fought today, too.

116

Good grief.
Why is Tohru not back yet?

seen this before.

00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,083
they look like they're about
to explode any second.

179
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,125
You think they'll be okay?

180
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,500
[KANNA]
I can't say.

181
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,083
Last time they fought,
three islands disappeared.

182
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,833
[KOBAYASHI]
That's awful!

183
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,625
[ELMA] Hmph. Our power may be
considered equal by some...

184
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,250
...but this time,
I plan on settling the score!

185
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,083
[stomach growls]

186
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,333
Her stomach just
growled like no big whoop.

187
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,041
I'd be mortified, but dragons
don't care about that stuff.

188
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,833
--After all-- [gasps]
--[ELMA whimpers]

189
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,750
[KOBAYASHI] Or maybe not.
She looks embarrassed.

190
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,916
Shut up, human!

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,750
You are being very
distracting right now!

192
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,166
[KOBAYASHI] Hmm? Well, you've
got quite the attitude on ya

193
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,166
considering you just
destroyed my home.

194
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,708
[ELMA gasps]

195
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,875
[KOBAYASHI] Maybe you should
follow the laws in this world

196
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,791
before you try protecting it.

197
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,250
Even Tohru wouldn't do
something like this.

198
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,166
[ELMA]
Uh... Sorry...

199
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,208
[KOBAYASHI]
Prob'ly.

200
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,833
[ELMA]
I'm sorry!

201
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,250
Wait. Why do I always
wind up doing the apologizing?!

202
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,000
[KOBAYASHI]
That says a lot.

203
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,583
Hey. She doesn't seem
like a bad person,

204
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,583
so why don't you all get along?

205
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,625
Because we're from
different factions.

206
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,958
Not all dragons are
united in thought.

207
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,833
There's the harmony faction
that values law and order,

208
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,958
the chaos faction that yearns
for chaos and destruction,

209
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,666
and the spectating faction
that doesn't work

210
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,791
with either group
or even each other.

211
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,000
[KOBAYASHI]
Wow.

212
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,208
[TOHRU] Elma belongs to
the harmony faction.

213
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,083
I'm with chaos, obviously.

214
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,958
So we oppose each other.

215
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,541
[KOBAYASHI] Hold up:
you're one of the villains?

216
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,291
[TOHRU]
No, no, that is not true.

217
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,791
I am a good dragon, and I'm
on my very best behavior

218
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,750
in this world.

219
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,250
That sounded a bit forced.

220
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,625
Sorry to interrupt!

221
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:09,458
But I'm taking you home, Tohru!
By force, if I must.

222
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,833
Yeah? Try it!

223
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,833
I'll eliminate you from this
world and leave no trace

224
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,208
of your filth behind!

225
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,666
Take it somewhere else!

226
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:22,916
I've prepared another dimension.
We can finish this there.

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,125
What's wrong?

228
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,625
[ELMA]
Nothing.

229
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,416
[ELMA] I'm just surprised
to see the fiendish Tohru

230
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,875
listening to a human.
What in this world happened?

231
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,666
[ELMA]
Hurry up!

232
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,875
[TOHRU growls]

233
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,041
[KOBAYASHI]
Hey! You cheated!

234
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,416
Who, me? No, I simply respected
order like she wanted.

235
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,791
It was a peaceful resolution.

236
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,041
Now then,
would you like me to fix

237
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,958
what she so
carelessly destroyed?

238
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,416
[KOBAYASHI] By the way,
where'd you send her?

239
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,166
[TOHRU] The field Kanna and I
played in that one time.

240
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,208
[ELMA]
U-Uh... Uh... Oh, man...

241
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,833
Where am I?

242
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,000
[doorbell rings]

243
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,958
How dare you trick me?!

244
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,458
You actually came back here?

245
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,875
[ELMA] I can't believe you
sent me to another continent!

246
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,791
Can we stop this?
I'm not gonna do anything.

247
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,083
I'll be happy as long as I can
quietly be a maid in this world.

248
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,791
Hey, Tohru?
What's going on?

249
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,458
The freak decided to come back.

250
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,958
[ELMA]
Oh, yeah, I'm the freak?!

251
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,625
You're planning to take over
this world, just admit it!

252
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,750
[TOHRU]
Hmph. You're wrong.

253
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,875
[ELMA] Shut your mouth!
No more excuses!

254
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,166
[stomach growls]

255
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,750
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh, you poor thing...

256
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,291
[ELMA groans]

257
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,250
You haven't had any food
to eat since yesterday,

258
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,375
have you?

259
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,875
[ELMA]
I can't...

260
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,541
I'm not from this world...
so I'm not allowed to interfere.

261
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,166
Oh.

262
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,083
Here, something like this
should be all right, yeah?

263
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,125
Come on. Try some.
It's cream bread.

264
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,166
Thank you...

265
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,458
I'll kindly take you
up on the offer.

266
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,583
If only to restore my strength.

267
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,958
[ELMA gasps]
What's this?

268
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,916
It's melting in my mouth!

269
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,708
I think I just ate heaven!

270
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,166
[TOHRU growls]

271
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,125
[ELMA]
All right. I'm energized now!

272
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,958
Time for us to have
that rematch, Tohru!

273
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,208
Or you could go away.

274
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,500
If you do, I'll let you
have all of these.

275
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,583
[ELMA]
Sorry for the intrusion!

276
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,208
[SHOUTA groans]

277
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,500
[SHOUTA]
Too big, way too big...

278
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,541
I'm being crushed...

279
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,000
[PINK FRUIT howls]

280
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,625
Who's this?

281
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,583
[ELMA] I'll be working
with you starting today.

282
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,791
My name is Elma Joui.

283
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,083
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

284
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,166
No way!

285
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,875
What the heck is going on?
Why are you here?

286
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,083
I could ask you the same
question, human.

287
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,291
This is my work,
so I get to ask stuff.

288
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,208
This cannot be just a
coincidence, can it?

289
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:15,458
[ELMA] I'm investigating...
It's cultural standard research.

290
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,208
I wanna see if beings from
other worlds can really

291
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,666
integrate successfully.

292
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,958
That makes sense.

293
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,250
She did say you were with
the harmony faction.

294
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,375
Wait, can you even do this job?

295
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,541
You know you can't use magic.

296
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,291
[ELMA]
Hmph. Don't be silly!

297
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,416
Trust me. I can do human
labor better than any human.

298
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,958
You just watch and learn!

299
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,583
[ELMA]
What the heck is this...?

300
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,375
I don't understand any of it.

301
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,041
What are these bizarre boxes?

302
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,375
And what is everyone
doing with them?

303
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,583
Ooh! I think I did something!

304
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,625
[KOBAYASHI]
Yeah. Try this.

305
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,875
[ELMA]
Whoa!

306
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,208
Yep. Then, you push this.

307
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,500
[ELMA]
Apologies, human.

308
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,500
You do some pretty
difficult work.

309
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,708
But I've taken the time to
memorize Romanized character

310
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:02,291
input and that kind of nonsense,
so I won't fall behind anymore!

311
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,291
Hope not.

312
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,625
I do have a question.

313
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,250
when will I receive compensation
for today's labor?

314
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,500
Oh. That's, uh,
about a month from now.

315
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,416
Do you mean to tell me
I won't receive my pay tomorrow?

316
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,041
No. We total out at
the end of the month,

317
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,000
and today's the first,
so it'll be a while yet.

318
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,083
[ELMA gasps]

319
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,250
Then what do I do for
rent and food in the meantime?

320
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,083
Well, if you commute
from the other world,

321
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,166
I-- [gasps]

322
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,625
Let me guess,
you can't go back.

323
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,583
[ELMA gulps]

324
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,000
[KOBAYASHI]
Right...

325
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,750
I don't possess enough
power to open the gate

326
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,541
between worlds at
will like Tohru can.

327
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,000
[KOBAYASHI] I thought your power
was equal to Tohru's.

328
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,250
It is. I'm just as strong as
her, but in a different way.

329
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,500
Oh. [gasps] Wait here.

330
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,041
I know you've
got a lot on your plate,

331
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,333
but hang in there.

332
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,416
If you're gonna be
working with me,

333
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,333
I'll teach you as much as I can.

334
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,458
Don't want ya making
my life harder.

335
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,208
You have my gratitude.

336
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,916
That's pretty hot,
so be careful.

337
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,333
Later!

338
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,375
[ELMA sighs]

339
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,125
[gasps]
Yummy!

340
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,958
[KOBAYASHI] I probably
should keep quiet

341
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,583
about meeting Elma today.

342
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,000
Hey, guys. I'm home!

343
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,041
[TOHRU]
Welcome back!

344
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,333
Guess what we're
having for dinner--

345
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,166
[sniffs]

346
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,666
[gasps]
What're you doing?

347
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,625
[TOHRU]
There's a strange smell on you.

348
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,541
Is it a dog?

[TOHRU]
No, it's a dragon!

00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,375
Are you secretly cheating on me?

351
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,500
[KOBAYASHI] Whatever.
Look, so, today at work--

352
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,500
[TOHRU]
Wait, is it an office romance?!

353
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,416
Congrats. You've picked up
another weird phrase.

Miss Kobayashi!

[KOBAYASHI]
Huh?

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,916
[ELMA]
Thanks for your help today!

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,541
[KOBAYASHI]
You're doing great.

363
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,666
You've learned a lot
about PC operation, huh?

364
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,750
Impressive.

365
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,166
I'm all over this!

366
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,625
Yep. I'm gonna prove
myself to you.

367
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,500
[KOBAYASHI] Good, because you've
still got a ways to go.

368
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,333
[ELMA] Oh, Miss Kobayashi,
let's grab some sweet chestnuts

369
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,250
on the way home!
They're so yummy!

370
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Sure, whatever.

371
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,291
Why, you...

372
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,333
[KOBAYASHI] It's been a while
since my last day off.

373
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,000
Ugh, I wanna do nothing.

374

--Morning! Please excuse me!
--[KOBAYASHI screams]

375
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,291
I'll clean everything
so you can enjoy your day off

00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:39,666
in a clean room, Miss Kobayashi!
Does that sound good to you?

377
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,541
Yeah, I mean, I guess.

378
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,208
It's not that I'm
not grateful, but--

379
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,541
Hey! What are you doing?!

380

[TOHRU giggles]
What do you think?

382
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,333
When I get serious,
I can make a room spotless!

383
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,125
Except for the sparkling,
of course.

384
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,833
This room's never been so clean!

385
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,375

as if Shiva passed through!

in this spacious
and relaxing room!

I'm really hungry.

Yeah, I could eat, too.
Let's have breakfast, okay?

or an imperial feast!

Oh! Would you like
me to slaughter a cow?

402
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,666
I think I'd prefer
to have something light.

403

Yes! I understand!

to satisfy your lust,

and not your appetite?

what's wrong?

[KOBAYASHI] I can't. You're
spinning your wheels, though.

to how you were

What are you here for?

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,166
Well. You know I appreciate how
you're always helping me out,

431
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,666
so I decided to bring you
something to say thanks.

What's this?

I know that I can
be really selfish.

myself and put up with it.

pet my head a little bit...

I dunno. I've always found
them to be super confusing.

I have a tendency
to put distance

--Hey, Saikawa?
--[SAIKAWA] Hmm?

festival thing?

00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,833
Hold up.

Are you telling me you didn't
have them where you're from?

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,916
Oh, my gosh, a sports
festival is, like, one of

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,291
the most fun things ever.

10
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,333
There's running.

11
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,416
Running?

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,541

14
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:39,916

[SAIKAWA] Yeah, and lots
of other events where

teams up together!

18

Whoa!

20
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,083

with them and everything!

Whoa!

and be the hero of the day!

I mean, your mom's gonna be
beyond proud of you after this!

Gotta work that day. Can't.

28
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,833
[KANNA] Kobayashi...
Take the day off for me...

29
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,208
--Please...?
--Sorry, I can't do that.

30
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,666
Kanna, Miss Kobayashi's
in the middle of her death march

31
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,333
and on the verge of facing
Hades. Give it up already.

--No!
--[KOBAYASHI] Hmm?

00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,166
Also, what's a sports festival?

34
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,875
[KANNA] It's when you train
alongside your peers

35
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,833
to defeat strong opponents.

36
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,958
No, I think that's
a bit exaggerated.

37
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,250
[KANNA]
Defeat Hades fast, Kobayashi!

38
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,750
Then you can come watch me.

39
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,208
Don't be so selfish.

40
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,500
Besides, I'll come with you
to watch the sports.

41
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,708
[KANNA]
No...

42
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,875
Why's it gotta be
Miss Kobayashi, anyway?

43
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,000
What am I, chopped liver?

44
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,500
No, it's not you,
it's just that Saikawa said

45
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,041
our parents could come
with us for the day.

46
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:23,833
You're like my big sister.
Kobayashi's like a mom.

47
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,958
Reminder: I'm not
old enough to be Kanna's mom.

48
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,541
Although...

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,666
Some of my classmates
do have kids already.

50
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,125
Miss Kobayashi,
you hang in there!

51
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,875
[KOBAYASHI]
At any rate, I can't go.

52
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,083
Sorry, but you'll have to
make do with Tohru.

53
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,375
Great. "Make do."

54
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,583
Forget it!

55
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,875
Ah, Kanna!

56
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,041
I never thought
a parent showing up or not

57
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,583
was that big of a deal.

58
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,791
To start off with, it's not
like I'm Kanna's mother.

59
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,791
I'm just a random human she met.

60
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,375
I don't think that matters
to her much because

61
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,208
she's been treating you
like a mom-type figure for

62
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,291
a while now.

63
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,083
[sighs]
But why?

64
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,166
I can barely be around people.
How could I be a good mother?

65
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,666
This is stupid.

66
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,166
I never had both my parents
make it to sports festivals.

67
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,416
They were always
too busy working.

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,958
I never got upset, either.
I knew they had to support us.

69
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,041
Well, Kanna's parents
basically gave her free rein.

70
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,291
They felt a dragon would grow up
strong all on its own.

71
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,375
Since she bears
the name Kanna Kamui,

72
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,916
I'm sure they told her
she had to make sure

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,625
to be super strong.

74
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,625
But what she wanted
was her parents' attention,

75
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,416
which is why she pulled
all those silly pranks.

76
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,875
It just got her
banished to this world.

77
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,958
Makes sense she'd want you
to spoil her and give her

78
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,333
that attention, now.

79
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,708
I get what you're
saying, but I still just--

Hey, good morning, Kanna.
Something wrong?

82
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,625
Kobayashi won't come
to the sports festival.

83

Really? Wow. It's okay.

84

There's way more to
the day than just parents!

85
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,291
We get to work together
with the whole class to win,

86
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,041
and that's super fun.

of "work together"

a question of do you want to go,

00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,375
[TEACHER A] Thirty-second
in today's program,

353
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,791
the third graders' relay!

354
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,916
Hey, Kanna.

355
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,333
If we take first place here,
we'll win!

356
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,083
[KANNA]
Mm!

357
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,458
[TEACHER A]
This will be the final event

358
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,500
for the third graders.

359
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,750
Family and friends, they're
going to need your support

360
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,000
now more than ever!

361
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,750
[TEACHER B]
First female runners.

362
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,500
Take position!

363
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,875
[TEACHER B]
Ready...

364
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,041
[gunshot]

365
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,416
Go, Iida! Get it!

366
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,333
You can do it, Iida!

367
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,333
[TEACHER A] All the classes
have started strong.

368
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,375
Right now, Class 1
holds the lead.

369
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,666
Behind them are Class 2, 4,
and 3 bringing up the rear.

370
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,375
[TEACHER A] The baton's
passed to the second runner.

371
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,208
Makishima, keep up the pace!

372
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,375
Saikawa, you're gonna do great!

373
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,625
Well, yeah.

374
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,333
I'll be passing you the
baton from first place!

375
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,541
What a race!

376
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,750
Class 1 and 2 are currently
neck and neck!

377
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,708
Good job, ladies! Keep it up!

378
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,833
[SAIKAWA]
Hmm!

379
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,000
Here, I, go!

380
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,500
[TEACHER A] Wow,
Class 2 is closing in fast.

381
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,166
And now they've
passed Class 1!

382
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,916
[SAIKAWA panting]

383
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,458
[SAIKAWA gasps]
Ah!

384
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,333
[TEACHER A]
Oh, no! What a disappointment.

385
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,208
Class 2 dropped the baton!

386
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,333
[SAIKAWA whimpers]

387
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,250

[SAIKAWA pants]

389
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,375
[TEACHER A]
Class 1 is back in the lead.

390
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,208
Behind them are Class 4,
then 3, and last place is 2.

391
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,791
[SAIKAWA whimpers]

392
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,500
I'm sorry!

393
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,041
I got this!

394
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:42,750
[pants]

395
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,250
[TEACHER A] The anchors are
all fighting for the win,

396
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,083
but look at Class 2 go!

397
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,666
She's passing the others
with no problem.

398
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,916
[SAIKAWA gasps]

399
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,125
She's so fast.

400
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:02,875
[BOTH]
Just one more!

401
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,125
[BOTH]
You can do it!

402
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,625
[STUDENTS]
Kanna!

403
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,250
[gasps]

404
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,458
[TEACHER A]
Finish!

405
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,583
The winner: Class 2!

406
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,916

[BOYS chuckling]

409
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,833
[BOTH]
You're the best, Kanna!

410
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,041
[gasps]

411
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,625
[IIDA] I'm not kidding.
That was incredible!

412
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,208
[MAKISHIMA]
You were so cool!

413
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,208
[SAIKAWA gasps]
Kanna!

414
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,791
You licked me!

415
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,166
But, um... I'm sorry.

416
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,833
I messed up real bad...

417
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,541
No, you kept running.

418
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,750
If you'd given up,
there's no way

419
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,416
I could've passed all of them.

420
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,375
[SAIKAWA]
Huh...?

421
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,625
Thanks for being
such a good teammate.

422
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,750
[SAIKAWA squeals]

423
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,875
[SAIKAWA]
Oh, Kanna!

424
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,250
[SAIKAWA'S DAD sobs]

425
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,125
[KOBAYASHI]
Here you go. You were so good.

426
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,083
Thanks. I had a lot of fun.

427
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,291
You worked hard out there, too.

428
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,708
I know. Everyone
in our class worked hard,

429
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,541
that's why we were able to win.

430
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,500
I imagine it's less than
satisfying not being able

431
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,833
to go full out like
you normally do.

432
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,208
No, it was fine.

433
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,208
I like being with
the other kids.

434
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,041
Kobayashi.

435
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,375
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

436
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,416
Thank you so much for
coming today, really.

437
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,000
[KOBAYASHI gasps]

438
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,125
You are very welcome.

439
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,125
[KANNA] And thank you
for lunch, Lady Tohru.

440
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,250
No problem! Heh!
It was hardly anything.

441
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,625
[KOBAYASHI] Participating in a
sports festival as a guardian?

442
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,916
What in the world have I become?

443
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,416
[KOBAYASHI] And when did
this change even happen?

444
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,083
Although, I suppose
it would be rather nice

445
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,583
to let loose a little
bit more today.

446
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,750
I agree.

447
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,416
I'm so down. It's been too long.

448
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,666
Let's get to it, then.

449
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,625
Hey, I wanna play, too!

450
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,708
Oh, how fun!

451
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,916
All three of us together!

452
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That okay, Miss Kobayashi?

453
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,416
[sighs] Yeah, sure,
as long as you go where

454
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,208
you don't bother anyone.

455
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,875
[KANNA]
Lady Tohru, where should we go?

456
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,916
[TOHRU] Let's use the same place
we did last time.

457
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,916
--[LUCOA laughs]
--Oh, dragons.

458
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,375
[ELMA]
Which should I choose...?

459
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,208
Which should I choose?

460
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,416
Which should I choose?!

461
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,833
Which?!

462
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,250
[ELMA]
Why?!

463
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,166
Why must the stupid products
of man trouble me so?!

464
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,708
Humans are just...

465
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,916
...terrifying.

466
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,875
[GEORGIE] I'm the maid Georgie,
servant of the Saikawa family.

467
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,208
[LUCOA]
I'm Shouta's familiar.

468
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,708
You can just call me Lucoa.

469
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,541
--[GEORGIE] Familiar?
--[LUCOA] Yeah.

470
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,250
[GEORGIE] It seems we both have
somewhat unique hobbies, huh?

471
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,541
[LUCOA]
Yeah.

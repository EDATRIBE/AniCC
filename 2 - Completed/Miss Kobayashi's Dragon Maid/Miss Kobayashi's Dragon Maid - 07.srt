1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,375
Wow!

2
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,083
The beaches in
this world are pretty.

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,625
Real pretty!

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,416
With so many people, don't you
wanna just mow 'em all down

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,083
at once, Miss Kobayashi?

6
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,416
[KOBAYASHI]
Can't say I do.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,833
The ocean here's salty?

8
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,583
Yep, sure is.

9
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,083
That's the same, then.

10
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,791
[LUCOA] My favorite thing about
swimsuits is that you can

11
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,583
show off as much
flesh as you want!

12
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,458
[KOBAYASHI]
Not accurate or appropriate.

13
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,958
For real?

14
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,833
Shouta, baby, what do you think?

15
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,666
--[screams]
--[SHOUTA] So aggressive!

16
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,708
[sighs]
Way less scary.

17
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,958
Not a compliment,
but thanks for the effort, kid.

18
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,125
[STAFFER A]
Excuse me, ma'am.

19
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,666
--[KOBAYASHI] Hmm?
--Yeah?

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,500
I need you to come with me--
your swimsuit is way too skimpy.

21
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,666
Hey! Hold on!

22
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,375
[KOBAYASHI] Well, that
was entirely expected.

23
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,666
[sighs]
They finally let me back out!

24
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,791
Why did you think
to bring an extra suit?

25
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,416
I didn't. These're scales.

26
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,291
You guys wearing
scale suits, too?

27
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,041
They're cute.
I'll give you that.

28
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,041
[TOHRU] Thanks! We looked
up designs on the Internet.

29
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:36,958
Aren't you jealous?

30
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,166
[KOBAYASHI]
Of the suit? No.

31
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,916
Of what's filling it out? Yes.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,875
I wanna go play, please.

33
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,875
Looks like we're
gonna go play for a little bit.

34
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,125
What'll you do here
without us, though?

35
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,291
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm... Probably nothing.

36
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,166
What's the matter,
Miss Kobayashi?

37
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,541
You haven't seemed
excited all day.

38
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:53,875
There's a good reason for that.

39
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,791
To be honest, I'm not
a huge fan of the beach.

40
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,833
Huh?!

41
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,291
I think you might've
been too honest.

42
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,250
Whatever. It's hot, I burn,
and sand gets everywhere.

43
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,083
I couldn't agree more.
I prefer to be indoors, myself.

44
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,791
If that's true,
then why agree to come out

45
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,250
to a beach with us?

46
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,916
I have my reasons!

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,666
Primarily, I don't have a whole
lot going on this summer.

48
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,333
On top of that, my manager asked
me if I would look after Shouta.

49
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,083
I figured going along with
you guys was the path

50
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,500
of least resistance.

51
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,458
Wait, I get it. This is
a tsundere thing, am I right?

52
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,625
Not even a little.

53
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,458
I wanna go play now, please.

54
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,500
Oh, right, gotcha. Just a sec.

55
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,375
Uhh...

56
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,166
[screams]
Sunscreen! First things first!

57
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,166
"I'm an inferior human
'cause my skin gets damaged

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,375
by the sun without this stuff!"

59
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,250
Okay, let me start with you,
Miss Kobayashi!

60
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,416
Get weird and get fired.

61
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,250
[gasps]

62
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,458
Here you go, Shouta, baby.
You don't mind, do you?

63
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,083
Perfect. Have at it!

64
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,416
[whimpers]

65
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,375
C'mon.

66
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,791
[whimpers]

67
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,208
[SHOUTA]
No, I can't!

68
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,583
Boo. Then let's switch!

69
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,875
[laughs]

70
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,541
[SHOUTA gasps]

71
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,083
All right. Is that good?

72
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,375
What? Is what good?! [whimpers]

73
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,041
[LUCOA]
Am I coating you good?

74
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,958
[SHOUTA growls]
I knew it. You are a demon!

75
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,583
Why...?

76
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:19,041
[SHOUTA] Bad demon, bad!
Stop trying to seduce me!

77
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,375
Lucoa, um...

78
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,291
At this point, you might
as well start acting like

79
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,333
you're a demon.

80
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,041
I want to play now, please.

81
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,708
How about watermelon splitting?

82
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:27,750
[KANNA]
I'm in.

83
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,541
[TOHRU]
Go a little farther right!

84
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,375
[LUCOA] No, too far,
too far. Go back left.

85
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,625
[TOHRU] Go straight.
That's right. Okay, stop.

86
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:39,458
[KANNA grunts]

87
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,916
[GROUP yells]

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,791
--Yay.
--Good job, Kanna!

89
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,291
You obliterated
every last trace of it.

90
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,250
Well. Whaddaya gonna do?

91
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,833
[KANNA]
I wanna swim, now!

92
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,875
Heck yeah. I wanna swim, too!

93
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey, be sure
that you don't go too far out.

94
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,625
What? How come?

95
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,333
[KOBAYASHI]
It's dangerous.

96
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,208
Yeah. I guess you're
right about that, so okay.

97
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,666
Not too far.

98
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,583
I still remember that time
Leviathan almost killed me,

99
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,000
and I don't want that.

100
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,125
What did you do?

101
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,791
I was too far away
to see him clearly,

102
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,458
so I accidentally
called him Rahab.

103
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,000
[LEVIATHAN]
Why, you...!

104
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,791
My point was less
dragon rage and more,

105
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,000
"don't drown."

106
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,833
Oh, yeah, I totally
forgot humans don't have

107
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,666
the ability to
breathe under water.

108
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,291
Stupid and inferior.

109
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,750
[KOBAYASHI]
You can breathe under water?

110
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,333
Well, of course!

111
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,916
There's nothing like swimming to
your heart's content, you know?

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,875
[KOBAYASHI]
What, does she have gills now?

113
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,833
Lady Tohru,
let's race to the area there.

114
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,833
Sure, I think that's reasonable.

115
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,125
Do you mind giving us the
signal, Miss Kobayashi?

116
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,375
[KOBAYASHI]
Okay. On your marks, get set.

117
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,875
Go!

118
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:43,250
[gasps] I forgot to remind
them to hold back.

119
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,000
[TOHRU]
Not too bad, Kanna.

120
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,666
[KANNA]
Impressive, Lady Tohru.

121
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,041
[TOHRU]
I win!

122
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,458
That was too far!

123
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,958
[BOTH]
We know. We're sorry.

124
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:59,833
[sighs] Well, it's whatever.
Are you ready for lunch?

125
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,291
[BOTH gasp]
Yeah!

126
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,750
[GROUP]
Thank you. It was delicious!

127
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,333
[KANNA]
What's next, Lady Tohru?

128
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,125
[TOHRU]
I dunno.

129
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,833
Miss Kobayashi,
what do you--

130
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,250
What's wrong, Miss Kobayashi?

131
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,916
Oh. Nothing.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,833
Just realized that old man
hasn't changed much

133
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,458
since the last time I saw him.

134
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,666
[TOHRU]
When was that?

135
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,041
[KOBAYASHI]
Back when I was a little kid.

136
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,375
I used to come to this beach
with my family a lot.

137
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,708
[TOHRU]
Family...

138
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,375
[TOHRU'S FATHER]
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

139
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,208
[KOBAYASHI]
You okay?

140
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,541
[gasps]

141
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,041
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

142
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,500
[TOHRU]
I'm fine.

143
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,083
[TOHRU]
Miss Kobayashi?

144
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,333
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

145
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,833
Could you please tell me
more about your family?

146
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,250
I mean, that is if you
don't mind telling me.

147
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,875
Huh?

148
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,083
I'd appreciate it.

149
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,750
Yeah, okay, sure.

150
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,208
I think we were
a normal family.

151
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,875
Y'know, for the most part.

152
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,708
I felt like I was raised
normally, at least.

153
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,208
They got me through
college, so I can't complain.

154
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,583
After that, though,
I left home to go to work.

155
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,083
I call my parents every now
and then to catch up.

156
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,625
Tell 'em how I'm doing,
stuff like that.

157
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:17,833
I, uh, I haven't seen
them in a while now, though.

158
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,333
And is that
considered normal for

159
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,375
a human family in this world?

160
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,958
I guess.

161
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,666
[TOHRU]
Normal, huh?

162
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,916
Then, why would she welcome
a dragon into her home?

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,750
And if she's from
a normal family,

164
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,208
why aren't most humans as
accepting as Miss Kobayashi?

165
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,875
I don't get it.

166
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,541
Maybe I'm wrong.

167
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:40,666
Maybe humans of this world
actually could accept dragons.

168
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,750
[TOHRU'S FATHER]
Kill them! Humans are evil!

169
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,833
Kill them all!

170
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,750
[KOBAYASHI]
You sure you're okay?

171
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,250
[TOHRU gasps]

172
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,916
Yeah. Don't worry.

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm fine!
I just, I feel listless today.

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,958
I'm not used
to having low energy.

175
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:06,583
[KOBAYASHI]
Tohru.

176
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,500
[TOHRU]
Uh?

177
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,541
Can I ride you?

178
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,000
[TOHRU gasps]

179
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,416
[GROUP yells]

180
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:22,833
[gasping, yelling]

181
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,916
[KOBAYASHI]
This is incredible!

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,291
[TOHRU] I'm glad you're
having fun! I am, too!

183
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,625
[KOBAYASHI]
All right.

184
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,958
Tohru.

185
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,250
Do you think you're
starting to get homesick?

186
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,333
[TOHRU]
No, not particularly.

187
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,208
Well, that makes
one of us, then.

188
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,416
Thanks to our discussion,

189
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,666
I feel like I need to
go visit my parents.

190
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,208
[TOHRU] I'd like to see my
parents every now and then.

191
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,291
But it's no big deal.

192
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:01,041
No? Then what's
really bugging you?

193
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,000
[TOHRU] I thought for a
second about introducing you

194
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,500
to my parents.

195
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,125
You can do that if you want.

196
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,416
[TOHRU]
No, I can't.

197
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,291
Why not?

198
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,416
[TOHRU] Because I'm
pretty sure they'd kill you.

199
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,958
Does seem excessive,
but, that's most likely

200
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,208
just common sense in
your world, huh?

201
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,750
[TOHRU]
For sure.

202
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,125
From my parents' point of view,
I'm about as far from normal

203
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,583
as you can get.

204
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,958
They don't think I have any
common sense to speak of.

205
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,958
It's makes me sad.

206
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,250
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm...

207
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,958
[KOBAYASHI] Talking to Tohru
about this kind of stuff

208
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,041
is intense. And yeah.
That makes me sad, too.

209
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,416
[KOBAYASHI] Certainly drives
home the difference between

210
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,083
understanding words and
understanding each other.

211
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,166
I've never really considered
how completely different

212
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,083
our worlds are.

213
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,500
Although, I bet that's
why I always feel like

214
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,875
I need to cherish the time we
get to spend together so much.

215
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,041
You know what?

216
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,625
That sounds an awful lot like
independence to me.

217
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,166
[TOHRU]
Independence?

218
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,708
Yep. You've developed your own
unique set of values, Tohru.

219
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,916
[TOHRU] So then, you mean
I've become an adult?

220
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,458
[KOBAYASHI] Who knows?
I'm not even sure about me.

221
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,125
Most people don't try to become
adults, they just reach a point

222
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,291
where they realize they can't
stay children any longer.

223
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,833
[TOHRU] Ooh, that's deep,
Miss Kobayashi!

224
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,958
Got one!

225
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,041
[KOBAYASHI]
Tiny...

226
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,375
[TOHRU chuckles]

227
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,583
[KOBAYASHI]
Ready to head back?

228
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,875
[TOHRU]
Sure!

229
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,583
[TOHRU, KANNA]
Dragon fireworks?

230
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,833
That's right.

231
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,666
Won 'em in a lottery at
the shopping district.

232
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,083
[BOTH gasp]

233
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,333
[KANNA]
That's it?

234
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,833
[KOBAYASHI]
Yep.

235
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,875
[TOHRU gasps] A real dragon is
way cooler than that crap!

236
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,875
[inhales]

237
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,625
[KANNA gasps]
Very impressive, Lady Tohru.

238
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,875
[TOHRU (muffled)]
See! See!

239
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,958
How's that, Miss Kobayashi,
how's that?!

240
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,333
What?

241
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,958
I can't understand anything
you're saying right now.

242
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,541
[gasps]
What on Earth is that?

243
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,250
[KOBAYASHI]
The admission line for Comiket.

244
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,916
And the reason we're
around all these people

245
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,083
is to provide cover
for Mister Takiya?

246
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,250
Not cover. We just came to help.

247
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,708
Apparently, his other
two assistants collapsed.

248
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,250
Ooh, I'm all over this!

249
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,375
With my power, I'll be able to
exterminate them in no time!

250
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,875
Do not.

251
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,791
[TOHRU] By the way, was leaving
Kanna behind a good idea?

252
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:07,916
[KOBAYASHI]
There's a lot of stuff here

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,458
children shouldn't see.

254
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,750
Thanks, guys! You're saving me!
I'm screwed without help.

255
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,416
It's cool. I kinda
owe you a few anyway.

256
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,833
I would have thought
you'd ask Fafnir

257
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,208
to help you out with this.

258
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,375
Uh, he's
participating as a circle.

259
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,416
Huh?!

260
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,125
What? He's a circle?

261
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,208
Sorta?

262
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,916
A circle's a group
of people like us.

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,791
We sell the art we
make to other fans.

264
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,750
It's way fun.

265
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,083
That makes sense.

266
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,833
But why would Fafnir ever
do anything like that?

267
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,500
[TAKIYA] I recommended all kinds
of anime and games to him.

268
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,958
At some point he
started drawing his own.

269
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,541
[TOHRU] He really seems
to be getting into this world.

270
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,500
Kobayashi, you can handle sales.

271
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,541
Tohru, I'd really appreciate it
if you could deal with the line.

272
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,291
Sure thing.

273
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,125
[TOHRU]
Hmph. All right. Fine.

274
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,541
[VOICE A] Attention, Ladies and
Gentlemen, as of this moment,

275
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,625
the third day of Comic Market
has officially begun!

276
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,666
Guys? What's going on?

277
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,125
[STAFFER B]
No running in the hall, please.

278
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,083
[gasps]

279
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,833
[STAFFER B]
Please do not run.

280
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,208
[TOHRU]
This is bizarre.

281
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,791
It's like they can all barely
contain themselves!

282
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,083
Something powerful is holding
back their selfish desires.

283
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,125
What in the world?

284
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,125
[GUY A]
The new one, please.

285
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,375
[KOBAYASHI]
Cash or charge?

286
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,166
Cash! Thank you very much.

287
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,291
[GUY B] The new and
the previous one, please.

288
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,083
[TOHRU] The end of the line
for <i>Water Dragon Shrine</i>

289
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,500
starts right here!

290
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:35,333
Up there, could you guys
group closer together, please?

291
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,916
[sighs]

292
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,791
[TOHRU] Hard to believe tens
of thousands of individuals

293
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,750
are able to take such
unified actions without

294
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,541
any prior exercises or training.

295
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,541
An extremely powerful
energy must be at work.

296
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,083
[PHOTOGRAPHER A]
Uh, excuse me.

297
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,166
Who, me?

298
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, are you,
by chance, a cosplayer?

299
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,541
No, by choice, I'm not.

300
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,458
Right, gotcha. I'm sorry.
Well, you look awesome.

301
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,708
I figured you were from
abroad or something.

302
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,041
I happen to be a
real maid wearing a uniform.

303
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,708
Uh. Oh, I get it now.
You're just in character.

304
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:06,833
How fun!

305
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,875
You're wrong. I'm the real deal.

306
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,208
Hey, I understand. It's policy.

307
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,708
If you don't mind,
I promise to come by

308
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,083
and take your
picture later, okay?

309
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,125
No, wait! I told you
that I'm real!

310
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,583
The end of the line for

These people are passionate.

313
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,791
Meanwhile, I'm over
here feeling like

314
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,458
I'm in a firedrake's stomach.

Thank you, sir. Have a good one!

316
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,625
[TOHRU] I can't believe
it's this insane.

317
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,500
Comiket is not
to be underestimated.

318
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,958
Still, though...

319
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,041
What in the world could be
attracting this many people

320
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,875
and keeping them all in check?

321
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,750
It's beyond me...
and kinda terrifying.

[TOHRU]
Let's see...

334
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,083
We should be getting close.

335
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,250
What are you looking for?

336
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,875
Trying to find Fafnir.

337
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,166
I figured I should stop by and
say hi while I'm on my break.

338
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,250
If you say anything,
I'll kill you.

339
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,916
Don't be fussy. Besides,
you're the one who looks dead.

340
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,333
It's no fun, but this is what

341
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,000
it's like for first-timers.

342
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,958
Mind if I, um,
look at your book?

You-- Fafnir!

346
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,500
You've printed real,
effective curses!

347
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,916
You even tell how
to inflict them!

348
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,666
You could curse someone
to death if you read this aloud!

349
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,708
You what?

350
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,875
[TOHRU]
That's all you're charging?!

351
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,541
Wow, talk about a bargain.

352
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,541
So, uh, maybe...
you shouldn't be

353
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,916
selling that to people.

354
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,041
There are so many
cosplayers here.

355
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,666
I think that's my favorite part.
It's fun to watch.

356
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,750
You'd be surprised
how many races from my world

357
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,958
are represented by these humans.

358
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,541
[KOBAYASHI] For them,
it's more about pretending to be

359
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,958
characters from anime and manga.

360
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,333
If you wanted to,
you could totally do that.

361
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,166
I am a proper maid, thank you!

362
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,000
No matter how you dress me up,
I will always be

363
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,416
your loyal sex slave.

364
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,333
Uh... That's not proper or maid.

365
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,416
[gasps]

366
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,125
[KOBAYASHI]
What's up?

367
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,125
There's a goblin, a witch,
and a sahuagin over there.

368
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,166
[KOBAYASHI]
Wonder what they're from.

369
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,458
Nothing. They're real.

370
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,958
Huh?

371
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,250
They're not dressed up in
costumes, and they're not human.

372
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,375
Huh?!

373
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,791
Excuse me? Yes, hello.

374
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,208
I just had a real quick question
for the three of you.

375
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,583
Oh, hi. Can I assume
you're like us?

376
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,500
Yes. I was wondering
what you're doing here?

377
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,125
I like to come to these
to spread my wings.

378
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,375
[GOBLIN]
Same here.

379
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,708
I normally live my life
disguised as a human.

380
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,500
But being able to come
to events like this gives me

381
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,625
a chance to enjoy
my real form.

382
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,041
I see that.

383
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,791
Why not take a chance
and join us, dear?

384
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,166
You can let your real form be
seen while also being safe!

385
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,125
No. That'd be impossible.

386
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,541
I mean, I'm a dragon.

387
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,041
[GROUP gasps]

388
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,041
Dragon?!

389
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:17,875
Yes?

390
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,291
You're a real damn monster?

391
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,541
I guess?

392
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,750
And you... You could eat
us all if you wanted?

393
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,000
Huh?

394
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,083
--[MONSTERS] Run!
--[STAFFER B] No running!

395
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,625
[KOBAYASHI] Dragons must
do some crazy stuff.

396
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,958
[TOHRU]
Don't believe them...

397
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:30,708
Huh?

398
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:31,958
When dragons get hungry,

399
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,333
we only eat as much as
necessary to survive.

400
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,750
And this world is survival of
the fittest anyway!

401
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,333
So you're not denying anything,
just explaining it?

402
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,916
[STAFFER A] Hey, you!
Could you come with me, please?

403
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,625
You're costume's too skimpy.

404
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,625
Did you not read the
participant's guide?

405
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,500
[TOHRU] I didn't expect
Lucoa to show up.

406
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,625
[LUCOA]
Hey...

407
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,666
[KOBAYASHI]
Skimpy is as skimpy does.

408
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,833
Now that I look closer,

409
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,208
there's more than
I first thought.

410
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,083
Beings in their
true form, I mean.

411
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,250
Are there a lot?

412
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,791
Yes.

413
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,875
Those that've had a greater
presence while they were here

414
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,000
have left records of
their stays in this world

415
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,333
on several different
levels for tourists.

416
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,458
Like Fafnir and Lucoa.
I'm sure you've heard of some.

417
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,416
I, umm... I think--

418
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,583
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

419
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:31,208
I think, that...
I wanna be in my real form.

420
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,666
At least partly, just for a bit.

421
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,000
Please...?

422
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,375
As long as you can
do it and stay out of trouble.

423
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,000
It's fine with me.

424
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,291
[gasps]

425
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,250
[TOHRU]
Sorry that took so long!

426
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,125
[gasps] Can I take your
picture like that?

427
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,166
[TOHRU giggles]
Yes!

428
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,291
Excuse me!
Can I take one, too?

429
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,250
[PHOTOGRAPHER C]
Hey, me, too!

430
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,333
[TOHRU]
Uh?

431
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,958
[PHOTOGRAPHER D] Over here!
Can you look this way please?

432
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,291
[PHOTOGRAPHER E]
Look over here, next, please!

433
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,875
[KOBAYASHI]
Crap, our break's almost over.

434
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,375
[PHOTOGRAPHER F] Stay there and
just move your head this way!

435
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh, well.

436
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,875
[sighs]

437
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,375
See? Told ya! I came for
your pic like I promised!

438
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,625
Right. Hello. How's it going?

439
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,916
Uh, to be honest,

440
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,041
it's been going
pretty rough for me.

441
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,375
But I'm hanging in there!

442
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,208
Hey, so.

443
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,541
From my perspective, it seems
like everyone in this place

444
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,208
has been drawn here by
something with a lot of power.

445
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,291
Do you have any idea
what that something might be?

446
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,750
Uh...

447
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,083
I'm not sure, but uh...
Well, it's for sure special.

448
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,166
And it's only right here
in this moment.

449
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,666
Might as well make
the most of it.

450
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,750
[gasps]

451
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,833
Whatever this is, it's making
a lot of people happy.

452
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,041
[TOHRU]
Hmm?

453
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,041
Yes, you're right.

454
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,541
Might as well
make the most of it.

455
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,583
[PHOTOGRAPHER G]
Hey, buddy.

456
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,208
Will you take
the picture already?

457
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,500
[PHOTOGRAPHER A]
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

458
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,500
Uh-oh! Geh!

459
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,541
Don't tell me there's
another line forming?

460
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,958
[VOICE A]
As of right now,

461
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,958
Comic Market 90
is officially over.

462
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,708
Thank you everyone
for your participation.

463
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,458
We hope to see you
all again in the winter

464
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:32,000
for the next epic Comiket!
Thank you again!

465
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,541
[TOHRU pants]
I'm back. [sighs]

466
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,083
You survived!

467
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,166
And don't worry, we managed
fine without you after lunch.

468
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,333
I'm so sorry.

469
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,500
I honestly never
intended to ditch you.

470
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,166
I know, it's fine.

471
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,166
Oh, hey, Fafnir,
how'd your book sell?

472
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,250
[FAFNIR growls]

473
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,000
Apparently, not all that well.

474
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,458
All right, so what did you think
of your first ever Comiket?

475
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,375
[TOHRU]
Hmm? Well, let's see...

476
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,125
Mainly, it just reconfirmed
my love for you,

477
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,208
Miss Kobayashi.

478
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,291
Huh?

479
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,791
[TOHRU giggles]

480
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,333
Thank you, ladies!

481
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,708
You were a huge help today.
Like, the best assistants ever!

482
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:15,791
And if it's no trouble,

483
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,250
I'd love your help
again this winter!

484
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,041
[screams]
Hell no, I'm done with this!

485
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:20,791
[TAKIYA]
Huh...?

486
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,791
[laughs]

487
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,583
What do you think we should
print for our next thin book?

488
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,875
[GOBLIN]
How about a dragon maid girl?

489
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,166
That sounds great!

490
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,666
So they gave you "free studies"?

491
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,666
[KANNA]
Mm-hmm. It's my summer homework.

492
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,333
What do you think I should do?

493
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,833
Well, if I were you.

494
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,333
I would probably choose
something mysterious.

495
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,041
Something that I'd like
to know more about

496
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,625
so I didn't get bored with it.

497
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,625
[KANNA]
Okay. That makes sense.

498
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,666
Whatcha doing, Kanna?

499
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,666
Studying you. Act natural.

500
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,416
Huh? [groans]

501
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,125
[TAKIYA] You know, Kobayashi,
there's a lot of talk

502
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,791
about Tohru on the Internet.

503
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:37,708
[KOBAYASHI]
Yeah, I bet.

504
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,083
[TAKIYA]
They mentioned you, too.

505
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,250
They said there was a sales lady
with dead-fish eyes.

506
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,500
[KOBAYASHI]
Sorry 'bout that.

507
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,791
[TAKIYA] And they got
turned on by those eyes.

508
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,083
[KOBAYASHI]
And now I'm creeped out.

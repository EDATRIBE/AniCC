179
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,750

Roar!

00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,416
--[LUCOA] Roar!
--[SHOUTA] Out with bad demon,

00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,750

Growl, growl, roar!

00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,208

--Lucoa!
--Huh?

185
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,083
--[CAT A meows]
--What's wrong?

186
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,833
Was Shouta-baby
worried about me?

187
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,541
No, he wasn't!
Shut up!

188
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,083
[LUCOA]
Awwwww.

189
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:24,125
[KOBAYASHI]
Ugh, I'm so exhausted.

190
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,916
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh. That's right.

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,291
Tonight's dinner is <i>omurice</i> .

192
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,416
That was the first normal
meal Tohru cooked me,

193
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,125
now that I think about it.

194
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,875
Dinner's ready, Miss Kobayashi.

195
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,750
[KOBAYASHI] She presented it
to me with such confidence.

196
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,875
And it was pretty good, too.

197
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,666
Before that, everything
she made was so weird.

198
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,791
Either way, it's been nice.

199
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,125
I honestly can't remember the
last time someone was willing

200
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:55,041
to cook for me at all, much less
with that level of excitement.

201
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:59,208
I remember telling her
the <i>omurice</i> was just okay.

202
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,291
Today, I won't.

203
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,541
I'll tell her...
that it's good.

204
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,916
[WORKER A]
Hey, hurry up and get it to me!

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,791
[WORKER B] Forget about that,
you need to fix this error!

206
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,375
Kobayashi!
It's almost deadline time!

207
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,375
[KOBAYASHI]
I know!

208
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,416
Kobayashi! Error alert!

209
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,583
[KOBAYASHI]
Fixing them now, sir.

210
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,375
Kobayashi! Help over here.

211
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,250
[KOBAYASHI]
On my way, sir!

212
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,833
Kobayashi! Kobayashi! Kobayashi!

213
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,041
Shut up!

214
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,250
Gimme another one!

215
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,250
Coming up.

216
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,875
[laughing]

217
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,375
There goes my stop!

218
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,333
I don't know where I'm going to!
[laughing]

219
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,750
The mountain sounds good.
Air's clear here.

220
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,458
[KOBAYASHI shouting]
What? Bears! Bring it on!

221
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,958
Tasty beary bears!

222
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,583
[laughing]

223
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:55,541
Oh man! It's pitch dark
black! Can't see!

224
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,125
[KOBAYASHI]
Ow.

225
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,958
[TOHRU growls]

226
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,333
[KOBAYASHI groans]

227
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,916
You shall not pass!

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,166
[hiccups]

229
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,708
Huh?

230
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:12,333
[TOHRU] Human. Out of
what hole dids't thou crawl?

231
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,500
[KOBAYASHI]
Huh...?

232
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:25,625
Whoa! A dragon, ooh, hug me!

233
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,583
Ow!

234
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,458
[TOHRU]
Depart, insolent human!

235
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,208
Otherwise, I shall eat you!

236
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:39,458
[TOHRU] Alas. I am
going to die, as well.

237
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,625
How tragic it is
the last being I meet

238
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,291
is a pathetic human.

239
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,041
Hey, do you ever get bored
listening to yourself talk?

240
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,416
Is froufrou lingo
like, your thing?

241
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,541
[TOHRU]
How dare you?

242
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,083
You want me to pull that out?

243
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,791
[TOHRU]
Huh? Well...

244
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,250
[KOBAYASHI hiccups]

245
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,583
[TOHRU]
No! You fool!

246
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:03,166
If a mere human touches God's
sword, their mind shall be torn.

247
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,875
[KOBAYASHI]
I dunno about all that.

248
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,708
But if God exists, then...

249
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,666
...he should exteeeend...

250
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,458
--[TOHRU] No. No, no, no.
--...my stupid deadline...

251
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,666
--...right now!

252
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,458
[KOBAYASHI]
Aaah!

253
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,458
I know this is
just my dream, but...

254
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,291
...why does a dragon gotta be
such a big, jerk-baby?!

255
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,583
[TOHRU] Apologies.
You saved me regardless,

256
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,458
and it is appreciated.

257
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,375
I was defeated in battle
with the gods,

258
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,000
and barely escaped
to this world.

259
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,541
I imagine you only managed
to remove that sword

260
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,125
because you lack faith.
I am truly grateful.

261
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,375
Don't judge
on prejudices- yours!

262
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,416
Boop, boop, boop.

263
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,833
Wanna drink?
Sure you do!

264
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:47,958
Drink with me, dragon!

265
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,291
Drink with me,
and listen to my story!

266
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,208
[sobbing]
Why won't you drink?

270
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,375
[KOBAYASHI]
So you're a lady dragon, then?

271
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,166
Yes. I am female.

272
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,666
To be honest, I detest
using this spell, but...

273
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Ooh! You're down to drank!

274
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,833
Yay! Just us girls, let's go!

275
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,125
[TOHRU]
You're a girl?

276
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,250
Yes, Rude Dragon!

277
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,791
[TOHRU]
I'm sorry.

278
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,000
[KOBAYASHI] You're gonna have
to let me fondle your tits.

279
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,541
It's okay to be curious
even though society

280
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,750
pressures me to say I'm not!

281
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,750
--[TOHRU] Okay.
--[KOBAYASHI] I can?

282
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,291
For real!
I work hard and for what?

283
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,750
I'm telling ya, this whole
world is unfair, man!

284
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,625
Yeah, keep preaching sister!

285
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,000
Let me bring an end
to this place for you!

286
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,250
And what the hell?

287
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,916
Your subordinate, your problem!

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,208
[screams]

289
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,208
Do not assume all dragons
are really lolicons

290
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,708
who randomly demand
villages' virgin daughters!

291
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,750
Gaahhh!

292
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,166

[BOTH laughing]

295
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,458
Nights like this are when
I wonder why I'm all alone.

296
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,250
[hiccups]

297
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,000
Me, too.

298
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,875
But I truly am alone here.
There's no one.

299
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,583
Just me.

300
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,250
[KOBAYASHI]
Do you have anywhere to go?

301
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,625
[TOHRU]
No.

302
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:32,166
But to be fair, I have been
alone from the start.

303
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,125
Huh. So, wanna stay
with me, dragon?

304
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:46,958
[TOHRU sobbing]

305
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,458
Yes, I do!

306
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,166
You can be my maid!

307
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,708
Your what?

308
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,416
Listen! We're not talking about
just a simple servant here!

309
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,708
Seriously, you can have
house maids, laundry maids,

310
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,166
all kinds of maids.

311
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,333
And it takes major training--

312
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,833
it's not all those posers
at maid cafés!

313
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,041
--[KOBAYASHI] Oh.
--[TOHRU] Eh?

00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,875
My name's Kobayashi.

My name's Tohru.

316
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,041
Hello, Tohru!

317
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,750
Look, I don't mean
to shade maid cafés,

318
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,041
they're fine for what they are,
but they help contribute

319
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,875
to the maid profession
being taken lightly.

320

Oborozuka. Oborozuka.

321
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,500
[KOBAYASHI]
Crazy.

322
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,416
I feel like I dreamt about
something important.

323
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,500
--[KOBAYASHI] I'm home.
--[KANNA] Kobayashi!

Yay! Welcome back home!

325
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,208
We just finished the <i>omurice</i> !

[KANNA]
I helped make it!

00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,041
Oh!

328
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,958
It's gonna be great!

329
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,041
[KOBAYASHI]
The <i>omurice</i> was delicious.

330
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,708
But I was so busy pointing out
all the obvious issues.

331
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,541
I sorta forgot to tell her
how good it was.

Thanks for coming
out of nowhere, rain!

I'm back!

they said, "No chance of rain."

Takiya, help me.

00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,750
It's guerrilla warfare.

339
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,125
Time to ambush.

340
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,958
[TAKIYA]
Yeah, sure.

[TOHRU]
Hmm.

342
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,458
I guess we'll be having this
for lunch for a while.

Is it okay if I pet him?

344
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:37,916

Come on. You're squishing us!

348
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,000
What simple pets, giving such
affection to their humans.

349
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,791
Yeah, you're one to talk.

350
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,166
--Kanna.
--No.

351
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,250
[TOHRU]
Groans.

352
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,500
Speaking of the
nearness of me,

353
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,958
were there any humans
in your old world

354
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,625
you were particularly close to?

355
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,666
Humans in my world?
I guess so, kinda.

356
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,666
There is one human
I can think of.

357
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,416
You could say
I associated with them,

358
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,208
if only for a little while.

359
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,166
Really? What were they like?

360
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,208
[TOHRU]
Heh. If you'll excuse me.

361
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,250
I'm going to have to talk
a lot about myself now.

362
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,416
[TOHRU] I first met that
human in a deserted village

363
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,208
that was in ruins.

364
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,375
[TOHRU] This should work
as my home for a while.

365
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,750
[TOHRU]
Uh!

366
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,750
It's rare to encounter
a dragon in a place like this!

367
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,083
I'm actually only here
to hide out, myself.

368
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,500
Do you mind if I
stay a short time?

369
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,125
[TOHRU]
You're a bandit?

370
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,000
Yes, that's right.
I mistook a noble

371
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,000
for a merchant
and attacked their party.

372
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,625
Now, I'm on the run!

373
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,750
My comrades have been captured,
leaving me alone.

374
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,666
So I'm currently
debating my options

375
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,458
on where I should go next.

376
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,375
[TOHRU]
Do you believe I care?

377
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,458
I could save you time
and kill you.

378
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,416
[HUMAN A laughing]

379
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,708
[TOHRU]
How dare you laugh at me!

380
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,333
Oh, I'm sorry!

381
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,625
I mean no offense, Dragon,
but you're not very used to

382
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,375
threatening people, are you?

383
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,750
[TOHRU]
Excuse me?

384
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,125
It's just not
very convincing, sorry!

385
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,291
[TOHRU]
'Tis not just a threat, human!

386
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,125
See what I mean?

387
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,458
[TOHRU growls]

388
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,291
[HUMAN A]
So. It's okay, then?

389
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,083
You'll let me stay for a while?

390
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,000
Eeeh!

391
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,916
--[TOHRU] Do as you please.
--[HUMAN A] Thank you!

392
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,250
[TOHRU]
Thinking back on it now,

393
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,750
I could've just left
and found somewhere else.

394
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,083
But in that moment...
I guess...

395
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,791
I couldn't allow myself
to yield to a human.

396
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,041
[HUMAN A] Hey, so...
you're a dragon, right?

397
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,833
What's that kind of life like?

398
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,916
[TOHRU]
What do you mean?

399
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,708
You know, like how you can fly.

400
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,958
And you possess so much power

401
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,875
you'll pretty much
never lose a fight.

402
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,625
I wish I knew what it
was like to live so freely.

403
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,250
Must be wondrous.

404
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,458
Uh! Hey! I'm talking!

405
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,666
[TOHRU] At the time,
I found myself thinking.

406
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,750
What was my freedom like?

407
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,708
I had never thought of myself
as "free" before then.

408
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,625
I was born with
the chaos faction.

409
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:10,166
I lived with chaos,
and I fought the divine.

410
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,791
If that all ended,
would I be free?

411
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,000
Would it ever end?

412
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,833
Even if it did end, and I was
free, what would I do?

413
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,750
[TOHRU] What would you do
if you had my freedom?

414
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,583
[HUMAN A]
Hmm? I'd be a maid!

415
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,208
--[TOHRU] A maid?
--Yes! A maid.

416
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,250
I'd wear the cutest maid outfit.

417
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,333
I'd greet every single guest
with my very best smile,

418
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,208
and I would totally
fall in love with my master.

419
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,375
[TOHRU] You would willingly
enslave yourself?

420
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,083
[HUMAN A] Yep! But
that's kinda the point!

421
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,041
I'd get to have a choice!

422
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,500
Mine!

423
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,291
Had I chosen it, my life would
be so different, y'know?

424
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,083
Even now, if I could
make my own decision

425
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,708
between the two options.

426
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,458
At least I could
choose to stay a bandit

427
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,416
or choose to be a slave.

428
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,958
[TOHRU]
I see.

429
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,625
[HUMAN A]
Right?

430
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,375
[TOHRU]
I realized that I had never made

431
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,458
my own choice, either.

432
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,541
But I hadn't been as
bothered by it as she was.

433
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,583
[TOHRU] Since there wasn't
anyone else I wanted to see,

434
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:12,000
I allowed the girl to stay and
chatted with her for a while.

435
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,791
[HUMAN A]
I'm probably good to go.

436
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,208
[TOHRU]
You are leaving?

437
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,916
[HUMAN A] Mhmm. I think
I'll cross over the mountains

438
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,791
and see if I can get into
a nation bordering this one.

439
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,916
I'm sure something'll
work out for me.

440
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,291
Oh, do you mind?
Can I ride you real quick?

441
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,291
[TOHRU]
Of course not!

442
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,958
I shall never let
a human ride me!

443
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,541
Selfish! Selfish!

444
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,166
[TOHRU] Say what you will.
I would die first!

445
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,000
[laughing]
I hope to see you again.

446
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,333
Goodbye, Dragon!
And thank you.

447
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,791
[TOHRU]
For what?

448
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,541
[HUMAN A]
For spending time with me.

449
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,583
[TOHRU]
She left after that.

450
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,541
The annoying human
was finally gone.

451
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,083
At least, that's how
I should have felt.

452
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,625
But instead,
I felt a little sad.

453
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,375
I'm sure.
Do you think that person

454
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,583
might have something to do with

455
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,500
why you decided
to become my maid?

456
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,000
[TOHRU]
Probably.

457
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,166
I don't say this sort
of thing often, but

458
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,958
I don't think I'd mind
seeing that human again.

459
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,125
[KOBAYASHI]
I get that.

460
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,708
[TOHRU]
Yeah?

461
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,333
Oh, by the way, Tohru.

462
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,875
Yeah?

463
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,208
[KOBAYASHI] The way you used to
talk sounds like an old man.

464
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,333
Huh? Well, I think it's fancy!

465
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,875
[KOBAYASHI]
Whatever.

466
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,666
[HUMAN A]
How nice.

467
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,666
The weather's perfect.

468
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,708
[ELMA]
Oooh. I think I get that.

469
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,875
[sighs]

470
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,958
I've thoroughly
blended in to this world.

471
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,625
Meh. Is what it is.

472
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:36,208
[KOBAYASHI] Tohru, do you think
that bandit girl is still alive?

473
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,750
[TOHRU]
Who knows? But if she is,

474
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,416
I bet she's
serving as a maid.

475
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,625
[KOBAYASHI]
Same as you, then.

476
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:41,833
[TOHRU]
Exactly.

477
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Either way, I hope she's well.

478
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,208
[TOHRU]
I hope so, too.

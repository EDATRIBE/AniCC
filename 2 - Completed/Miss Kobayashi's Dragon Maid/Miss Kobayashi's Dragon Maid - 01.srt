Come check out Maid Café: Cozy.

[KOBAYASHI] Running that
new integration test

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,250
should be a straight-up

Having a good morning,
Miss Kobayashi?

I don't know yet.

26
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,625
Do you mind allowing
me in to your lovely home?

So, you say we met yesterday,

and I offered to
let you stay here.

31
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,333
With me. And you're for sure
positive that's what I said?

32
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,166
Indeed!

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,250
[KOBAYASHI]
This is weird.

00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,291
Why am I not waking up
from this dream?

00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,958
Unless it's not a dream.
There's no way.

36
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,750
So, um...
Remind me where we met?

37
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:34,750
The mountains!
We met in the mountains!

38
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,666
Mountains...

Apparently, a hilarious dragon.

I'll never forget
those wondrous words!

49
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,458
I can begin working
as your personal maid

50
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,083
immediately if you want!

51
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,583
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh, that's a big negative.

52
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,958
Huh?

53
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,625
[KOBAYASHI] I'm not like
a dragon racist or anything.

54
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,208
I'm just not in the market
right now to hire a maid.

55
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,333
[TOHRU gasps] But!
You wouldn't have to pay me!

56
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,833
Yeah, no, that's not really--

57
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,125
Listen, I can be super helpful!

58
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,166
I can turn this
area into a sea of fire,

59
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,375
or curse people to death!

60
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,875
[KOBAYASHI]
No, no, no!

61
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,666
But, why maid instead of that?

62
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,166
Because you said a maid
would work better for you!

63
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,666
I did, huh?

64
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,166
Yeah, does make sense...

65
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,166
I'm sorry, Tohru.

66
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,500
I shouldn't have
made that promise.

67
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,708
No one can change
the impossible.

68
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,875
It's not, like, personal.

[TOHRU gasps]

70
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,791
Are you certain...?

71
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,541
It's impossible?

72
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,958
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm-hmm... Sorry.

73
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,166
I understand.

74
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,416
My apologies as well,
for dropping in so suddenly.

76
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,791
Wanna stay with me, "dragon"?

00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,333
[KOBAYASHI] Why won't this
stupid guilt go away?

78
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,416
[KOBAYASHI] Maybe this dream...
is really not a dream.

79
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,916
And if it's not, then...

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,541
I'm late?! Tohru!

00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,833

Dragons are so fast!

00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,541
[TOHRU]
Sorry, what did you say?

88
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,000
You're hella fast!

89
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,333
I could keep her.

90
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,416
[TOHRU]
Are you serious?!

91
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,125
So, now you can hear me?

92
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,458
[KOBAYASHI] I guess it wouldn't
be the end of the world

93
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,833
to have someone
around the house.

94
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,958
And if she's there--

95
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,666
[yelps]

96
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,958
This is murdering my lower back!

97
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,541
[KOBAYASHI] Okay.
First, let's take a look at

98
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,666
what you've decided is
the proper outfit for a maid

99
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,083
and why that's totally wrong.

100
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,708
Great idea!

101
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,875
Here you go.

102
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,083
--Huh...?
--It's says Maid Café Cozy, see?

103
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,583
What is this?

104
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,583
I discovered some real life
maids while on my way here.

105
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,791
Meaning we'll have
to start from scratch.

106
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,333
First thing, as
a housemaid--you clean.

107
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,083
Oh, I'm good at cleaning!

108
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,125
--How's that?
--No! It's all gone!

109
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,166
[TOHRU]
One moment!

110
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,166
[KOBAYASHI]
You can bring it back?

111
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,875
Next! Laundry maid!
Do laundry.

112
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,666
I can handle that, too!

113
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,291
[muffled]
I can produce a saliva

114
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,416
that specifically
removes stains.

115
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,666
[KOBAYASHI]
Gross! No one wants to see that!

116
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,291
Next! Parlor maid!
Greet people.

117
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,708
Easy thing for me!

118
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,958
[doorbell]

119
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,833
Hi, I just need
a signature for this delivery.

120
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,833
The foolish, inferior human
is not welcome at this home!

121
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,625
--Hey.
--Oh, you're an exception

122
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,250
of course, Miss Kobayashi!

123
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Last one! Kitchen maid.

124
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,083
--You cook.
--Cooking is my specialty!

125
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,375
Try my very own roasted tail!

126
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,666
[KOBAYASHI]
No, thanks.

127
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,458
--[TOHRU] Huh?
--[KOBAYASHI] No way.

128
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,583
Wha--?!

129
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,416
Would you prefer it
well-done instead?

130
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,666
[KOBAYASHI]
That's not the problem.

131
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,666
Then I'm confident
you'll enjoy it immensely!

132
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,416
I'm ethically
against dragon tail.

133
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,166
Ah-hah! Seems you're
a picky eater, Miss Kobayashi!

134
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,208
Dragon logic.

135
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,833
[TOHRU growling]

136
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:50,958
[gulps]

137
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,750
[KOBAYASHI]
It grows back?!

138
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,083
Took a bit longer
than usual because

139
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,250
I had to remove all the poison.

140
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,541
[KOBAYASHI]
And it's poisonous?!

141
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,416
Hate to break it to you,
but you don't know how to maid.

142
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,625
[gasps] Then, I'll learn
from the ground up!

143
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,833
Shall we start my education with
you telling me what you dislike?

144
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,333
What I dislike?
I can't do <i>hijiki</i> or eggplant.

145
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,583
Interesting.
I'll remember that.

146
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,625
Personally, I dislike
eggs when the yolks

147
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,833
have been removed.

148
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,791
A while back, I had
a friend named Herensuge

149
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,000
who was hit with one and killed.

150
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,791
[KOBAYASHI]
That's a powerful egg.

151
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,291
Hold up. Why are you
asking about dislikes?

152
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,416
Shouldn't you ask what I like?

153
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,291
No, that's bad luck.

154
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,833
Unfortunately, I've had
far too many friends slain

155
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,500
by the very things
they love most.

156
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,833
You know--liquor and women
and jewels and such.

157
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,708
Sounds a lot like humans.

158
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,583
However, I can certainly
let you know one thing I like!

159
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,083
It's you! I love you,
Miss Kobayashi!

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,083
You gonna eat me?

161
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,041
[TOHRU] No, not like that!
Like sexually!

162
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,958
I'm not into women or dragons.

163
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,583
Yes, but I can't put a label
on what I feel for you!

164
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,916
You saved me, and I'll use my
whole body to repay the favor!

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,666
Please use me to commute
to work again tomorrow!

166
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,541
Thanks, but I got enough of
that earlier. You're hard.

167
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,208
Gimme a chance, Miss Kobayashi!

168
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,000
I was raised to pay back all
favors, even if they were only

169
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,541
owed to a foolish,
inferior human being!

170
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,791
Call me crazy, but I sense bias.

171
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,750
Tohru, there is another
reason I'd rather not

172
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,250
let you fly me to work.

173
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,458
[TOHRU]
Your back?

174
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,833
Well, that's half of it.
The other half is--

175
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,333
[KOBAYASHI]
You're too loud and too fast!

176
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,291
I think a dragon's place is in
the home holding down the fort!

177
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,833
Fort? What?

178
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,333
You're one of the
stronger dragons, aren't you?

179
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,458
If you consider
"starting Armageddon" strong.

180
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,208
I do, and please don't.

181
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,958
The world's dangerous enough
without your help.

182
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,583
I'm just saying it would
be a relief to know

183
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,583
you're here keeping
the house safe for me.

184
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,125
[gasps]
Yes, I understand!

185
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,958
So consider it done!

186
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,500
So pretty.

187
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,583
Well, I'm off to the office.

188
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,916
If anybody calls,
you can answer

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,708
and take a message, yeah?

190
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,708
[TOHRU]
What's a "calls"?

191
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,208
Right, you're a dragon.

192
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,833
This is a phone.

193
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,000
When it goes "ring-ring,"
you pick it up like so.

194
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:56,833
[TOHRU]
Okay, got it.

195
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,291
They talk, then you talk.

196
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,708
[TOHRU]
They talk, then I talk!

[giggles]

199
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,375
Hold the fort?

200

[TOHRU snarls]

201
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,291
Oh, is that what
those people were doing?

202
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,208
I'll just ask Fafnir for help!

203
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,791
[FAFNIR]
Kill them.

204
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,916
Kill all who try to
steal your treasure.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,708
Kill all who are suspect.

206
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:23,083
Curse them with death.
Curse their generations to come.

207
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,791
He's always so helpful!
All right!

208
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:29,250
Time to do my best to earn Miss
Kobayashi's love and praise!

209
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,833
[lock rattling]

210
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,458
[TOHRU]
Hmm?

211
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,291
The lady who lives here
should be gone all day,

212
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,625
but let's make this fast.

213
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,541
We'll be in there
before you can say "open."

214
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,083

Save us!

--[KOBAYASHI] Hmm?
--[THIEF A] There's a monster!

--[POLICE A] A monster?
--[THIEF B] We saw it, I swear!

222
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,250
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm home.

223
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,458
[TOHRU]
Welcome back!

224
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Hold the fort down all right?

225
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,375
[TOHRU]
I suppose, but it was lonely.

226
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,500
--[KOBAYASHI] Ahh.
--[TOHRU] And I didn't even

227

--get to kill them.
--[KOBAYASHI] Ahh.

228
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,166
Wait, what?

[KOBAYASHI groans]

[TAKIYA]
Hey, Kobayashi.

231
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,500
[KOBAYASHI]
What is it, Takiya?

232
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,375
Want to grab some
drinks tonight?

233
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,666
Sure, but, like, only one round.

234
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,041
[KOBAYASHI]
So why me?

235
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,375
There are plenty of
other girls you could ask.

236
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,791
I don't want to go on a date.

237
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,625
I asked you 'cause
you're like one of the guys.

238
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,958
Wow, how sweet.

239
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,875
[TOHRU growls]

240
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,208
[TAKIYA] What's with
that girl staring us down?

241
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,333
--Do you know her?
--Uh...

242
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,875
Greetings, I'm Tohru Kobayashi.
Miss Kobayashi's new maid.

00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,708
Her new <i>live-in</i> maid.
New <i>violent</i> live-in maid.

244
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,500
--[TAKIYA] Hmm.
--Yeah, it's my turn to

245
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,208
take care of the
"special" cousin.

246
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,916
I'm Makoto Takiya.

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,375
Kobayashi and I work together.
It's nice to meet you, Tohru.

248
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,166
And also you, Mister Takiya.

249
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,833
[TOHRU]
This man is clearly attempting

250
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,250
--to seduce Miss Kobayashi.
--[TAKIYA] Wait, are you even

251
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,250
--I shall not allow it!
--old enough to drink?

252
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,625
Of course I can drink.
You stultus.

253
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,791
Stultus?

254
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,166
[KOBAYASHI gulping]

255
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,583
Ah!

256
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,583
I love a good drink after work.
it's the best!

257
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,583
[TOHRU]
Miss Kobayashi's the cutest!

258
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,958
I take it you won't
be joining us in

259
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,208
our fight against sobriety?

260
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,458
I won't.

261
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,708
--[TAKIYA] Got it.
--[TOHRU] I do not intend

262
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,250
to share drinks with him.

263
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,458
What do I do
about this silly man?

264
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,458
The laws are too strict in this
world to do what I want.

265
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,541
I know!

266
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,708
--I can flaunt how wonderfully
--Man!

267
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,041
--close Miss Kobayashi
--Today was tough!

268
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,625
--and I have become!
--I don't care what you say.

269
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,125
We're only secondary
or tertiary subcontractors,

270
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,625
so why bother complaining?

271
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,916
Because I don't like how
following their directions

272
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,625
consistently means we fail.

273
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,625
And the developers don't even
notice unless we point it out.

274
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,250
But making sure
they don't have to notice

275
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,958
their faults is part of our job,
so again, why complain?

276
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,875
[TAKIYA] I just think foisting
their problems on us

277
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,208
is a pretty sucky thing to do.

278
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,625
[TOHRU] I can't follow
what they're saying at all.

279
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,250
Speak, Dragon, please.

280
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,625
[TAKIYA]
Ah, I'm so sorry, Tohru.

281
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,166
We're not exactly including
you in this discussion.

282
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,666
[TOHRU growls]
No, it's fine.

283
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,875
The topic's just so trite,
I don't feel like joining in.

284
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,041
[TAKIYA]
Okay...

285
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,791
We should be discussing
the ramifications

286
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,208
of Ragnarok and Armageddon!

287
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,250
[TAKIYA gasps]

288
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,083
It doesn't matter,
I've had enough!

289
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,541
Time to use force!

290
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,583
Let the jackals feed off you
when you're dead!

291
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,125
[gasps]

292
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,000
Miss Kobayashi...?

293
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,625
[sighs]

294
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,958
Tohru...

295
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:37,500
Good maids don't talk that way!
No threatening murder!

296
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,000
She's gone drunk!

297
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,208
On top of that, what's with
your so-called maid uniform?

298
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,583
It's pretty disrespectful to
maid-dom, if you ask me.

299
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,208
I mean, have a
little self-respect.

300
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,375
You look like you're about
to lose a cosplay contest.

301
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,208
[screams]

302
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,791
Um, Mister Takiya?

303
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,333
Kobayashi! You're right, she's
just your basic cosplay maid!

304
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,500
It's cultural appropriation
but without any culture!

305
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,250
Agreed! I can acknowledge
the cuteness of Gothic Lolita,

306
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,708
but that's a specific
fashion trend,

307
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,875
not cosplay! Why does
it get so twisted?!

308
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,291
That's what I'm screaming!

309
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,458
Sure, Lolita and the maid
fashion do acknowledge

310
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,541
each other, and rightfully so,
but they should be careful

311
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,583
not to blend into boring!

312
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,250
[TOHRU] I think we're
well beyond me just being

313
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,250
a part of this
conversation, now.

314
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,500
Hey, Tohru!

315
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,083
We're giving
you some high-level

316
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,208
maid conversation,
so you better get in on this!

317
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,125
Maid talk!

318
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,708
Yes... I'm very sorry...

319
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,791
You know, Tohru,
those horns are a nice,

320
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,958
if not confusing,
touch to the cosplay.

321
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,791
Dragons have horns, and
that is all I know about that.

322
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:32,708
Take it off.

323
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,541
--[TAKIYA] Huh?
--[TOHRU] Huh?

324
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,791
[KOBAYASHI]
Take it off!

325
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,250
--Huh...?
--Come on!

326
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,916
Gird your loins, sister!
Cosplay me crazy!

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,166
Where's the shame
in your role, maid?

328
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,083
[TOHRU]
I'm ashamed! [gasps]

329
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,291
Give me more! [snarls]

330
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,916
Show us what your
"moe" is made of!

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,333
--[TOHRU] This is insane.
--[KOBAYASHI] Bring more liquor

332
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,833
--Humans are terrifying!
--and maids! Victorian maids!

333
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,458
And don't forget a good butler!

334
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,166
[TAKIYA]
Sorry about that, Tohru.

335
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,416
Kobayashi and I go drinking
because we like to talk

336
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,208
about all things maid.

337
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,000
As an undercover otaku,
being able to share my passions

338
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,208
with someone else is
kind of precious to me.

339
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,458
I understand that perfectly.

340
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,791
And I'm assuming this means you
won't mind a little surprise.

341
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,375
[gasps]

342
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,291
[gasps]

343
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,250
Heh.

344
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,333
We can just say
I drank too much, too.

345
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,583
You really like
Kobayashi, don't you?

346
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,833
[TOHRU]
Yes.

347
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,166
[TOHRU] Since we're
being so honest,

348
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,083
you should know I hate you.

349
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,833
[TOHRU] Okay, so humans beings
all soil their clothing

350
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,250
with waste products?

351
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,583
[giggles]
Inferior species!

352
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,000
[giggles]
Miss Kobayashi's waste.

353
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,000
[moans]

354
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,791
Oh, there's no more left...

355
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,583
[KOBAYASHI groans]

356
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,166
I've said this before,

357
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,708
so don't make me say it again--
Please stop licking my laundry.

358
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,333
'Kay. Then, I'll take care of
it by licking you directly.

359
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,333
[KOBAYASHI] No licking me!
Can we discuss the laundry?

360
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,541
[TOHRU]
Am I doing it wrong?

361
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,000
[KOBAYASHI]
That's putting it mildly.

362
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,708
Tell me what you do
beginning to end.

363
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,458
Well, first, I use
my clairvoyance to make

364
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,833
certain your pockets are empty.

365
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,166
[KOBAYASHI]
Good.

366
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,791
[TOHRU] Then I separate
them into piles by color,

367
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,541
and wash them in
appropriate detergents.

368
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,791
[KOBAYASHI]
Good.

369
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,125
[TOHRU] Then I wash the
delicates in my mouth.

370
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,083
[KOBAYASHI]
No!

371
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,500
I told you I produce saliva

372
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,583
--that removes stains, yeah?
--So gross!

373
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,208
I told you nobody
wants to see that!

374
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,291
Oh. Would licking
make it better?

375
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,958
It's spit, not style!

376
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,375
Another thing. You can't wear
the same thing every day

377
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,583
like you're in some anime.

378
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,375
You're going to have
to change clothes, too.

379
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,125
But, these are my scales.

380
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,625
]
For real?

381
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,041
Yes. They're a part of me,
so I'd rather not take them off.

382
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,083
Oh. Makes sense.

383
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,333
[TOHRU]
Uh.

384
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,458
What's the matter?

385
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,291
[sighs]
It's just, uh...

386
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,541
I bought you some
personal clothes.

387
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,791
[gasps]

388
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,791
Thank you very, very much!

389
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,875
Well, you're doing
a lot for me, so I wanted,

390
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,666
um, to show appreciation.

391
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,166
[gasps]

392
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,958
Miss Kobayashi, would you like
to have a sacrifice later?

393
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,875
How fun. Care for
my fresh blood?

394
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,041
[KOBAYASHI]
What am I, a demon?!

395
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,500
Heavens no!
You're practically an angel!

396
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,250
But whatever you do,
please do not start serving God.

397
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,083
Look, just try it on.

398
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,583
[TOHRU]
Ah! [gasps]

399
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,750
--Well?
--[TOHRU] It's tight.

400
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,250
[KOBAYASHI growls]
What size bra do you wear?

401
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,625
A "D!" It
stands for "dragon!"

402
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,041
At least you bothered to
learn something. Gah.

403
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,291
Oh, crap, I gotta go.

404
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,791
All right, Tohru, use
the Internet to study up

405
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,333
appropriate hygienic
practices until I get home.

406
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,375
[TOHRU]
The inter-what?

407
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,833
Right. Dragon.

408
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,250
[TOHRU]
Oh!

409
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,750
[KOBAYASHI]
You look it up like this.

410
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,000
I understand!

411
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,583
I'll see you later, then.

412
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,000
[TOHRU]
Safe travels!

413
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,791
[TOHRU giggles]

414
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,291
The Internet!

415
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,125
[TOHRU] Hmm, I still
don't quite follow this.

416
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,833
I can just ask Fafnir
to help me out again.

417
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,833
--[FAFNIR] Kill them a--
--Or maybe not Fafnir.

418
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:28,833
Quetzalcoatl is knowledgeable,
so I'll try asking her.

419
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,416
Lucoa! Hey!

420
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,000
[LUCOA]
Tohru? It's been, like, forever.

421
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,500
[TOHRU] So blah-blah-blah
and yadda-yadda?

422
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,666
[LUCOA]
Mm-hmm...

423
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,083
Yeah...

424
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,083
This doesn't sound like a
problem of clean or dirty.

425
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,375
Huh?

426
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,416
[LUCOA] Well, you remember
Nidhogg, don't you?

427
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,166
[TOHRU] The one who gnawed
on that tree's roots?

428
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,166
[LUCOA]
The world's tree, yes.

429
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,250
No matter how much
Nidhogg's poisonous fangs

430
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,458
pollute Yggdrasill,
the goddesses purify it,

431
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,041
so the tree stays clean.
However...

432
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,583
[TOHRU]
Yes?

433
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,458
[LUCOA] What do you figure
happens to the spots he gnaws?

434
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,750
[TOHRU]
Ah...

435
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,750
As I recall,
he leaves energy behind.

436
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:01,791
Something like a curse?

437
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,291
[LUCOA]
Yep, that's it.

438
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,000
This Miss Kobayashi you speak
of is worried about that.

439
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,541
Of course!
Thank you very much!

440
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,250
[LUCOA]
Tohru.

441
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,291
Are you enjoying living
amongst the humans?

442
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,333
[TOHRU gasps]

443
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,791
[TOHRU]
I am!

444
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,833
[TOHRU] At this rate,
Miss Kobayashi's laundry

445
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,083
is never going to get dry.

446
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,416
I know!

447
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,375

449
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,583
Great work, Tohru.

450
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,166
Really starting to doubt
my maid teaching skills.

451
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,166
--[CROWD murmuring]
--[MAN A] What just happened?

452
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,916
I know that breath.

453
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,166
I know it well.

454
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,291

00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,291
[sighs]

457
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,250
--[KOBAYASHI whimpers]
--[TOHRU] Surely there's nothing

458
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,250
wrong with
inhaling the scent?

459
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,166
I don't imagine
you need sleep?

460
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,250
Nope. But I wanna
sleep with you,

461
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,291
so I think I'm gonna
go to bed anyway!

462
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,958
Whatever, do what you want.

463
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,083
I have a feeling you
don't mean that!

464
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,000
Well, nighty-night.

465
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,500
[TOHRU]
Yes, good night.

[TOHRU giggles softly]

468
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,208
[KOBAYASHI]
It's cramped.

[TOHRU gasps]

470
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,375
Do you want me to go?

471
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,958
[KOBAYASHI]
Nah, it's fine.

You okay?

[gasps]

481
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,333
It was a fight.
In another world.

482
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,541
I was run through by a sword.

483
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,541
I bet that hurt.

484
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,208
[TOHRU]
Yes, quite a lot.

485
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,916
And does it still hurt?

486
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,458
[TOHRU]
No. It doesn't hurt now.

487
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,708

That's good, then.

Welcome back home,
Miss Kobayashi!

493
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,375
I said welcome home.

00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,000
Welcome back, girl!

495
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,250
So, what are you
working on, Tohru?

496
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,500
[TOHRU] Miss Kobayashi!
Tell me what you like this time!

No, not you.

[TOHRU]
What else?

500
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,625
[KOBAYASHI]
I dunno, peace.

501
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,208
[TOHRU] So you're saying
I'm enough for you?

502
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,791
[KOBAYASHI]
Nope. I never said that.

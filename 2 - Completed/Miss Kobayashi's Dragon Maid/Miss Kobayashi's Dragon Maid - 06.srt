1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,083
Hey, so, um, Kanna...

2
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,833
Do you wanna come play
with me at my house?

3
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,166
You want me to play
at your house?

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,333
[SAIKAWA]
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,583
Will it be fun?

6
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:23,916
Are you kidding me?!

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,458
We have tons of games and
all the toys and snacks!

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, yeah! We have a maid, too!

9
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,500
A maid?

10
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,750
Yeah, you could bring your maid
with you if you wanted to!

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,458
You know, the one who
played dodge ball with us?

12
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,875
After I told my maid about it,

13
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,208
she said she would
really love to meet her.

14
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,416
She wants to talk maid shop
and that kinda stuff.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,833
So does that sound okay to you?

16
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,208
Yeah, sure.

17
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,000
[shrieks]

18
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,500
This is it?

19
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,041
So the loser who dares to
challenge my maid-dom

20
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,791
lives in this house?

21
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,041
I'll crush her!

22
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,458
[KOBAYASHI]
Sorry, why am I here, too?

23
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,083
Because you're the one
who knows the most about maids.

24
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,375
Hello and welcome
to my lovely home!

25
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,375
I see you brought your
maid and your, uh...?

26
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,083
[KANNA] This is Kobayashi.
She's my guardian.

27
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,083
Oh, it's very nice to
meet you, Kanna's mother.

28
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,166
What? Do I look old
enough to be her mom?

29
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,041
Don't let that bug you,
Miss Kobayashi.

30
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,291
After all, if you were my age,
you'd be old enough

31
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,958
to be every human's mom.

32
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,791
[GEORGIE] Young Lady,
I believe introductions are due.

33
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,041
If you say so.

34
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,916
Introducing... our,
um, our family's maid.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,291
[GEORGIE]
Pleasure to meet you.

36
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,583
My name is Georgie,
and I am proud to serve

37
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,541
this wonderful family.

38
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,875
What's that
outfit about, Georgie?

39
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't look like
much of a maid to me.

40
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,666
Where's the basic
black and white?

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,625
No. There's actually not
a set uniform for the maids

42
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,958
in this world.

43
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,166
Unfortunately, as the role
of servant grew larger

44
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,416
and more formal over
long periods of history,

45
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,458
their outfits evolved into what
is commonly thought of today.

46
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,041
Thank you.

47
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,333
This maid outfit is a simple one
created with the wages of a girl

48
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,833
who's recently
entered the service.

49
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,375
I am humbled.
You have a discerning eye.

50
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,458
You mean...

51
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,333
That's right. We are...

52
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,625
[BOTH]
Allies!

53
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,958
[TOHRU wails]

54
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,541
Please, Miss Kobayashi,
you can't let yourself be

55
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,458
influenced by this maid
and her ugly outfit!

56
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,416
Oh, yes, you must be Tohru.

57
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,916
I've heard rumors about you
in the shopping district.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,416
Honestly...

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,291
I've wanted to discuss maids
and, well, anything with you

60
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,458
for a while, now.

61
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,833
We're so ready!

62
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,541
[gasps]

63
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,125
Please, come this way!

64
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,375
[TOHRU whimpering]

65
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,791
[TOHRU]
Oh, god!

66
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,916
This is the first time
Miss Kobayashi's pulled me along

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,375
with such passion!

68
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,250
Okay, so, um...

69
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,250
You wanna go play
in my room, Kanna?

70
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,583
[KANNA]
Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,541
So, what should
we play? Any ideas?

72
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,125
What is that game?

73
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,291
[SAIKAWA]
Oh, yeah, this is Twister.

74
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,250
It's a kid's game.

75
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,000
I wanna try it.

76
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,333
Sounds good to me.
Let's give her a go.

77
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,583
[VOICE A]
Player one, left hand, yellow.

78
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,000
[SAIKAWA] You just gotta
follow the directions.

79
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,791
So I put my left hand on yellow.

80
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,166
[VOICE A]
Player two, right hand, blue.

81
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,166
You'll be player two, Kanna.

82
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,666
--[KANNA] Mm.
--[SAIKAWA gasps]

83
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,708
[VOICE A]
Player one, left foot, red.

84
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,416
Oh, red. Here I go.

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,791
[VOICE A]
Player two, right hand, blue.

86
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:48,833
[KANNA]
Blue.

87
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,250
[VOICE A]
Right foot, red.

88
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,583
Okay.

89
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,833
--[VOICE A] Left foot...
--[KANNA] ...green.

90
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:58,958
[SAIKAWA]
Ah, K-Kanna's so... So soft!

91
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,208
[SAIKAWA sighs]

92
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,958
I'd like to play a video game.

93
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,333
[gasps] Yeah, totally.
I have a ton of those!

94
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,708
A fun one, please.

95
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,375
Sure thing! A fun one!

96
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,291
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm! Smells so good.

97
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,875
Is it a first flush?

98
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,875
Impressive.

99
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,625
Interestingly,
I've recently acquired

100
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,416
some first flush Darjeeling.

101
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, I've heard about that!
It's a good, fresh tea, right?

102
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,416
You see... there are
a few things I know, too!

103
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Wow. This is beautiful.
Must be antique.

104
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,666
From the
Victorian era, obviously.

105
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,958
Can you believe I picked it
up at a flea market?

106
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,833
Georgie, mind if I ask what
made you such a fan of maids?

107
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,416
It was a children's
book I read that told

108
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,541
the story of a young girl
becoming a maid.

109
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,250
I know that book!
I read it, too!

110
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,125
Really? You did, Kobayashi?

111
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,375
They were
professionals entrusted

112
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,833
with taking care of the home.

113
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,250
The pride they had along with

114
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,625
such dignified character
moved me on a different level!

115
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,333
What about all those
costume changes?

116
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,166
Loved them and loved how
they had to pay attention

117
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,541
to their appearance even
when they were working!

118
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,000
[KOBAYASHI] Oh, my god,
I died over their posture!

119
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,458
[SAIKAWA]
How about this game?

120
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,541
[KANNA]
Sure.

121
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,791
[SAIKAWA]
All right.

122
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,000
Here you go.

123
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,125
[KANNA]
You sit there.

124
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,250
What?

125
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,875
[SAIKAWA]
Right here?

126
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,375
Wait, um...

127
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,708
That's perfect.
You're comfortable. Thanks.

128
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes! You're welcome!

129
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,625
Saikawa, I can't breathe.

130
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,833
[SAIKAWA]
Oh, I'm sorry.

131
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,458
I couldn't help myself.

132
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,291
[KANNA]
Hey, I have a question.

133
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,500
Okay?

134
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,750
Do you think
I'm getting along with

135
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,958
the kids in our class?

136
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,250
[SAIKAWA]
Well, of course you are!

137
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,458
You can do everything,
and everyone praises you

138
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,083
because of it.

139
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,625
[KANNA] I guess it just
feels different to me.

140
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,375
I can't explain this well,

141
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,875
but I want what Kobayashi
and Tohru have.

142
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,125
It's special, and I like that.

143
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,583
[gasps]
Listen, Kanna.

144
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,291
I think you know by now
that I like you a lot.

145
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,708
But I want to be even
closer to you than this.

146
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,333
Like married.
Oh, gosh. I said it.

147
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,416
--Fine.
--[SAIKAWA gasps]

148
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
I'm fine with that kind
of close. Ready?

149
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,708
Um... Yeah, but...

150
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,125
First... I need to
prepare my heart!

151
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,041
[KANNA]
Saikawa.

152
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,208
[SAIKAWA whimpers]

153
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,208
No! No more!

154
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,416
--Help!
--[KOBAYASHI] Don't run!

155
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,125
[GEORGIE] Join us in
our maid conversation!

156
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,041
Save me, Kanna!

157
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,625
[KOBAYASHI] So Georgie is
Saikawa's older sister, then?

158
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,125
Huh.

159
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,583
I wonder if Georgie is her real
name or just what she uses

160
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,500
when she's dressed
up like a maid.

161
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,625
[TOHRU] She wasn't actually
a maid, merely a maid fanatic.

162
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,708
I'm confused... So confused...

163
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,125
What was Kanna gonna
do to me earlier?

164
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,708
[inaudible]

165
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:49,958
...dragon style.

166
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:01,208
[KOBAYASHI]
Ugh. Will it ever stop raining?

167
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,666
Say no more!

168
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,500
Please don't do that.

169
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,500
Hold up, you mean
you also decided to move

170
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,958
from your world
to this one?

171
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,125
[LUCOA]
Mm-hmm!

172
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,791
[KOBAYASHI]
But why would you do that?

173
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,541
Well, lately I've been
hanging out with you guys

174
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,375
more regularly, and travel
can be such a beast, you know?

175
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,666
I dunno, I guess I just
like being closer.

176
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,291
What? Closer?

177
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,666
Yeah, I'm staying
at someone's house

178
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,291
not too far away, just like
Tohru's doing with you!

179
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,916
Hey, do you maybe
wanna swing by and see it?

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,583
As long as it's okay,
yes! Definitely.

181
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,916
Great, you can help with
the misunderstanding.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,916
The what?

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,500
So funny.

184
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,375
But our silly little mix-up is
partly why I thought staying in

185
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,000
this world would
be a good idea.

186
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,125
It all started one day
while I was on my way home

187
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,250
from here, mostly
minding my own business.

188
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,291
Wait, it feels like someone is
performing a ritual nearby.

189
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,000
What? A kiddo?

190
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,291
Might as well.

191
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,041
[gasps]

192
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,625
[TOHRU] So you seriously
let yourself get summoned

193
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,291
by a ritual performed
by a curious child.

194
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,333
And then you said,

195
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,125
"Sure, I'll be
your servant, kid."

196
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,541
Don't be so judgy.

197
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,750
Besides, this family is
apparently part of a long line

198
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,541
of mages, so it could
all wind up for the best.

199
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,208
Mind clarifying
the misunderstanding

200
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,541
that needs clearing up?

201
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,083
Yeah, so he got it into
his head that I'm a demon.

202
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,958
I was hoping you might be
willing to talk some sense

203
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,208
into him and make
my life easier.

204
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:35,125
Yay! We're here, guys!
Welcome to Shouta's house!

205
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,375
Well, come on in.

206
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,000
[KOBAYASHI]
Uh, sure it's okay?

207
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,208
No one's at home, now.

208
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,458
I swear, you're so paranoid.
Just follow me.

209
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm crashing in one
of the rooms upstairs,

210
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,916
so we can chill out in there.

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,250
You want some tea?

212
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,583
I'd offer something else,
but I don't have that.

213
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,166
--Hey.
--[LUCOA] Yeah?

214
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,250
I wanna ask something,

215
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,916
but I'm afraid it
might sound rude.

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,791
[LUCOA]
Hmm?

217
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,541
What the hell are you, Lucoa?

218
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,708
Yeah. Sounds rude.

219
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,041
[KOBAYASHI]
Sorry.

220
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,541
It's just I thought you
were a dragon like Tohru,

221
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,541
but now I'm thinking that
might not be the case.

222
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,458
My bad. Talk about rude!
I didn't tell you!

223
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,208
I don't have a category, per se,

224
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,083
but I guess you could call
me an ex-goddess.

225
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,708
Yeah, I like ex-goddess.

226
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,875
Why ex?

227
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,083
Because she was
served that cursed liquor,

228
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,666
and then while she
was drunk, she got all--

229
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,041
[LUCOA laughs]

230
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,375
Oh, yeah. You've
mentioned that before.

231
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,458
[TOHRU]
Long story short:

232
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,333
she was forced out of
being a goddess.

233
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,250
Then you might as
well be a demon.

234
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,833
[LUCOA] Well, I'm still
responsible for spreading

235
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,500
civilization far and wide,

236
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,250
so it's hard to call
myself a demon.

237
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,333
Plus, I'm like a
really good being, so...

238
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,625
I prefer, "ex-goddess,"
or "feathered serpent,"

239
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,291
or "Venusian," even!

240
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:38,083
Okay, ex-goddess
is gonna work for me, too.

241
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,250
Oh, sounds like
someone's home, now.

242
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,416
[LUCOA]
It's Shouta.

243
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,958
He's the one who summoned me.

244
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,041
[TOHRU]
Poor kid seems super fidgety.

245
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,041
[LUCOA] Right? He's always
like that when I'm home.

246
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,500
[KOBAYASHI] Well, when he's with
an older woman whose body

247
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,333
is an agitator of lust,
it's gotta be kinda unsettling.

248
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,541
I know, and that's why
I've tried to steady his nerves.

249
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,375
I've snuggled with him.
I've taken warm baths with him.

250
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,958
But none of it seems to work.

251
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,333
[groans]

252
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,833
[gasps]
She invited people!

253
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,666
Welcome home, Shouta, baby!

254
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,083
Bad demon, I know you know

255
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,083
a familiar can't
act on their own!

256
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,625
You're gathering allies!

257
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,416
Are you planning to take over
our home, because no, ma'am!

258
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,625
Fancy. He really wants
to be the strong guy, huh?

259
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,791
I know, he's adorable!

260
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:26,875
[SHOUTA whimpers]

261
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,125
Sorry. Can you forgive me?

262
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,041
[SHOUTA whimpers]
Yes. As long as you behave.

263
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,166
Look, I get it's scary
to have people at your house

264
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,208
you don't know, but I invited
them here to help you

265
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,916
understand me better.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,291
[gasps]
What do you mean?

267
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,875
I want you to know
I'm not a demon.

268
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,500
I'm a dragon, isn't that fun?

269
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:47,000
Stop lying! I used
a demon summoning circle.

270
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,500
Which I noticed
and thought it might be

271
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,208
a little dangerous
for someone your age,

272
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,083
so before a mean
ol' demon could show up,

273
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,166
I decided to answer
the call first!

274
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,750
What? No way.

275
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,166
I-I don't have enough magical
power to summon a dragon, yet.

276
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,500
[gasps] No, you're just
bluffing to make yourself

277
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,458
seem more powerful
and trustworthy!

278
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,833
Bad demon!
You won't fool me!

279
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,083
Literally does this
every time I try. It's so cute.

280
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,333
[KOBAYASHI]
Womb crippling.

281
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,333
--Hey, Shouta?
--[SHOUTA] Yes?

282
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,750
I've heard
about how you're from

283
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,583
a family of mages, so...
why perform a summoning ritual?

284
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,291
Um... It's 'cause...

285
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,791
I wanted to be accepted, now...
To be a full-grown mage.

286
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,916
Mages live pretty quietly here.

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,833
But we maintain our power for
when we return to our world.

288
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,500
My father's been in charge of
that all by himself.

289
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,250
He's working hard
to pass down his knowledge

290
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,333
and strength to me, but it
seems like it's taking forever.

291
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,708
I just want to be better faster.

292
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,125
Ah, so you summoned
Lucoa in order to prove

293
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,166
that you have your own power
because of daddy issues.

294
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,166
Wow, kinda makes me
feel bad for Lucoa.

295
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,041
[gasps] I never
thought about it like that.

296
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,291
[KOBAYASHI]
Let's say she was a demon,

297
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,958
sure would suck to be
summoned for no reason,

298
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,375
and what exactly were
you planning to do

299
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,291
after she materialized
in front of you?

300
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,750
Take her along
to elementary school?

301
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,708
Why would any demon
stay with you?

302
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,166
You're right! Everything
you say is the truth!

303
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,208
For real?

304
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,916
She's right, Lucoa,
and I'm sorry.

305
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,125
[LUCOA] Wait, does this mean
he's gonna want me to leave?

306
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,416
Please, don't send me away!
I don't want to go home!

307
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,708
You wanna stay?

308
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,333
But you can't just
live at someone's house

309
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,208
and do nothing in return, Lucoa.

310
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,541
I mean, take a look at me
and Miss Kobayashi.

311
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,875
I'm working as a
splendid maid to help her.

312
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,583
Uh, "splendid"?

313
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,875
Don't be mean!

314
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,541
My mom takes
care of all the housework

315
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,041
and stuff like that.

316
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,708
[LUCOA] Huh... In other words,
what you're saying is that

317
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,791
I need to do something
specific for Shouta

318
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,833
if I want to live in his house?

319
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,625
How would you feel
about me giving you more gold

320
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,291
than you could ever use!

321
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,708
I don't need it
because my dad is

322
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,375
really good at alchemy.

323
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,125
Does agricultural
technology sound like fun?

324
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,583
No way. I don't
wanna be a farmer.

325
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,791
Everyone could use
some crazy strong charisma,

326
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:50,958
am I right?

327
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,333
I think that would
just cause more problems

328
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,541
than it's worth.

329
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,500
How about vast magical
powers, then?

330
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,416
[SHOUTA] Hmm... Now
that one is kind of appealing.

331
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,958
Consider it settled.

332
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,041
[SHOUTA]
But no, thanks.

333
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,541
No? But why?

334
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,625
I don't believe there's
a point in having vast power

335
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,125
if you haven't worked hard
to earn it for yourself.

336
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,333
Wha...?

337
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,166
Gotta admire the integrity.

338
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,708
Lucoa, it doesn't look
like you're gonna be

339
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,250
any help to him.

340
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,708
There's one more thing.
And it's all I have left.

341
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,708
[yelps]

342
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,958
My body.

343
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,333
[gasps] I knew it!
You're a demonic succubus!

344
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,916
[LUCOA]
What? Oh, no...

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,333
Yeah, you basically tied
your own noose with that move.

346
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,000
[KOBAYASHI]
That was awesome.

347
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,125
It's nice to see Lucoa get
flustered every once in awhile.

348
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,583
[TOHRU] All that effort,
and she's just gonna be

349
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,791
treated like a succubus.

350
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:41,916
[KOBAYASHI]
By the way.

351
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,166
[TOHRU]
By the what?

352
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,208
[KOBAYASHI] I noticed
something that struck me

353
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,000
as unnerving about that house.

354
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,541
[TOHRU]
Oh. Really? Do tell!

355
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,166
From what I could see,
it was pretty ordinary.

356
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,250
[KOBAYASHI] It's about
who Shouta's father is.

357
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,083
[KOBAYASHI] I saw some pictures
of him around the house.

358
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,291
I think he's the director
of my company.

359
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,625
[TOHRU]
What? Small world, huh?

360
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,083
[gasps]

361
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,500
Hey, Shouta!

362
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,041
[screams]
Stay back!

363
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,250
Get out of here, demon!

364
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,083
[LUCOA] Come on.
I told you I'm not a demon.

365
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,333
--Look at me.
--[SHOUTA] Go away, succubus!

366
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,833
Bad girl!

367
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,875
--[LUCOA] Just look at me.
--[SHOUTA] Don't come near me!

368
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,791
[TOHRU]
It's still pouring.

369
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,541
This must be what
"rainy season" means.

370
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,958
Let's hang these up.

371
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,250
What is that? A ghost?

372
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,166
A <i>teru teru bouzu</i> .

373
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,250
<i>Teru teru bouzu</i> ?

374
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,833
Will something
that simple really make

375
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,250
the rain stop?

376
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,625
[KOBAYASHI]
Eventually, yeah.

377
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,791
I'm off, Kobayashi.
Have a good evening.

378
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,583
Yeah, same to you.

379
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,916
Guess I should head home, too.
I'm hungry, anyway.

380
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,791
[TOHRU] Looks like someone
didn't put in overtime today.

381
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,541
I gotta admit, I'm happy you
came home early!

382
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,083
[KOBAYASHI]
I come home when I can.

383
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,375
Takiya went home at
the regular time, too.

384
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,916
Stultus...

385
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,875
Y'know, I haven't
heard anything

386
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,416
from Takiya about Fafnir.

387
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,541
I hope they've been
getting along okay.

388
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,583
Now that you mention it,

389
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,708
I haven't seen
Fafnir much lately.

390
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,958
I saw him today.

391
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,166
[KOBAYASHI]
What? Where?

392
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,041
On the way home from school.

393
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,208
He was in the park jumping in
circles over and over.

394
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,208
He was mumbling something, too.

395
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,750
That cursed dragon, what on
earth could he be up to? Jeez.

396
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,208
[KOBAYASHI]
Yeah, no way that's innocent.

397
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,750
--What do kings do?!
--They rule.

398
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,125
--Citizens!
--They suck.

399
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,166
--Nyami-nyami.
--Rules.

400
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,041
[BOTH]
Kaboom.

401
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,708
[TAKIYA] Nice! You're
really nailing this.

402
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,875
You've improved
so much, Faf- <i>kun</i> !

403
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,875
That's great,
but who's Faf- <i>kun</i> ?

404
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,416
Not you if you
don't want it to be.

405
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,750
My apologies, Fafnir.

406
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,500
[TAKIYA] How do you feel knowing
you're ready for the call

407
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,791
and respond part of
tomorrow's event?

408
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,583
[FAFNIR] I can now obtain
a limited-edition item

409
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,333
at said event, yes?

410
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,541
[TAKIYA]
Indeed!

411
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,375
We're having curry
for dinner tonight.

412
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,333
[FAFNIR]
Mild?

413
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,375
[TAKIYA]
As requested.

414
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,333
Thank you for everything.

415
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,791
Let's roll.

416
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,041
I will not lose.

417
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,500
Damn it, traps!

418
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,291
[TAKIYA]
What are you doing?

419
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,500
What'd you hide?

420
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,333
[FAFNIR] You idiot,
you can't go that way!

421
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,625
[TAKIYA]
Boom, got the weapon!

422
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,250
I fainted.

423
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,500
Victory is mine anew.

424
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,625
I know.

425
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,250
[FAFNIR]
I'll win next time.

426
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,083
[TAKIYA]
Bring it on anytime, man.

427
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,041
[sighs]

428
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,583
Hey, uh, Fafnir, I've got
this game I'd like you to try

429
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,208
playing for just a little bit.

430
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,875
The one you're selling
at Comiket again?

431
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,416
Yep, that's the one.

432
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm about to the
80% mark, now.

433
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,208
Where is that?

434
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,166
About there, give or take. Yeah?

435
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,458
Can you not...
add something here?

436
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,625
Gotcha.

437
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,833
You know, I thought
this felt slow, too.

438
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,541
I've been wondering.

439
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,916
Do you know how many hours
a day you're logged in roughly?

440
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,250
[FAFNIR] Somehwere
around 21 hours.

441
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,250
And what level are you
at the moment?

442
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,791
[FAFNIR]
Level 280.

443
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,750
I've cleared all the limited
time events, so I'm free, now.

444
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,625
On the fast track to
game addiction, huh?

445
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,750
[FAFNIR]
Hmm.

446
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,333
[growls]

447
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,833
[growls]

448
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,916
[growls]

449
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,875
[TAKIYA] Oh, right,
I've got a surprise for ya.

450
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,125
What is it?

451
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,333
[TAKIYA] I grabbed some
shampoo-conditioner

452
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,166
on my way home
from work for you.

453
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,125
And that will help me
with my hair?

454
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,833
It should, yeah.

455
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,458
[sighs]

456
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,833
You shooting for
another all-nighter?

457
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,958
Wish I could, but I gotta sleep.

458
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,750
Good night, Fafnir.
Stay strong, man.

459
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,500
Morning, Fafnir...

460
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,583
I knew you could do it.

461
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,916
We're having natto
for breakfast, 'kay?

462
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,958
Is it mild?

463
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,541
Sure, why not?

464
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,375
[KANNA]
Rain, rain, rain.

465
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,541
Rain, rain, rain!

466
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,333
I can't not love
how happy Kanna is

467
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,750
about her new umbrella!

468
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,083
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm-hmm.

469
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,333
What are you doing?

470
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,250
You really don't know,
Miss Kobayashi?

471
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,500
This is called sharing
a lover's umbrella.

472
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,208
I know that's
what you think this is,

473
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,125
but you have your own umbrella.

474
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,541
[TOHRU giggles]
Yes, but I prefer yours!

475
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,791
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm...

476
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,875
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

477
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,458
Good, it seems
they're getting along okay.

478
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,750
I shouldn't say this
after recommending him,

479
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,875
but Mister
Takiya's incredible.

480
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,458
Being able to live with
Fafnir is no easy feat.

481
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,250
[FAFNIR] Humans are
either hits or misses.

482
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,458
The misses make
themselves known quickly,

483
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,083
but it takes time to know
if you've found a hit.

484
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,708
Spending that
much time on every person

485
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,791
would be too aggravating.

486
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,000
As far as I'm concerned,

487
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,708
the misses that trespass
on my home to steal

488
00:20:56,791 --> 00:21:00,791
my treasure are my
favorite humans.

489
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,666
Why did you wait outside?

490
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,750
[FAFNIR]
And yet...

491
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,916
I can't wait for
today's event, can you?

492
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,916
Faf- <i>ku</i> -- Oh...

493
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,083
I don't mind.

494
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:09,916
Huh?

495
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,791
You're a hit, Takiya.

496
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:12,750
I am?

497
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,041
Hurry up.

498
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,250
Oh! Right behind ya!

499
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,916
Our <i>teru teru bouzu</i>
ghosts aren't working at all.

500
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,333
Nope. Rain, rain, go away.

501
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,875
I love rain. I love it so much.

502
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah, you're right.

503
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,375
Rain's not all that bad.

504
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,333
[SHOUTA] Lucoa, you're forbidden
from approaching me

505
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,208
naked from now on!
That's an order!

506
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,916
[LUCOA] But my clothes are my
scales, so I'm always naked.

507
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,291
I'm naked right this minute!

508
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,333
[SHOUTA]
What? No! Bad demon!

509
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,666
[whines]

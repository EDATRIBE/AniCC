00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,916
Huh?

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
Wait this is our room?

178
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,958
[KOBAYASHI] Yep. You can do
whatever you want with it.

179
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,583
[BOTH gasp]

180
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,083
Yay!

181
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,666
--[laughs]
--[sighs]

182
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,416
[KOBAYASHI sighs]

183
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,375
[KOBAYASHI]
A whole new life.

184
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,333
--[door clicks]
--[KOBAYASHI] Hmm?

185
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,125
Shall I wash your back for you?

186
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,458
[KOBAYASHI]
What? No, I'm fine.

187
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,708
You said you liked it
when I made things clean.

188
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,083
That is what you said, right?

189
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:09,458
Ugh, that's your angle?
Okay, fine, come on in.

190
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,583
Okay.

191
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,875
[KOBAYASHI]
I have a question.

192
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,083
[TOHRU]
Yes?

193
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,208
[KOBAYASHI]
Wouldn't it be easier for you

194
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,958
to wash your body
in your human form?

195
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,541
[TOHRU] Technically, yes.
But I can't be as thorough.

196
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,625
All of the confusing
and finicky rules

197
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,583
in this world don't
help, either.

198
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,291
I find the whole thing
a little stifling.

199
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,916
You don't like your
human form, do you?

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,666
[gasps]
Yes!

201
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,791
[grunts]

202
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,125
And no, it's complicated.

203
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:48,916
Sure.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,666
[KANNA]
Knock, knock. I'm coming in!

205
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,250
Lady Tohru, wash me, too?

206
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,583
[TOHRU]
Of course I will!

207
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,166
[KOBAYASHI]
Ugh, too close!

208
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,625
[TOHRU giggles]

209
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,375
Here I go!

210
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,958
[KOBAYASHI]
Morning, Tohru.

211
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,375
Hey, Miss Kobayashi!
Hope you slept well!

212
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,166
[KOBAYASHI]
Tohru.

213
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,666
Uh, yes?

214
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,416
[KOBAYASHI] Want me to wash you
as a thanks for yesterday?

215
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,291
Do I?

216
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,500
Well, hurry up.

217
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,083
[TOHRU]
What? Okay!

218
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,916
[TOHRU sighs]

219
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,708
Thank you...
This is incredible...

220
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,583
[KOBAYASHI]
Feels like I'm washing a car.

221
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,041
[TOHRU]
Oh, thank you.

222
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,333
Miss Kobayashi,
you're the best.

223
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,791
[KOBAYASHI]
You're welcome, Tohru.

224
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,166
[gasps]
This is the old apartment!

225
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,000
[groans]
Damn it, why am I so stupid...?

226
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,208
[sirens blare]

227
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,916

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,541

[KOBAYASHI groans]

233
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,583
Tohru, that's way too loud!

234
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,333
Huh?

235
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,458
[KOBAYASHI]
Or not.

236
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,875
[KOBAYASHI groans]

237
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,375
Do you believe me
to be a loud person?

238
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,000
[KOBAYASHI]
No, I'm sorry.

239
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,791
[KANNA] Kobayashi, is your
hangover making your head hurt?

240
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,041
[KOBAYASHI]
Yeah...

241
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,125
I can't believe I feel
like this on my day off.

242
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,708
The noises sound
like they're coming from

243
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,333
both neighbors and above.

244
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,458
Would you like me to
speak with them about it?

245
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:17,458
[KOBAYASHI] Actually, if you
would, that would be great.

246
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,791
Make sure your horns
don't stick out, though.

247
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,166
Sure, no problem!

248
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,708
And if they refuse
to listen to me,

249
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,416
I'll just murder, dismember,
and pulverize them!

250
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,041
Seems excessive.

251
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,583
[TOHRU] I'll start with
Miss Sasakibe on our right.

252
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,958
[doorbell rings]

253
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,125
[SASAKIBE]
Coming.

254
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,625
Hello. Oh.
You're from next door.

255
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,791
[TOHRU]
I'm Tohru. How are you?

256
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,291
I'm good, thanks.
Did you need something?

257
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,958
Well... we've been hearing
some really loud noises,

258
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,666
so I decided to
come check it out.

259
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,291
I didn't realize
I was that loud.

260
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,166
What are you doing? Pillaging?

261
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,375
Just cooking.

262
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,166
[TOHRU]
Huh...?

263
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,791
Stay here a quick minute.

264
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,625
[TOHRU yelps]

265
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,625
Here, allow me to share some.
Stewed rapeseed blossoms.

266
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,333
Wow, thank you so much!

267
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,833
And if it wouldn't be
too much trouble,

268
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,375
would you try keeping
the noise down?

269
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,500
Sure.

270
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,166
[TOHRU] How could this
make such a racket?

271
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,750
[TOHRU] Now for Mister
Yana on the left side.

272
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,375
What? I'm playing music.

273
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,625
Playing music?

274
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,125
Yeah, want to listen?

275
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:22,208
--[screams]
--[heavy metal music]

276
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,750
[screaming continues]

277
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,625
Are you the god of
the underworld because

278
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,833
you sound like Hades
crushing Hercules.

279
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,791
Best compliment ever. Rock on.

280
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,583
[TOHRU] Anyways, please try
to keep the volume down.

281
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,958
[YANA]
Mm-hmm.

282
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,416
[TOHRU] Last is Mister Sone
on the floor above.

283
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,958
I'm sorry, but I have
to use a drill for work.

284
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,125
A drill?

285
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,458
Yes, I make hand-carved
wooden figurines.

286
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,333
Ooh, a gorilla!

287
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,416
That's really well done!

288
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,791
Anyway, one of the girls
I live with is suffering

289
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,583
from a hangover.
So please try to keep it down?

290
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,916
Yeah. I'll try.

291
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,750
[SASAKIBE]
You're the loud one!

292
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,208
[YANA]
No, I'm pretty sure that's you!

293
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,666
[SONE]
Or it's you both!

294
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,125
[SASAKIBE] This from the guy
who has to be the loudest

295
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,625
--in the room?
--[growling]

296
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,708
[TOHRU]
What's going on out here?

297
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,125
His drilling is way too loud!

298
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,625
The death metal's too loud!

299
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,375
That creepy noise is too loud!

300
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,791
All I'm doing is cooking!

301
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,000
[SONE, YANA]
Huh?

302
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,250
At the moment, all three
of you are too loud.

303
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,375
[GROUP]
We're sorry, Tohru.

304
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,750
[TOHRU]
Why do humans always make

305
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,958
the same mistakes over and over?
They're beyond help.

306
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,916
I'll kill them.

307
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,583
Excuse me. If I could
have a word, please?

308
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,958
[ALL]
Hmm?

309
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,458
The problem we're all
having is that everyone else

310
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,208
manages to be loud
precisely when

311
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,833
we'd rather things to be quiet.

312
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,416
So why don't we
organize all the times

313
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,708
we don't want to have a bunch
of noise driving us insane,

314
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,125
and plan around it?

315
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,916
We'll make a schedule out
of our noise preferences.

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,083
[gasping]

317
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,375
If some times don't work out,

318
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,333
then we can use the
power of the earplug.

319
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,875
[TOHRU] And you're certain
this plan is acceptable?

320
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,833
These are creatures that
haven't learned anything

321
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,083
since evolving from apes.

322
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,041
You know I'm one of
those creatures, right?

323
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,708
--[TOHRU] Mm.
--It's not a big deal.

324
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,458
I wouldn't mind so much if I
wasn't dying in hangover hell.

325
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,333
Besides, it's only
natural for people

326
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,375
who are going about their lives
to annoy other people

327
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,041
who are simply
going about theirs.

328
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,750
That's the definition
of neighbors.

329
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,500
[sighs] You might be
too good for your own good.

330
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,833
No, I'm not.

331
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,708
[KOBAYASHI]
I wouldn't like things if they

332
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,041
were too quiet either.

333
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:14,958
[TOHRU gasps]

334
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,958
[KOBAYASHI yawns]

335
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,791
I'm gonna take a nap real quick.

336
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:22,958
[TOHRU]
Of course.

337
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,166
Do you consider me
to be too loud?

338
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,916
[KOBAYASHI chuckles]
There are times when I feel

339
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,166
like you are, yeah.

340
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,000
Does it, um, annoy...?

341
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,291
[KOBAYASHI] Hmm. Kinda difficult
to give a precise answer

342
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,041
to that question.

343
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,708
[TOHRU sighs]

344
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,291
[KOBAYASHI]
However...

345
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:04,166
For what it's worth, this life's
fine. Good enough for me.

346
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,291
[gasps]

347
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,833
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm gonna sleep now.

348
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,083
Right. Then I will, too.

You're being too loud!

00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,333
[TOHRU hums]

352
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,375
[KANNA sighs]

353
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,916
[KOBAYASHI]
What should I do about this?

354
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,958
I don't like slowing down
so I can be considerate

355
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,166
of management's
inability to drink like me.

356
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,333
Straight to the point as always.

357
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,666
Hmm... You should create
an excuse not to go.

358
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,250
An excuse?

359
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,791
[TOHRU]
We're having a party?

360
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,208
[KOBAYASHI]
Yeah.

361
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,000
I was talking to Takiya about
doing something here.

362
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,666
I need an excuse to get out of
my job's flower viewing thing.

363
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,541
You invited that man
to our home?

364
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,041
Oh, stop making that face.

365
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,541
He's a nice guy.
Give him a chance. Please?

366
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,375
[TOHRU growls]
I suppose so,

367
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,833
but I'm only putting up
with him for you.

368
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,791
--[KOBAYASHI] How mature.
--In return, can I invite

369
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,416
some of my friends, too?

370
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,125
Friends like who? People
from the shopping district?

371
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,375
[TOHRU]
No, like dragons.

372
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,083
Huh?

373
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,458
[TOHRU]
Don't worry.

374
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,166
They're all extraordinarily
well-behaved dragons.

375
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,666
[KOBAYASHI]
Ugh. Why isn't that comforting?

376
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,125
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm here.

377
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,833
Welcome back home!

378
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,291
Surprise. I'm here, too!

379
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,166
Oh, hi. Welcome. Come in.

380
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,541
[TAKIYA] Funny how
I don't feel very welcome.

381
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,583
Now, you must be Kanna.
Nice to meet you.

382
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,958
Nice to meet you.

383
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,583
[TAKIYA]
I like your goth-loli thing.

384
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,791
[KANNA]
Hmm.

385
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,000
[KOBAYASHI]
Where are your friends, Tohru?

386
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,833
[TOHRU]
They should be here soon.

If you'll give me
one moment, please.

Fafnir, no!

390
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,208
Make yourself look like
the picture I sent to you!

391
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,458
[FAFNIR]
Good grief.

392
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,416
I hate this and everything
it stands for. Kill me.

393
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,708
[FAFNIR]
I'm already dead inside.

394

[BOTH gasp]

395
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,291
Miss Kobayashi,
I'd like you to meet Fafnir.

396
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,583
[KOBAYASHI] Hello, Fafnir,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

397
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,166
[TAKIYA] That is what's known
as a polite social greeting.

398
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,583
[KANNA]
Polite social greeting?

399
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,500
It's a magical set of
words that helps even

400
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,291
the shyest of people introduce
themselves with confidence.

401
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,083
[KOBAYASHI] Tohru, I have
a feeling your friend

402
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,833
might be hostile towards me.

403
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,458
That makes sense. He does have
a slight dislike for humans.

404
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,750
We're talking about an ancient
cursed dragon who's been

405
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,000
guarding his treasure in
a cave for, like, ever.

406
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,333
[KOBAYASHI]
You mean Hobbit style?

407
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,958
--[doorbell rings]
--[KOBAYASHI] Hm? There're more?

408
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,458
[TOHRU]
This one's the last.

409
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,458

Hey, Tohru.

410
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,875
Hi, there!
It's been way too long!

411
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,958
Miss Kobayashi,
this is Quetzalcoatl.

412
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,666
So cool to meet you.
Please, call me Lucoa.

413
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,666
I'm gonna assume all
dragons look this unrealistic.

414
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,000
--Huh?
--Oh, never mind.

415
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,708
It's cool or whatever
to meet you, too.

416
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,750
[LUCOA]
Hmm? Everything chill?

417
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,916
[KOBAYASHI]
Yeah, but...

418
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,166
Did you walk here
wearing that "ensemble"?

419
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,375
[LUCOA]
Of course I did.

420
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,541

Doesn't really leave a whole lot

421
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,750
to the imagination, does it?

You wanna give it a try?

426
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,875
Now, when you get a hit,
be sure to move back a little.

427
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,166
Just like that.

428
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,583
Oh, you can't attack
when he's doing that move.

Hey, you killed him!

you know what's good for ya.

[TOHRU hums]

441
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,833
It's great to see Tohru smiling;
she's not normally the type.

442
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,791
--[KOBAYASHI] Hmm?
--I assume that's thanks to you.

443

Doubtful. I'm just
a normal human being.

444
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,500
Could be what she needed since

445
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,916
she's never had anything
normal before.

446
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,583
Her friends are the same way.

447
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,916
You know, Lucoa. To be honest,
I'm grateful to Tohru, as well.

448
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,125
Truth is... I didn't use
to smile very much myself.

449
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,041
I'd never admit that
to her, though.

450
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,250
[LUCOA giggles]

451
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,000

Watch out for her tail.
Can I get you anything to drink?

[LUCOA]
Drink? Yes, thank you.

455
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,125
But, no offense, I'll need
to check it for curses.

456
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Curses?

457
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,458
Oh, yeah, forever ago, Lucoa,
who was still a goddess

00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,291

major drama go down

to drink some alcohol

which made her get all sloppy

a dragon's past is never good.

I say give me middle-aged
or give me death!

468
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,083
The young, handsome,
and devilish butler has been

469
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,333
taking the world by storm,
and say what you will,

--but he's here to stay, sister!
--Stop messing me up.

wanna be a maid, don't you?

[TOHRU]
I thought I already was one.

I've told you before,
that's basic cosplay!

478

then take it off!

--[TOHRU] Why?!

480

--[KOBAYASHI] And confess!
--We must avert our eyes to

--Please, don't look!
--[FAFNIR growls] Stop it!

I love how no one can not
move their body to that.

486
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,333
[TAKIYA] Fafnir, remember
to ignore that treasure chest.

[FAFNIR growls]

488
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,916
[TAKIYA]
Aw. It's a mimic.

489
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,250
No, don't go to that one either.

490
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,166
[FAFNIR snarls]

491
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,666
[TAKIYA]
That was a mimic, too.

492
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,541
Why do you instinctively go
after all the treasure?

493
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,875
[FAFNIR sighs]
It's my nature.

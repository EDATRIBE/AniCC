00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,375
[KOBAYASHI] She's been watching
school kids a lot lately.

00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,500
You think she might
be wanting to go?

00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:30,916
Who, Kanna?

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,875
Yes, I would assume so.
It's only natural, after all.

6
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:37,083
Eventually, every dragon
wrestles with ideas like death.

Oh, youth!

Uh. What are you talking about?

00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,583
Kanna's journey to
eliminate humanity?

10

[KOBAYASHI]
No, jeez.

11
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,250
I meant "think she might
be wanting to go to school"?

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,458
[TOHRU]
Oh, right.

13
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,500
I see stuff about school
on the Internet all the time.

Hmm?

Hey, Kobayashi.
Did you need something?

19
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:13,708
No, I was just wondering...
Do you want to go to school?

You should treat Miss Kobayashi
with more respect!

24

I don't understand why you need
all this just to go to school.

25
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,458
[TOHRU] There's nothing to
understand once you recognize

That's doubtful

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,125

fall for online BS, too.

[KOBAYASHI]
Why are we here?

45
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,708
Because feathers that
have been plucked from

year produce the best pens!

This doesn't make sense.

Back in our world, practically
everybody uses quill pens.

I want a cute one, though.
A cute one!

wants a cute one.

C'mon, it's obvious. That is
a tool for slave branding.

go with a cursed backpack

They want the kids to
all wear the same thing

00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,708
so they'll all look the same.

I know it might be
different for dragons,

accepting of people

agree with you.

00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,625
[SAIKAWA]
Hmm? Sure, sounds fun.

347
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,333
Let's play on the seesaw.

348
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,041
[gasps, screams]

349
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,291
[TEEN B]
Sorry about that, girls.

350
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,458
Be more careful, you idiots!

351
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,708
What's wong? Widdle baby
fwightened by a widdle ball?

352
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:32,666
Don't be a jerk. We're sorry.
Sometimes, dodgeball gets crazy.

353
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,625
And? Little kids come
here to play, too,

354
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,083
so you should leave if you
can't handle your dumb game.

355
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,458
Nowhere else to go.

356
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,666
[We wouldn't leave if
there was somewhere else.

357
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,500
It's time for the
babies to go home.

358
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,541
[SAIKAWA growls]

359
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,166
For real, dude, who hurt you?

360
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,125
You'll pay.

361
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,375
[TEEN B]
What?

362
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,708
I challenge you to
a dodgeball game tomorrow!

363
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,958
If you lose,
you can't play here!

364
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,291
[TEENS]
Uh...

365
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,666
--[laughing]
--You hear that?!

366
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,083
The infant thinks
she's gonna defeat us!

367
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,625
Yeah, we're not gonna
play with you,

368
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,916
but thanks for the offer--
we appreciate it.

369
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,458
Why, what's wrong? You scared?

370
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,458
Maybe you're afraid you're
gonna get embarrassed

371
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,333
in front of all your nerdy,
loser friends?

372
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,000
Try not being so chicken!

373
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,416
What did you say?

374
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,875
Don't listen to her, man.

375
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,916
[SAIKAWA] Or don't listen
to that mama's boy!

376
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,083
Huh?

377
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,375
Wanna call your mom
to see if she thinks

378
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,666
you can win against us,
mama's boy?

379
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,416
Is that what you need?
"Help me, Mama, help me!"

380
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,000
You are such a brat.

381
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,416
What's wong?

382
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,375
Are the big, bad boys fwightened
by a widdle, baby girl?

383
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,083
Hmph. Pathetic, much?

384
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,750
--[growling]
--Fine, snot nose, bring it on!

385
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't throw a fit when you lose!

386
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,833
[SAIKAWA whimpers]
What do I do...?

387
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,750
[KOBAYASHI]
So you picked a fight

388
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,458
and they took you up on it?

389
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,625
[SAIKAWA whines]

390
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,375
How many kids have
agreed to help you out?

391
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,125
About zero.
Saikawa's not very popular.

392
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,875
I know! I'm the worst!

393
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,500
What to do about it...?

394
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,375
I bet you could still
negotiate with them.

395
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,083
No way! I assure you,
they must fight!

396
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,083
Under no circumstances shall
the noble and proud dragon

397
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,500
be taken lightly!

398
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,875
Do you know how to play?

399
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,416
Yes!

400
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I know, as well. I've played
a lot of Explosive Dodgeball.

401
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,416
[KOBAYASHI]
This isn't that kind of game.

402
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,166
Come on, we can do this!

403
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,750
Yeah!

404
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,250
Don't stress.
I'm sure it'll work out.

405
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,375
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm...

406
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,541
What's this, squirt?!
Had to call in friends?!

407
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,000
We're not gonna go
easy on ya, now!

Tohru.

[TOHRU]
Hmm?

413
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:36,958
No killing.

'Kay!

415
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,208
[KOBAYASHI] I knew how
it would end at the start.

416
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,833
From the onset, their
abilities-- Well, their species.

417
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,416
They were on different levels.

418
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,875
This game was above
and beyond one-sided.

419
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,750
[whimpers]

420
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,208
[KOBAYASHI]
It wasn't a win.

421
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,875
It was a massacre.

00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,333
--[TEEN B] Damn it!
--[TEEN A] That's not fair!

423
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,541
You set us up!
You're gonna regret this!

00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,041
[KOBAYASHI]
Oof, "beat up" is not his color.

425
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,166
Kanna, your friends
are incredible!

426
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,916
[KANNA] Hmm. You're right,
they're the worst scum ever.

427
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,250
Not untrue, but you
could be more delicate.

428
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,625
[sighs] I could play
this game all day long.

429
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,000
Well, what a coincidence.
Same here.

430
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,500
Yeah, me three.

431
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,583
[TOHRU] I just remembered...

432
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,000
Now, I might be wrong,

433
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,125
but have I yet to win
against the two of you?

434
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,625
Think today's the day?

435
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,458
Probably... no.

436
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,708
Huh, this could be real bad.

437
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,958
I wanna play!

438
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,125
[SAIKAWA]
Huh?

439
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,041
[KOBAYASHI]
From that moment forward...

440
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,583
...the playground
became a battlefield.

Rah!

--So many dragons.

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Excellent.

446
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,250
[KOBAYASHI] Where did
my peaceful, boring, little life

447
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,750
run off to? Meh, whatever.

448
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,875
[gasps]

449
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,166
[KOBAYASHI]
And that brings us to now.

[sighs]

451
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,166
Don't stress. I'll restore
the playground to normal.

452
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,416
And I'll tweak the memories
of anyone who saw us.

453
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,791
[KOBAYASHI] You're more and
more useful to have around.

454
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,083
[KOBAYASHI] After that,
they took to playing dodgeball

455
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,375
on the regular.

456
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,541
[TOHRU] Pay more attention
to your lower back!

457
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,916
[FAFNIR]
Oh. is this better?

458
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,458
Think "old lady about
to be deserted"!

459
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,916
[KOBAYASHI]
Nailed it again.

[SHIMA]
Look, Kanna!

461
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,208
Isn't it super cute?

00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,875
Oh... Yeah, that's wicked.

Kanna, over here.
These are so cool!

Hello, Saikawa, you're wicked.

Okay! Time to start class, kids.

Oh, yeah, that's wicked.

--[TEACHER A] What's wicked?

What are they talking about?

[SAIKAWA] Kanna, aren't you glad
we won the dodgeball game?

473
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,333
[KANNA]
Yes.

474
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,333
[SAIKAWA] We almost lost our
right to play at the playground!

--[KANNA] That's okay.
--[SAIKAWA gasps]

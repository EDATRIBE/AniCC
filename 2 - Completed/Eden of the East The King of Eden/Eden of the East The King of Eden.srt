1
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,666
Saki, thanks for
believing in me.

2
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,916
Don't forget our travels.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,125
You can always find
me at our special place.

4
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,000
Say, would it be all right

5
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,833
if we pulled over
there for a second?

6
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:06,875
Huh?

7
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,583
That's Grand
Central Staion, right?

8
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,333
Yeah, right. Sure.

9
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,041
Whatever you say,
lady. It's your fare.

10
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,750
Ah, thanks.

11
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,333
I've never seen it
in person before.

12
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,041
I just think it'd be
neat to get a picture.

13
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,125
Tourists.

14
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,833
There ya go. Fifty-five bucks.

15
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,208
Oh, well, I uh...

16
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,041
I really just wanted to
jump out and take a picture,

17
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,208
but if that's not okay--

18
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,000
Free country, lady.
I'll get your bags.

19
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,250
Uh, wow, guess I'm
walking to the hotel...

20
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,875
Jeez.

21
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,083
Shit!

22
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,041
What the fuck is this?!

23
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:12,541
One, two, three,
four, five, six-

24
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:19,083
What's wrong?!

25
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,333
Are you nuts?!

26
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,541
How stupid can you be,

27
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,333
bringing crap like
this into my car? Huh?!

28
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,333
Come back!

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,333
Come back, oh, no.

30
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,583
It's a gun! Quick!

31
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,333
Somebody call the police!

32
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,666
Where did it come from?

33
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,708
Oh, I- uh-

34
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,375
Coming through, excuse me!

35
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,625
What am I supposed
to do with this thing?!

36
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,250
What was that?

37
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,375
What was this doing in my bag?

38
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,750
Oh, great, what now?

39
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,708
My passport, Takky's cell phone,

40
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,708
my purse, they were
all still in the cab.

41
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,916
Takizawa.

42
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,416
Don't worry.
I'll figure this out.

43
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,791
I think I finally
know where to look.

44
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,833
Hey, Saki!

45
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,541
The police finally
finished interrogating me

46
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,166
three days after the missiles
rained down all over Japan.

47
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,791
I decided it was best to go
back to my sister's place,

48
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,583
at least for the time being.

49
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,625
Juiz speaking.
You have one message.

50
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,583
Saki, thanks for
believing in me.

51
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,958
Don't forget our travels.

52
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,333
You can always find me
at our special place.

53
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,333
Takizawa.

54
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,750
I kept to myself,
hiding out at home

55
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,750
until the uproar over
the missile incident

56
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,500
began to die down.

57
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,791
I had a lot of time on my hands.

58
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,541
I spent most of it wondering

59
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,916
about what could have
happened to Takizawa.

60
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,666
But apparently Juiz
had been instructed

61
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,958
to erase any and
all record of his arrest

62
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,958
from police computers.

63
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,333
Takizawa had disappeared
from our world completely.

64
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,291
He was impossible
to find or contact.

65
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,750
You want to become king
of the country, but why?

66
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,833
But a part of him existed still,

67
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,500
in the pictures taken by the
people who were there that day.

68
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,375
He hadn't faded from
everybody's memory.

69
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,541
To some, he would
always be the savior

70
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,375
who had rescued Japan
from the missiles.

71
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,958
When all the pictures
were published

72
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,625
online following the attack,
the mass media reported

73
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,500
that Takizawa was
a central figure

74
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,250
to the terror investigation.

75
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,916
They began searching
for him everywhere.

76
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,458
Meanwhile, because
it was the source

77
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,333
of the Takizawa footage,
the Eden site was flooded

78
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,541
with hits from
all over the world.

79
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:47,000
Incredibly, Eden of the East
became an overnight sensation.

80
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,125
The image of Takizawa directing
the missiles' take-down

81
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,125
became a symbol of revolution.

82
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,875
This picture, combined
with the slogan "Air King,"

83
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,291
drew more and more attention

84
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,875
as the cause
gained wider support.

85
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,041
After the missiles fell,

86
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,250
our country reached a
crucial turning point.

87
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,541
There were miraculously
no casualties,

88
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,166
but things on the domestic front

89
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,250
were still destabilized
and stocks took a nosedive.

90
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,625
After failing to stop
another "Careless Monday,"

91
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,583
the entire administration
was forced to resign.

92
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,541
The event earned the
name "Uncle Dissolution"

93
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,041
in reference to Prime Minister
Eda's strange remark

94
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,458
during the Administration Audit.

95
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,875
All of these crazy events had

96
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,250
a considerably negative effect
on the world economy.

97
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,666
As usual, the U.S.
maintained its policy

98
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,666
of noninvolvement
and stayed out of it.

99
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,833
Our global standing plummeted.

100
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,583
Other nations satirized us

101
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,833
as "the nation that
attempted suicide."

102
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,000
The missiles may have never hit,

103
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,083
but the sad truth
of it is, in the end,

104
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,833
Japan probably took more
damage than if they had.

105
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,833
But there was still
the country's youth.

106
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,916
They knew nothing of
Japan's economic boom

107
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,333
or the subsequent
bursting of the bubble.

108
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,958
This was the first
time they had seen

109
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,583
their problems discussed
on the world stage.

110
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,666
So even though
they were nervous,

111
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,583
this instability represented
momentous opportunities

112
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,375
for improvement.

113
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,875
No one said so aloud,
but after that day,

114
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,250
our vague sense of despair
became a kind of hopefulness,

115
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,291
a feeling that we
could change the country.

116
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,166
Hey, you guys!

117
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,333
It was in this time shadowed

118
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,125
by both fear and optimism,

119
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,416
burdened by
unprecedented crises,

120
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,416
that Eden of the East took the
plunge and went into business.

121
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,291
I offered to help out too,
though I did feel a bit useless.

122
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,083
Nice business card!
So professional!

123
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,208
So you're "Sales
Division Three", huh?

124
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,000
Just because it's
called the third division

125
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,083
doesn't make me the
third-rate, you know.

126
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,541
Kasuga!

127
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,916
A hard worker like me
deserves respect, don't I?

128
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,416
Don't ask me.

129
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,250
This hard worker's already
got a desk on the main floor.

130
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,625
Come on now, Saki.

131
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,625
How desperate can you get?

132
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,583
We'll see you here
tomorrow, Saki!

133
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,041
It was six months
later--that summer--

134
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,416
that things really began moving.

135
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,875
That's when I finally got
the clue I'd been waiting for.

136
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,333
Hey.

137
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,500
You just made a trip to
Washington in May, didn't you?

138
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,875
I saw you bought
a second ticket,

139
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,083
but what I don't get is
why you're going again.

140
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,500
I didn't realize you knew.

141
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:40,583
Why go? Don't you feel like
you belong here with us?

142
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,250
No, that's not it, I just-

143
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,291
Hirasawa, you're being an idiot.

144
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,708
Oh yeah?

145
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,125
Don't worry.

146
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,291
You're not the only one
worried about Takky, you know.

147
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,291
Yeah.

148
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,041
Hirasawa hasn't told you,
but he's up to something, too.

149
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,333
He put Panties
to work monitoring

150
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,708
the activity on
Takky's cell phone.

151
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,208
He set it up so any logs sent

152
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,416
to it are automatically
forwarded to Eden.

153
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,208
As for the other Seleção,

154
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,375
they're still engrossed

155
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,750
in this mysterious
game they're playing.

156
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,375
That could put the whole
country in some hot water.

157
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,666
What if we're hit
by more missiles

158
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,125
or something even worse?

159
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,541
Hold on, don't you think it's
too early?

160
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,791
Isn't it about time that
you told Saki everything?

161
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,333
The reason for this company.

162
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,583
The fact that you founded it

163
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,125
as a support system
to help Takky.

164
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,125
Anyone can see
how much we owe him

165
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,333
for all his help.

166
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,291
So the way I figure it,
this time around,

167
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,875
it's up to us NEETs.

168
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,958
We're the ones who
have to save Takizawa,

169
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,083
and the country as well.

170
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,208
You mean that?

171
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,791
Mhmm. Not that we're
actually NEETs anymore,

172
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,291
but you get the point.

173
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,291
Hey, you guys have
to check this out!

174
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,333
The new Prime Minister's
collapsed!

175
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,791
No way!

176
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,583
Wait a second.

177
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,500
Didn't the name on
Takky's passport change

178
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,541
from Takizawa to Iinuma?

179
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,166
I wonder what Juiz is up to.

180
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,250
I may be wrong,

181
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,291
but I'm starting
to think she's trying

182
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,416
to make him
Prime Minister of Japan.

183
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,708
Look!

184
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,333
"Leak out existence
of illegitimate child?"

185
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,416
So does that mean Takizawa
is the Prime Minister's son?

186
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,458
Uh-uh.

187
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,750
It means she's
trying to make him

188
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,583
the Prime Minister's successor.

189
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,041
Changing his passport like this

190
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,583
was part of her ultimate plan.

191
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,458
This is insane.

192
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,000
I thought he was
a little bit off.

193
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,041
Who asks a computer
to erase his memories

194
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,875
and make him king of a country?

195
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,416
Then after doing so
just randomly disappeared.

196
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,791
But Juiz has lost it
too if she thinks this

197
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,541
is the way to go about
filling the request.

198
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,958
There's still one thing.

199
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,458
Just think for a second.
The chronology's off.

200
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,833
Takky's passport changed
over six months ago,

201
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,333
right after he left.

202
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,250
Does that mean Juiz foresaw
all of this happening?

203
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,583
Who the new
Prime Minister would be,

204
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,458
and the fact that
he would collapse

205
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,833
so early on while in office?

206
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,750
Scary, that means
her power reaches

207
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,416
to the heart of the government.

208
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,875
Never underestimate Saizo Ato.

209
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,250
That's the lesson here.

210
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,416
I knew this would be difficult,

211
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,666
but saving Takizawa
might be impossible.

212
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,458
He's in New York?

213
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:30,583
But I've never been to
New York with Takizawa before.

214
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,875
Didn't the message he left you

215
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,791
say something about
your 'special place'?

216
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,041
Is there anywhere in New York

217
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,833
that he'd think of as
being 'special' to you?

218
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,708
Wait, maybe he-

219
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,791
What, Saki?

220
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,375
Have you got an idea?

221
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,333
Two days later, I was on my way

222
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,958
to the United States,
and New York City.

223
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,500
I believed the
message Takizawa left

224
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,708
about 'our place' was one that

225
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,875
only I would be
able to understand.

226
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,208
So here I am.

227
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,541
But why did everything
have to turn out like this?

228
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,833
Eden of the East?

229
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,250
Saki, why didn't you
think to call us sooner?!

230
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,666
We've all been worried
sick about you.

231
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,333
Sorry.

232
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,041
I've had a lot going on.

233
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,375
It's a good thing
you checked in.

234
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,500
Things have gone from
bad to worse around here.

235
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,791
The Prime Minister passed away,

236
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,125
and there's been more
activity on the phone logs.

237
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,166
Seleção Number 6 and
Number 11 are headed

238
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,000
to New York right now.

239
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,666
And there's still more.

240
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,708
Number 6 made a request to plant
something in your luggage.

241
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,958
Check your bags immediately.

242
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,875
That explains it.

243
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,541
Wait. You mean something's
already happened?

244
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,208
There were handguns
stuffed into my carry-on.

245
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,125
The cab took off with my purse,

246
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,916
and I lost my passport
and the Noblesse phone.

247
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,333
You're kidding me?!

248
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,833
Why didn't you check the
phone as soon as you landed?!

249
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,083
I guess my mind
was somewhere else.

251
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,333
Honestly!

252
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,500
Well, I hate to be the one to
kick you when you're down,

253
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,666
but Seleção Number 2 sent
copies of Takizawa's passport

254
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,375
to all the major networks,

255
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,916
claiming he was the
PM's illegitimate son...

256
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,875
The information's out there now.

257
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,541
Which means the whole
country's in an uproar

258
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,375
about how Iinuma's
son is also wanted

259
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,500
for questioning in
the missile attacks.

260
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,375
They're after him
now more than ever.

261
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:41,041
It looks like the movement
on Takizawa's log

262
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,625
has motivated the Seleção

263
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:46,500
to resume playing
their game in earnest.

264
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,125
All that in just twelve hours?

265
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,666
I'm looking through these

266
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,333
and from Number 11's logs,

267
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,541
I think she's the one
you met in Roppongi,

268
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,875
but Number 6 is still a mystery.

269
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,416
Both of them asked Juiz
for Takky's location

270
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,083
and were denied.

271
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,375
Which means they'll probably try

272
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,250
to make contact with you.

273
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,625
Actually, they might
already be onto you.

274
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,833
Huh?!

275
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,291
Whoever this
Number 6 character is,

276
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,333
how'd they know about Saki?

277
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,458
Probably because the media
was following her around

278
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,375
for awhile after the missiles.

279
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,833
Either that or because she took

280
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,833
Takizawa's Noblesse
phone overseas with her.

281
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,041
That makes sense.

282
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,625
I wish we had
Number 6's identity.

283
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,875
Not knowing creeps me out.

284
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,083
None of us saw this coming,

285
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,750
but we still have
to deal with it.

286
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,625
You need to get to the consulate
general's office at once.

287
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,583
What?! But--

288
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,000
According to our latest reports,

289
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,250
Iinuma's supporters are flocking

290
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,750
to New York to
hunt down Takizawa.

291
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,208
I know you don't
like hearing this,

292
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,041
but I think you need to give up.

293
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,291
No way!

294
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,916
I have to find him, and quickly.

295
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,750
If I don't, the press
is gonna skewer him

296
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,625
when he doesn't even
remember anything.

297
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,416
How many of our burdens has
he already taken on for us?

298
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,041
I think we owe him
at least this much.

299
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,458
Not if it means exposing
you to more danger.

300
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,125
Think about this rationally.

301
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,458
Where are you going to stay?

302
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,375
You can't get a hotel room
without your passport.

303
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,208
No more arguing Saki.

304
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,708
I want you to hang up and
go straight to the consulate.

305
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,083
You got it?

306
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,000
No, Hirasawa.

307
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,708
I came all the way here,

308
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,791
and I'm not leaving
till I do all that I can.

309
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,583
Takizawa left that message
specifically for me,

310
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,333
and I think
I know what it means.

311
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,541
I have to give it a shot.

312
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,333
If I'm right about this,
I have a chance

313
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,750
of reaching him before
the other Seleção do.

314
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,791
I beg you. Just hang
on a little bit longer.

315
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,208
It's a bad idea.

316
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,291
The consulate general
closes at four o'clock.

317
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,625
Please, Hirasawa.

318
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,083
Okay, okay. But you
had better make sure

319
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,708
you're at the consulate
no later than four!

320
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,916
Understood?

321
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Got it, and thank you.

322
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,583
Hey, watch it, lady.

323
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,166
He should be here.

324
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,750
What kind of lame
hero doesn't show up

325
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,458
when the heroine's in trouble?

326
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,375
Maybe if we'd gone with her,

327
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,416
she wouldn't have gotten
herself into this mess.

328
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,416
Are you going to start
crying over spilt milk now?

329
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,666
Besides, I think
she would've found

330
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,083
a way to go alone
no matter what.

331
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,500
I agree.

332
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:37,458
Saki's a big girl and
she can take care of herself.

333
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,625
Have some faith.

334
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,625
Her secret travels
have worked out before.

335
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,333
That's how she met
Takky in the first place.

336
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,875
I guess you're right.

337
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:54,875
I got your voicemail.

338
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:55,500
What's going on?!

339
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,041
Saki's missing?!

340
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,666
Kasuga!

341
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,708
It wasn't me, I swear!

342
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,291
It was me.

343
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,958
I figured he'd just bitch about
it later if we didn't tell him.

344
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:09,083
How could you let
this happen, Hirasawa?!

345
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:13,375
If she gets hurt,
then I am blaming you!

346
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,833
A simple group of NEETs,

347
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:23,375
and this is all it takes to turn
them into crusaders overnight.

348
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:26,125
Am I an awesome
producer or what?

349
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,291
Seems like an entertaining job.

350
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,583
One thing, though.

351
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:33,041
How exactly do you
make money off of it?

352
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,583
Oh, please.

353
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,166
I couldn't care less
about the money.

354
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,458
But you know.

355
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,958
It seems like
Public Security has been

356
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,666
keeping tabs on these
new NEETs of mine.

357
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,791
Level with me.

358
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,583
You wouldn't know
anything about that?

359
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,208
No, beats me.

360
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,625
Of course.

361
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,875
Anyway, it looks as if you've
been playing your cards

362
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,666
as craftily as ever,

363
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,666
for someone who
refuses to join the game.

364
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,750
And what about you?

365
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,041
What change of
heart made you decide

366
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,958
to take this all seriously?

367
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:03,625
You've never been the
slightest bit interested before.

368
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,750
It's Number 9.

369
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,000
I credit him for my inspiration.

370
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,166
Besides which,
if I don't get a move on,

371
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,750
the Supporter will
eliminate me, won't he?

372
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:15,833
I assure you, the Supporter's
task doesn't belong to me.

373
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:19,416
I'm not even sure such
a position actually exists.

374
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,333
But if it does, I would
think he was Number 12.

375
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,916
Well, I hope you
aren't expecting me

376
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,916
to begin trusting you.

377
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,666
You might've made
Number 6 your puppet,

378
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,375
but I have no intention of
letting you do that to me.

379
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,833
I have nothing to
do with it this time.

380
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,958
Sending him after
Number 9 couldn't possibly

381
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:38,000
do anything to benefit me,
so why would I bother?

382
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,291
I don't much care what you
do at this point, anyway.

383
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,833
You've been quite
busy massaging the law,

384
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,750
rubbing elbows with
your politician friends.

385
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,333
But while you were
otherwise occupied,

386
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,500
I found a way to win the game.

387
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:56,166
Did you? How interesting.

388
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,500
Was leaking the identity

389
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,250
of the Prime Minister's son
a part of your plan?

390
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,791
I admit, I've been wondering.

391
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,750
I - won't - tell.

392
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,791
Then we have nothing
more to talk about.

393
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:24,125
We're all done here.

394
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,958
Let's see, next up.

395
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,250
We saw our own Ground Zero.

396
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:15,416
One of the sites where a
missile hit on Careless Monday.

397
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:24,041
Okay, so do I have to ride
that boat to find him?

398
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,833
Good. Safe.

399
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,291
Whatcha doing?

400
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,791
I'm not doing anything!
I was just-

401
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:36,166
You call that nothing? A gun?

402
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,458
Don't worry.

403
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:41,625
Somebody made you
carry it, I'm guessing.

404
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,375
It happens a lot.

405
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:44,750
Gun runners use tourists

406
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,583
so they don't risk
taking the fall. May I?

407
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,958
Now run!

408
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,333
Nice! I don't think
anyone saw us.

409
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,416
Take care, okay?

410
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,333
Takizawa, wait!

411
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:42,333
"Takizawa?" Sorry,
but my name's Iinuma.

412
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,708
Uh. Maybe you could help me.

413
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,666
Mr. Iinuma.
I'm looking for someone.

414
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,000
How can I help you?

415
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,708
Oh, uh, well I think-

416
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:56,666
I have an idea of
where to find him.

417
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,208
Except, I lost all of our things

418
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:01,416
when I first got here,
his cell and my luggage.

419
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,000
Man, that really sucks.

420
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:07,000
I can give you a hand finding
them if you'd like me to.

421
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,166
So where did you last see them?

422
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,875
Back in the yellow cab
I took from the airport.

423
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,500
In a taxi?

424
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,125
That means we
definitely have a chance

425
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,625
of finding them,
so try not to worry.

426
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,833
First off, do you
still have the receipt?

427
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,958
Uh, yeah.

428
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,916
Done!

429
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:36,000
Finally, everyone's
following the script.

430
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,250
It's after three.

431
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,791
Don't you think Saki
should have called by now?

432
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,458
Don't get your panties in a wad.

433
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,000
There's still time left.

434
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,875
But not much though.

435
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,875
Hey, Kasuga, I think
I'm gonna go ahead

436
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,541
and get outta here, alright?

437
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:07,666
You're scheduled
for four more hours.

438
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,833
You can't just leave in the
middle of your shift like that.

439
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,833
It's not like there's
a lot going on.

440
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:15,750
Besides, you guys are still
here, so what's the big deal?

441
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,958
Whether we're here or
not isn't the point.

442
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,750
Let it go, Kasuga!

443
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,333
You can head out.

444
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,833
Have a good night.
Get some rest.

445
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,416
Thanks. See ya later!

446
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,208
Goodnight, you guys!

447
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,416
Kasuga's got the life.

448
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,583
Treated like an exec just

449
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:32,500
'cause he went to
Mr. Hirasawa's school.

450
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:33,708
Yeah, no kidding.

451
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,625
Must be nice, huh.

452
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,041
Kasuga.

453
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,791
They're older than me,

454
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,208
so I get why they don't
call me "Mr." like Hirasawa,

455
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,833
but that isn't it.
They come in late.

456
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:49,916
They won't work the night shift.

457
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,458
They all want raises.

458
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,250
They don't understand
what it takes

459
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,625
to be an adult
in the work place.

460
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:58,333
I know.

461
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:01,541
We have a bunch of lazy,
good-for-nothing employees.

462
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,833
Well, maybe we should
just clean house

463
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:04,958
and get rid of them all.

464
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:06,500
Huh?!

465
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,833
I get your point.

466
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:09,708
I shouldn't be complaining

467
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,833
about having people to help me.

468
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:14,833
I do understand how you feel.

469
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,125
The old guys who take success

470
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,208
for granted should be the enemy.

471
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,458
But I get what they
feel like now, too.

472
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:21,583
And that's what it means

473
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:24,250
to be a full-fledged
member of society.

474
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:31,541
Hard at work stuffing
your faces, huh?

475
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,250
I hope you haven't lost
your NEET spirit already.

476
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:35,708
You can't lose your drive

477
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,375
just because you've
gone into business.

478
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,000
Seriously, you
don't want to give in

479
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:42,500
to the man like all the other
lame adults out there, do you?

480
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,125
Yeah, exactly!

481
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,166
Oh, hey there, Kasuga.

482
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,291
What's up? How's
it hangin'? Micchon.

483
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,916
What's this thing?

484
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,958
I took the liberty of amping up
Eden's search engine for ya.

485
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,458
That little baby's
a real piece of work.

486
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,541
It'll give us free access

487
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,958
to data we could
never access before.

488
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,625
There's gotta be pre-Takizawa
info lyin' around somewhere,

489
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:08,166
stuff from before he
was playing this game.

490
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,166
Let's find out a bit more
about Vintage Boy's past.

491
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,166
Once we do that, we can
stop people from thinking

492
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,791
he's Prime Minister
Iinuma's son or whatever.

493
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,125
Right!

494
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:48,541
Um, did I take you
away from your job?

495
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,208
Don't worry.

496
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:52,583
I was just on my way to
a party for a coworker.

497
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:55,125
Oh. Okay.

498
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,125
Hey, cheer up.

499
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,625
We're gonna find
your bags, 'kay?

500
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,541
Then you can catch up

501
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:04,666
with the person you
were looking for.

502
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,750
That Takizawa guy.

503
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,041
Yeah.

504
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,166
So, who is he?

505
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,541
An old boyfriend or something?

506
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:11,916
Oh, no! That's not it.

507
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,750
Takizawa, he was a
good friend of mine.

508
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:20,375
Six months ago he
disappeared into thin air.

509
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,541
I eventually found out

510
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,833
that he was living
here in New York City.

511
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,083
But even though we were close,

512
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:28,041
I don't think he's going
to remember me at all.

513
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,541
Wow, that's harsh.

514
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:33,083
Yeah, no kidding. It's rough.

515
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,291
Follow me.

516
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,916
I found out who
your taxi driver was.

517
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,333
That's him there!

518
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,708
Uh-oh. He looks kinda scary.

519
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,708
There. Stay just
like that for me, okay?

520
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,541
Hi!

521
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,208
Do you happen to
know if anybody left

522
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:40,041
a cell phone in your cab
earlier today? Or a bag?

523
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,083
I don't know nothin', pal.

524
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,625
You sure about that?

525
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:51,041
See, I'm a police
officer, from Japan.

526
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,333
You're a cop?

527
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:56,916
Do you recognize that
young lady over there, sir?

528
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,375
She may not look it, but she
is a dangerous terrorist.

529
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,458
She's a terrorist?

530
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,541
Yes! I finally
managed to catch her.

531
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:13,791
But I'm still looking for the
bomb that she was carrying.

532
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:18,666
Did you hear me? B-O-M-B. Bomb!

533
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,166
A bomb?

534
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,666
Apparently it's been cleverly
disguised as a cell phone.

535
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,750
If I don't find it, things
are gonna get ugly quick.

536
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,458
It's really important that you
help me out here, or KABOOM!

537
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:31,458
You know?

538
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:34,666
Well, uh-

539
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,625
Maybe I've got the
wrong place then.

540
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:40,791
I'll keep asking around.
See ya. Have a good day.

541
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,041
Hey, hey, hey. Wait up a second.

542
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,375
Is this the purse
that you're looking for?

543
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:55,291
Yep, it's here.

544
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm just glad we
found it in time.

545
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,833
Yeah, me too.
That was a close call.

546
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:02,458
Thanks for your
cooperation, sir!

547
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,458
I got it!

548
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,291
Wow, he didn't look
like he wanted to help.

549
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,333
Keep up the good work, man!

550
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:10,416
He was all right.

551
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,291
I just needed to
explain the situation.

552
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,833
'Kay. Here.

553
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:19,916
Oh, and I'd avoid
taking another cab back

554
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,750
to the airport if
I were you, just to be safe.

555
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:23,666
So long.

556
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,791
Please hold on.

557
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,791
Is there something else?

558
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,083
Um, yeah.

559
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:32,541
Remember earlier,
when I told you

560
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,291
about the guy
I'd been looking for?

561
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,500
I meant you!

562
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,000
I've been looking for you.

563
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:42,666
Good one! You were
looking for me?

564
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,583
I'm flattered but-

565
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,333
Is that me?

566
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,166
I've been looking for you

567
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,166
for six months straight--ever
since you disappeared.

568
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:20,000
What d'ya say, my place?

569
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,125
Huh?

570
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,291
Freak out all you'd like,

571
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:36,083
but it's not going
to accomplish anything.

572
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:39,291
Yeah, but she's late!

573
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:46,083
Hey. Saki sent an email.

574
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:48,916
She says "I found Takizawa." 

575
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,291
With his help, I was able

576
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,833
to get my passport and
the cell phone back, too.

577
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,958
So is she coming to his rescue,
or is he coming to hers?

578
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,916
What I'd like to know
is how she found him.

579
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,583
Oh, isn't it obvious?

580
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:05,041
Love brought them
together, what else?

581
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:09,541
Is there more?

582
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,750
"For now we're headed
back to his apartment.

583
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,541
I'll write more when
I have time." That's it.

584
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,333
This is so exciting. Right?

585
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,458
Well, perhaps somebody
should respond to Saki's email

586
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:27,250
and remind her to
use good judgment.

587
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:30,875
Saki! No! You can't do this!

588
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,250
You can't do anything
about it now, Osugi.

589
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,166
It's time to accept the facts
and move on with your life.

590
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,500
I'm ashamed of you.

591
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,125
You must remember what
the NEET youth stand for.

592
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,958
We don't roll over and
give in to the status quo.

593
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,208
It's our solemn duty

594
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:46,541
to help Osugi fight
for what he believes.

595
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,041
Am I right, Micchon?

596
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,625
I don't think so.

597
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:24,250
Yes. Juiz here.

598
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,583
Did you see to it that she
got safely away this morning?

599
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,166
Yes.

600
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,666
I caused a minor car accident
to distract the police from her.

601
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,458
I generally prefer more elegant
methods, but time was short.

602
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,750
I understand.

603
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,916
It was outside
the effective range.

604
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,875
You did what you could.

605
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,583
You're too kind.

606
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,583
Will there be
anything else for now?

607
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:49,625
No, no. I think that should
be all, but thank you.

608
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:51,708
Very well.

609
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:53,125
What's wrong?

610
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:54,708
It's just that we
haven't followed

611
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:57,041
our usual routine lately.

612
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,458
That's true.

613
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:05,250
I haven't set my blade to a
man's Johnny in quite awhile.

614
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,583
Is it me?

615
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,833
Have I done something
to disappoint you?

616
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,750
No, Juiz. It's not you.

617
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:13,833
I have other business I need
to attend to at the moment.

618
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,833
May I ask what?

619
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,458
This is Number 1,
Daiju Mononobe.

620
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:32,000
This smarmy, preppy, four-eyed
jerk is the Seleção who hit me.

621
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,875
He left his position
in the bureaucracy

622
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,833
and got an executive job
with Ato and Company.

623
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:39,458
His objective was to
become the new Mr. Outside,

624
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,000
but he botched the plan.

625
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:43,625
No idea what he's
been up to since.

626
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,625
We don't know who Number 2 is.

627
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:48,000
His requests tend
toward the criminal side,

628
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,666
but he's kept his
identity well hidden.

629
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,291
Number 6 is sneakin'
around New York right now.

630
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:54,958
We don't know
his identity either,

631
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,416
but from his requests,

632
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,375
I'd guess he's some kinda
film producer or somethin'.

633
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,625
In short.

634
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,541
I think we need to view
these three as a threat.

635
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,458
I doubt that they've got
anything good in mind

636
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,000
for ol' Vintage Boy.

637
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,958
And Number 10,
Ryo Yuki, it looks like

638
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:10,750
he's moved from the 'danger'
list onto the 'drop-out' list'.

639
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,083
Yeah.

640
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,958
His behavior changed
after the missile incident.

641
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,541
He's been makin'
requests to have Number 9

642
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:19,000
assassinated over and over
but been denied every time.

643
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,833
Three days ago, his phone
finally went completely dark.

644
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:22,916
That sounds like the same thing

645
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,708
that happened to Number 4.

646
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:28,000
Yep. No telling yet
whether he's dead or alive.

647
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,583
Number 10 had money
left in his account though,

648
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:31,958
just like Number 4 did.

649
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:33,333
So it's possible someone decided

650
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,958
that he wasn't worth
havin' around anymore.

651
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:38,666
Somebody else's got
me wondern', though.

652
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,750
It's Number 5, Hajime Hiura.

653
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,000
Dude's completely broke.

654
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,541
There's not a cent
left in his account,

655
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,583
but somehow, he's still alive.

656
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,000
I went to see him
to check on his status

657
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,291
and what-not,
but he wasn't runnin'

658
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:54,375
that hospital of his anymore.

659
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:55,583
And you know why?

660
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:57,708
'Cause he'd lost
all his memories.

661
00:41:57,791 --> 00:42:00,625
Even when I reminded him
he owned a huge hospital,

662
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,083
he had no clue what
I was talkin' about.

663
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:06,375
He was pretty rattled when
I explained the situation,

664
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,250
but the old man
caught on a lot faster

665
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,166
than I would've expected.

666
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,125
It was weird.

667
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:14,541
When he realized he really
did build a hospital,

668
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:17,875
he just accepted it, like it
was meant to be or somethin'.

669
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:19,750
Even with all his
memories wiped out,

670
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,166
it seems like
he'd still rather look

671
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,125
at the positive side of things.

672
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,250
If his money's gone,

673
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,333
why do you think he
hasn't been killed

674
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:26,750
by the Supporter yet?

675
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,041
These guys don't mess around.

676
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,708
There's some reason
he's still alive,

677
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:32,166
and the only thing I can
think of is that he won.

678
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,291
But remember what
happens if somebody wins?

679
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,708
The other Seleção are
supposed to be eliminated.

680
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:38,583
It doesn't make sense.

681
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:39,791
You've got a point there.

682
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:41,833
But maybe we've been
looking at all of this

683
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:43,250
from the wrong angle-Have
you ever considered

684
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,125
that Mr. Outside means to
eliminate their memories,

685
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,041
not their actual lives?

686
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,625
Perhaps. Interesting theory,

687
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:51,666
but, he said any Seleção who
broke the rules would die.

688
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,125
There're still tons
of uncertainties.

689
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,291
Like, what if Mr. Outside

690
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,083
and Number 12
are the same person?

691
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:57,500
That'd change up the
entire game, wouldn't it?

692
00:42:57,583 --> 00:43:00,458
One guy keeping tabs
on the other Seleção,

693
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:01,791
makin' them play by the rules,

694
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,833
and dishin' out
penalties all by himself.

695
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,416
He'd be running around like a
chicken with its head cut off.

696
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,416
But Juiz would help.

697
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,750
That's what she's there for.

698
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,000
Nope. I didn't find anything

699
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,041
in the logs that
pointed to that.

700
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:13,416
He's the one who
organized the game

701
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,375
in the first place,
so maybe he's been outside

702
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,041
the rules from the beginning.

703
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,416
If so, then why would he leave

704
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,416
a record of transportin' Juiz?

705
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,708
If you ask me, old
Saizo Ato's gone batty,

706
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:25,500
but he's still run a consistent,
streamlined game so far.

707
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:26,708
The geezer really seems

708
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:28,833
to know what he's doing,
even if it is nuts.

709
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,000
Think about it.

710
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,500
He's got this
crazy idea that no one

711
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:33,875
in their right mind would
willingly go along with.

712
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,666
So, in order to motivate 'em,

713
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,166
he invents the
role of the Supporter,

714
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,666
and he makes them all think
it's a life-or-death game.

715
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,125
Which also increases their
suspicion of each other,

716
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:44,625
like when they thought
Takizawa was the Supporter.

717
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,500
Of course, it could be nothin'
but wishful thinkin' on my part.

718
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,125
Well, it'd be
good news for Takky.

719
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:50,750
He's burning through
his balance quickly.

720
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:52,666
I don't know how long
it'll last at this rate.

721
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,166
We shouldn't jump to any
conclusions yet, though.

722
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,500
She's right.

723
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,583
We've gotta be careful
not to get too optimistic.

724
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,875
Huh, so I'm in this
group called the Seleção,

725
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:26,458
my code name is Number 9,
and I'm wanted for questioning

726
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:29,125
about that big
Japanese missile crisis.

727
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:32,875
It's kinda like that movie,
The Man Who Stole the Sun.

728
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:36,291
It's not a movie!
It's true, I swear!

729
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:39,875
Hey, don't worry; I never
said I didn't believe you.

730
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:45,416
Well, this is our stop.

731
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,166
A hotel?

732
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,583
Heeeeyyyy! Air King!

733
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:57,666
Hey there!

734
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:06,000
That happen a lot?

735
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,500
People calling you 'Air King'?

736
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,083
Yep.

737
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:10,875
People I don't even know walk
right up to me on the street.

738
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,416
That's part of the
reason I didn't just

739
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,458
blow off your story, no
matter how weird it was.

740
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:16,791
It might be true.

741
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:19,291
Without my memories,
how can I say that it's not?

742
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:21,583
Hell. Just looking
at this picture

743
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:24,583
makes me believe
I'm the real thing.

744
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:31,333
All right, they're in
room 801 of the Gramercy Hotel.

745
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,916
I don't care what
you have to do...

746
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,500
just make them take a shower,
then do exactly what I told you.

747
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:37,541
I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid I don't understand

748
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:39,208
the point of your request.

749
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:41,583
Come on. Think about it.

750
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:44,250
In every great movie
featuring a couple on the run

751
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,500
from the authorities,
the two lovebirds inevitable

752
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,541
end up in the
shower at some point.

753
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:51,666
It's a classic motif that
I can't simply overlook.

754
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,041
Classic motif or not,
not even something

755
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:55,958
as powerful as
the Seleção system

756
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:57,916
can control the human will.

757
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,208
Besides which, you're at the
edge of the effective range.

758
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,041
My scope is limited.

759
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:05,000
No, no, no!
Hold on a sec. Not fair!

760
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,916
I know for a fact
you're supplying Number 9

761
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,375
with cash from a bank
account that you created.

762
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:12,041
That's totally against
the rules, and you know it.

763
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:13,208
If you're doing it for him,

764
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:15,125
why can't you bend
the rules for me, too?!

765
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:16,791
That's different.

766
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,416
It's part of Number 9's
request to become king.

767
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,541
As such, it is perfectly
in keeping with the rules.

768
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,750
Oh, all right. I get it now.

769
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,833
Then I want you to
make me a king, too!

770
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:28,208
The process of becoming a king

771
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:30,208
is different for each Seleção.

772
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:33,041
You may not be eligible.

773
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:36,125
Please wait while I confirm
if your request is possible.

774
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:37,333
This may take a moment.

775
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:39,208
Do you really have
to be so difficult?!

776
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,083
Will that be all?

777
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,958
Fine, then just
do what I told ya to

778
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,666
in the first fuckin' place!
Can you handle that?!

779
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,958
Accepted. I pray that
you become a savior

780
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:51,708
who knows how to
watch his mouth better.

781
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:59,958
Damn her; she's becoming
more of a smart-ass every day.

782
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,208
Nice room, Mr. Iinuma!

783
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:11,916
How did you pay for all this?

784
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,958
Wasn't me.

785
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,916
Oh, and feel free to call me
Takizawa if you'd prefer.

786
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:20,500
So do you remember
anything that's happened

787
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:22,958
since all your
memories disappeared?

788
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,125
It was strange.

789
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,791
The cops up and
released me outta nowhere.

790
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,583
They gave me business cards

791
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:31,333
and a passport in Iinuma's
name and all these keys.

792
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:32,541
Then I got a phone call.

793
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,541
It instructed me to
go to the movie theater

794
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,458
where I first saw Dumbo.

795
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:39,375
So I came to New York
and found the theater.

796
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:42,291
I've been waiting ever
since for my mom to show up.

797
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:43,458
You're doing what?!

798
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:44,875
People usually go to see Dumbo

799
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,625
with their mom's, don't they?

800
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:50,333
So I figured that random call
I got probably came from her.

801
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:52,666
But after everything you
told me, I'm not sure.

802
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,791
I mean, didn't you say I haven't
seen her since I was five?

803
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:57,666
Mhmm.

804
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,208
I guess that "concierge"
lady on the phone

805
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:03,458
is taking care of
this room for me.

806
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:04,458
But I don't remember seeing

807
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,541
a request for a
room on your log.

808
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:08,375
Really?

809
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:15,958
"Given the situation,

810
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:17,583
it's too dangerous
to come back yet."

811
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:19,833
"You and Takizawa
hide out in the U.S.

812
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:21,583
until the dust settles.

813
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,250
We'll back you up from here.

814
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,833
Wait for us to call
before you move."

815
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:27,375
What do they mean by that?

816
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,916
Your request to become king
is complicating things a bit.

817
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,291
There's no way you can go
home without being noticed.

818
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,875
You'll not only be the Prime
Minister's illegitimate son,

819
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:37,166
but the main suspect
in the missile attack!

820
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,708
Hey, here's an idea.

821
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,666
Why don't I see if
I can cancel that request?

822
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,500
It's gotta be
worth a try, right?

823
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:43,875
Huh?!

824
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,083
Hello, Juiz speaking.

825
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:48,083
Yeah, hello?

826
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,583
It's been such a long time!

827
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:51,666
I haven't heard
from you since I called

828
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,041
the police station while
I was having you released.

829
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:56,291
Oh! So that was you.

830
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:59,291
Funny story: I actually
thought that you were my mom.

831
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:01,375
Since you're back in touch,'

832
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:03,000
I take it everything's
been going well

833
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:04,583
these past few months?

834
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:05,833
That's good to hear!

835
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:06,708
Yeah, well.

836
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:09,291
Uh. I had a question about that.

837
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,416
I was wondering if
it would be possible

838
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,250
to cancel that request
to become king.

839
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,500
What?

840
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:18,333
But I thought you'd make
such a splendid king!

841
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:19,583
I must admit,

842
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,583
I'm a bit disappointed
about this, Number 9.

843
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:22,375
Wow.

844
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:23,791
Thank you, I guess.

845
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:26,583
It is technically possible
to cancel the order,

846
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:27,958
but if you choose to do so,

847
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:30,791
things will remain-
as they are- at present.

848
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:33,000
Do you still wish to proceed
with the cancellation?

849
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,416
Nothing'll change?

850
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,625
That isn't going to help anyone.

851
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,208
Even if it doesn't, I still
think you should cancel it.

852
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,375
Can I have a little
time to think it over?

853
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:46,375
Huh?

854
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:49,458
Yes, of course. Noblesse oblige.

855
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:50,750
I pray that you continue

856
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:55,125
to be a successful prince,
er, rather, savior.

857
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,291
Why not cancel?

858
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:58,500
Well, I figure
I've come this far,

859
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:00,791
so I should probably
see it through.

860
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,875
You sure? Really?

861
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,791
I can't really
blame Mrs. Iinuma.

862
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:17,375
I'd feel the same
way in her position.

863
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:29,125
Dear. As expected,
yet another unusual request

864
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:32,875
from Number 6.

865
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:39,833
I wonder if Number 9
knows what he's up to.

866
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,750
We don't have to eat that stuff.

867
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:48,333
We do have other food, you know.

868
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:50,041
What happened to
your NEET spirit?

869
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:53,416
Life isn't all about fancy food
and nice things, you know.

870
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,666
This from you?

871
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,416
The same guy who could
barely leave his house

872
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,708
for two years
because he was living

873
00:50:57,791 --> 00:50:59,916
on an allowance he
got from his parents.

874
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,125
Don't you get it, man?

875
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:03,375
That's what being
a NEET is about.

876
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,166
That's easy for you to say.

877
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,750
You've had a good time
of it as a NEET

878
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,916
so far since your
parents are well off,

879
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,541
but that isn't gonna
last much longer.

880
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:17,375
It sounds like the changes in
the tax laws are going through.

881
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:19,958
Like the one that's gonna push

882
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:22,333
the death tax up
to a hundred percent?

883
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,333
This country gets threatened
with a missile attack,

884
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,708
and we're the ones
who end up payin'.

885
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:27,958
It's nuts.

886
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,833
How can such a crazy law
possibly pass so easily?

887
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:32,583
The youth don't
take it seriously

888
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,208
since they have
nothing to pass on.

889
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,750
Instead, they see it as a way
of leveling the playing field

890
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:39,875
by taxing the rich, but most
older folks have already started

891
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:43,208
depleting their savings
so they can avoid the tax.

892
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:44,250
Yeah, it's true.

893
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,208
Even my old man's doing it.

894
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:47,416
He intends to make damn sure

895
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,500
that he's not
leaving me anything.

896
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:52,166
The law's supporters
say it'll be a stimulus

897
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,333
to speed up the
economy's recovery.

898
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,625
But if you ask me, what
they're really trying to do

899
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:59,333
is stick it to the NEETs,
and from the sound of it,

900
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,958
Hirasawa, your father is
playing right into their plans.

901
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:04,541
A stimulus? Oh, please!

902
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:07,083
What they're doing is
stealing the taxpayers' money.

903
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,666
Why can't the government
get anything right?

904
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:15,000
Hey, check your phone.

905
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:17,166
I don't think you hung
up after the last call.

906
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,208
That doesn't make sense.

907
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:20,333
I'll get it for you.

908
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,625
Looks like Number 6
just made a move.

909
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:45,458
That's hot! Why did
this thing turn itself on?

910
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:54,333
Yes, hello?

911
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,333
Number 9?

912
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,583
Who's asking for 'im?

913
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:02,000
You really don't
remember me, do you?

914
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:02,708
Huh?

915
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:04,083
Well.

916
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:06,041
I only called to see if you
were in the shower yet.

917
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:09,375
What? That came out of nowhere.

918
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,625
A 'yes' or 'no' will do.

919
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:16,000
Okay. No, not at the moment.

920
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:19,083
I suggest you check your
cell phone immediately.

921
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,541
Who's that?

922
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:26,125
Beats me.

923
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:38,000
That's good stuff.

924
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:41,250
Small explosions always
play more realistic on film.

925
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:44,541
This is right up there
with Spielberg's Munich.

926
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:55,791
No way!
They got out of the building?!

927
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:58,875
Juiz, what the hell?!

928
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:00,916
I told you! All great
movies have a sce---

929
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,333
My research hasn't turned
up a single classic movie

930
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:06,083
that ends with the leads
being blown up in a bathroom.

931
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:10,291
That was my own
personal touch, thank you.

932
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,000
Fine, I'll let it
slide this time,

933
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,041
just get them for me, will ya?

934
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,458
Request denied.

935
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,291
You're outside
the effective range.

936
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:19,583
I cannot pursue them
in a timely manner.

937
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,833
Why, you little-

938
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,208
Yeah. Don't worry. We're fine.

939
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:34,125
Someone warned Takizawa
about the bomb,

940
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:37,041
and we were able to get out
of the building just in time.

941
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:39,500
A warning? Who'd it come from?

942
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:41,750
I have no idea.

943
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:44,708
In any case, we'll
come up with a way

944
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:46,958
to wire you some money tomorrow.

945
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:48,875
Take it and then
get out of New York.

946
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:50,458
Right, thank you.

947
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,625
So what now?

948
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:53,708
Do you have a place
to hide until then?

949
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:54,583
We're headed for the place

950
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,583
where Takizawa works right now.

951
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:58,333
He says he has a key.

952
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:31,083
So, this is the theater where
I saw Dumbo the first time.

953
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:32,875
That wasn't a lot to go on.

954
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:34,875
But you still found it.

955
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,791
Crazy, huh. Here, take this.

956
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,541
They always crank the
AC up way too high in here.

957
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:41,875
But what about you?

958
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,166
I'm gonna keep watch.

959
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,916
It'd be bad news
if someone finds us.

960
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,833
Shout if you need
anything, okay?

961
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:48,375
Hold on!

962
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:54,916
Are you gonna leave again?

963
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:06,416
Hey. Do you know
what I was doing

964
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,458
out in Brooklyn today?

965
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:09,833
No. What?

966
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:11,708
I've lost almost all
of my memories,

967
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:14,666
except for the ones that're
associated with movies.

968
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,458
For some reason those stuck.

969
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:19,333
That's probably why I was
able to find this place.

970
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:22,083
But there's this one,
a movie I can't seem

971
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:24,041
to remember no
matter how hard I try.

972
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:25,250
It's about this couple that gets

973
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,291
temporarily separated
from each other,

974
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:29,083
but they took a picture of
themselves in the middle

975
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:32,083
of 9/11 with Ground Zero
in the background.

976
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:33,541
That picture becomes the clue

977
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:37,125
that ultimately brings
them back together.

978
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,541
I was so desperate to remember

979
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:42,541
the movie's title that I
visited Ground Zero every day,

980
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:43,916
but now you're here,

981
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,250
and it turns out it wasn't
a scene from a movie.

982
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,625
Wow, you mean you
can actually hack into

983
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:18,875
all those peoples'
personal networks?

984
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:20,541
Shouldn't you
be careful snooping

985
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:22,000
into business
and school records?

986
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:23,500
That'll get you in big trouble.

987
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,875
Little late to be
worrying about that now.

988
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:26,916
We're runnin' outa time.

989
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,958
We need all the information

990
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:30,166
that we can get
on him, and quickly.

991
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,875
Hey, I found something!

992
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:42,083
Now I get why we
couldn't find his data.

993
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,958
Damn Juiz. This is her work.

994
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:47,166
She's erasing all of the "Akira
Takizawa" info on the net,

995
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,291
and replacing it with
"Akira Iinuma."

996
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:51,500
Hey, Micchon!

997
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:53,791
Did Number 9 send out
that order himself?

998
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:56,291
It doesn't say anything
like that in the logs.

999
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:00,083
It's gone?!

1000
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,333
So she's erasing more

1001
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:03,458
than Akira Takizawa's
history on the internet.

1002
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,750
She's also deleting all
the names in his log.

1003
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:07,041
That's crazy!

1004
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:08,958
You mean Juiz has been
making data disappear

1005
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:11,416
all this time and
we haven't noticed it?

1006
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,208
Eh, don't have a heart attack.

1007
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:16,333
I made a plan B in case
this kinda thing happened.

1008
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:17,833
I worked it out so
the phone's activity

1009
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:20,875
is copied to my PC,
where it's saved.

1010
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:22,291
You are so awesome!

1011
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:26,166
Aw, stop it.
You're making me blush!

1012
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:30,791
 Impossible!

1013
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:33,125
A firewall that's got
the ability to attack?

1014
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:36,375
What is this? You ever
seen anything like it?

1015
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:40,916
Micchon, try scrolling back
through Takky's detail log.

1016
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,916
Stop right there. Look.

1017
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,375
 Yeah, I see it.

1018
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:48,541
"Hack into Eden of the East
and use the image system."

1019
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,375
Your plan backfired, Panties!

1020
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:52,625
Now Juiz can use Eden
for her own purposes

1021
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,458
since you beefed up
the search engine!

1022
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:57,416
She's usin' it?! That bitch!

1023
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,875
At this rate, it won't be long

1024
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:02,458
before Akira Iinuma replaces
Akira Takizawa completely.

1025
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:29,875
They're called roving bugs.

1026
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:32,333
They're used to control
cell phones remotely.

1027
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:35,666
With these, you can listen in
on surrounding conversations.

1028
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,208
From what I hear, FBI types
use these things all the time.

1029
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:41,291
Is a Seleção behind this?

1030
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:44,916
No clue. What do you think?

1031
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,541
Is it one of them, Micchon?

1032
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:49,125
Probably. It's here,
in Number 1's log.

1033
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:52,625
"Have Public Security Division
investigate Eden of the East."

1034
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:54,666
It's four-eyes again?!

1035
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:57,625
What is he up to this time?

1036
00:59:57,708 --> 01:00:00,333
And what does it
have to do with Eden?

1037
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,583
Takizawa?!

1038
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,000
Hey, what's wrong?

1039
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:34,333
Don't tell me you thought
I'd taken off again.

1040
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,458
I know this poster.

1041
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:49,458
You had it hanging up
in your theater, too.

1042
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:51,625
I guess it musta been
really important to me

1043
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:54,708
at some point for it to keep
on popping up like that.

1044
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,041
So, what now?

1045
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:00,791
I'm betting it's still
gonna be quite a while

1046
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:03,333
before the money comes
in from your friends.

1047
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:06,750
I've got enough cash for us
to take the bus to Chinatown.

1048
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:08,250
I have an idea.

1049
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:10,625
Why don't we take a walk
and explore the city?

1050
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,916
Wait, explore?

1051
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,083
Why not?

1052
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:14,791
This neighborhood
is familiar to me,

1053
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,875
like I lived here as
a kid or something.

1054
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:18,916
Plus, there are still some
things I need to know.

1055
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,958
Some things about my past.

1056
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:26,000
I want proof of who I was
before he's gone for good.

1057
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,708
Well I can think of one thing.

1058
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:30,000
Before you left,
you said something odd

1059
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,416
about there being
no "gold ring."

1060
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,375
I think that's where
we should start.

1061
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,750
Juiz speaking.

1062
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,500
Yo, No-obli.

1063
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:46,125
I'm up to something interesting.

1064
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,375
You wanna hear?

1065
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:49,041
Certainly. I'd love to.

1066
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,458
How's this headline:

1067
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:53,041
"Late Prime Minister's Son
is the Missile Terrorist."

1068
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,166
That should cause a good amount
of chaos, don't you think?

1069
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:59,416
Unfortunately, it won't be
enough to save the country.

1070
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,375
To do that, we're gonna
have to go further.

1071
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:02,500
We find a way to make

1072
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:04,541
all Japan's citizens
feel victimized.

1073
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,041
They need to be
motivated to stand up

1074
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:08,041
and bitch at other nations.

1075
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:10,125
Are you feeling me, Juiz?

1076
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:12,500
Yes, I feel you, 2G.

1077
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:15,166
These days, the victim's
the one with all the power.

1078
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,958
Think about it: We live in a
time where all you have to do

1079
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:19,500
is spill coffee on yourself

1080
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:21,791
and you can sue
for pain and suffering.

1081
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:24,041
So I say we buy us one
of those victim tickets

1082
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:26,291
and hop on the train
with the rest of 'em.

1083
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,208
I'd hate to waste
the NEETs' sit-in.

1084
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:31,041
Let's orchestrate a nice,
painless destruction.

1085
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:33,791
Magnificent, 2G! Truly inspired.

1086
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,875
I know, right?

1087
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:40,208
The Prime Minister's son returns
to Japan in an Air King T-shirt.

1088
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:42,083
The rest of Asia
promptly flips out

1089
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:43,583
because they're
afraid that we're going

1090
01:02:43,666 --> 01:02:45,958
to turn militaristic
and nuke them.

1091
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:47,458
Then the Air King is gunned down

1092
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:49,750
by a foreigner shortly
after returning home,

1093
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,083
and from there,
it's a done deal.

1094
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:53,625
Yes, 2G.

1095
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:57,416
I pray you shall always remain
a forward-thinking savior.

1096
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:01,750
But how do we get him
to wear the T-shirt?

1097
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:26,500
It's over there,
on the merry-go-round.

1098
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:29,041
I think that's the gold ring
you were talking about.

1099
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:33,041
I didn't know what you meant,
so I did some research.

1100
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:35,958
Japanese merry-go-rounds
don't have gold rings.

1101
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:39,541
That's what you noticed on the
day of the last missile attack.

1102
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:41,625
Apparently most of
the ones in the U.S.

1103
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:43,541
don't have them anymore, either.

1104
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,916
They did up until
around the late eighties,

1105
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,166
though, and sometimes,
you'll still find one.

1106
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:54,916
You're supposed to
try to grab the ring.

1107
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,791
If you catch it, you get an
extra ride on the carousel.

1108
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:07,750
That makes sense.

1109
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:10,375
I must've been here
sometime as a kid.

1110
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:12,875
That explains why I know
about the gold ring.

1111
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:20,666
That was a nice try.

1112
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:32,833
It's over already?

1113
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:33,833
That was quick.

1114
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,166
You take another spin.

1115
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,208
I'll watch you ride
from right over there.

1116
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,708
When did you get that?!

1117
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:52,041
This place does
bring back memories.

1118
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:53,208
Mom was always sending me off

1119
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:56,375
to the theater to
watch shows by myself.

1120
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,375
So when she actually
took me somewhere else,

1121
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:01,500
like this park, I was ecstatic.

1122
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:03,791
I'd reach for that gold ring
with everything I had,

1123
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:07,375
hoping I'd never have to
get off the merry-go-round.

1124
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:09,750
And when I caught it,
I'd wave to her and shout,

1125
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:13,166
"Look, Mom, I did it!
I got the gold ring!"

1126
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,500
She'd be sitting here,

1127
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,541
just watching me go
'round and 'round again.

1128
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:26,583
She hated movies.

1129
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:30,291
There was only one she'd
ever watch with me: Dumbo.

1130
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,625
You should come out of the rain.

1131
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:37,250
You're gonna get soaked!

1132
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,541
Don't worry about it.

1133
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:41,458
I'd rather watch you
from here, if that's okay.

1134
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:47,833
Target sighted.

1135
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:49,916
He's in front of the carousel.

1136
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,208
I finally got 'em.

1137
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:01,750
They better not have
gotten too friendly

1138
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,083
while I wasn't
there to film them.

1139
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:16,791
Hey, what's this?

1140
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,250
Thanks to you I was
able to get back some of

1141
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:25,125
my memories from the
time I spent in New York.

1142
01:06:50,041 --> 01:06:51,708
Hurry up. Get in!

1143
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,250
You're the one
who called to warn me

1144
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:16,291
about the bomb yesterday?

1145
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:18,750
Yes. Prime Minister Iinuma's
wife wanted me

1146
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:19,958
to fetch you.

1147
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:23,291
She insisted I use
the utmost secrecy.

1148
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,458
The other Seleção aren't
the only ones upset

1149
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:29,166
about your request
to become a king.

1150
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:32,000
Thanks to you, Mrs. Iinuma's
pride has been damaged

1151
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:34,250
and her husband's
good name sullied.

1152
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:36,791
It's no surprise
that she hates you.

1153
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:37,916
If she's that mad,

1154
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
why are you taking
Takizawa to see her?

1155
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:42,125
She'd like to
meet you in person.

1156
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,708
She wants to assess
your intentions

1157
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:46,208
regarding the leadership
of the country.

1158
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:48,583
As for me, I'd like to see

1159
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:51,500
what kind of king
you'd make of yourself.

1160
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,166
What do we do now?

1161
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,500
I erased the new search engine,

1162
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,375
but I don't know
how much it'll help.

1163
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:11,708
The next step is shutting down

1164
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:13,708
Eden of the East completely.

1165
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:16,458
At the very least, that should
buy us some more time.

1166
01:08:16,541 --> 01:08:17,708
Huh?!

1167
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,416
Panties, how much
longer will that get us?

1168
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:29,583
It looks like we'll have a
little over forty-eight hours.

1169
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:31,708
That's a decent increase.

1170
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:34,041
It's good to see how
well our system works.

1171
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,166
Think about this.

1172
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,875
Eden's been growing so quickly.

1173
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,708
By now it's practically part
of the public infrastructure.

1174
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:52,583
If we shut it down,

1175
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:53,750
we'll be affecting a lot more

1176
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:55,958
than just twenty-thousand NEETs.

1177
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:59,083
I know. Well, Micchon?

1178
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:01,541
I switched over to the local
area network.

1179
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:09,500
Here we go. Goodbye, Eden.

1180
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:20,750
It's really shut down?

1181
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:22,041
Relax.

1182
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,458
I know you're the one who's
gonna have to deal

1183
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:25,750
with the ton of complaints we'll
be getting about this.

1184
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:28,083
But it's only temporary, so
don't freak out.

1185
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:29,333
But what about Hirasawa?!

1186
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:31,083
I mean he's spent so long
pouring his blood,

1187
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:33,583
sweat, and snot
into Eden of the East!

1188
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:35,791
It's 'tears', not 'snot'!

1189
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:37,541
And Saki?

1190
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:38,541
We can't support her

1191
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:40,000
and Takizawa with
the system down.

1192
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:43,083
What're we supposed to do?

1193
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:44,416
I have an idea.

1194
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,625
Our current location is
under strict surveillance,

1195
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:48,250
which limits our capabilities,

1196
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:50,750
so I propose that
we move headquarters.

1197
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:53,291
Where are we supposed to go?

1198
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:55,750
Sir, I have our
club room at the college

1199
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,791
on reserve in case
of an emergency.

1200
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:59,500
It's not as nice
as the new place,

1201
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:01,875
but the old Eden
system is still there.

1202
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:03,833
It's settled then.

1203
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:07,333
The club room's the perfect
place to help Vintage Boy from.

1204
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:10,291
Yeah, I think you're right.

1205
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,541
An email from Saki!

1206
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,416
It says "We're heading
for the airport.

1207
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,916
Sorry for the sudden notice,

1208
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,958
but Takizawa is
coming back to Japan."

1209
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:23,333
What the heck's she thinking?

1210
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,375
Sorry, sweetie.

1211
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:34,416
I'm afraid this is as
far as you can come.

1212
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:47,416
Hey. What does
this new log mean?

1213
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,583
Number 1 is launching a missile.

1214
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:53,500
Juiz?

1215
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,166
Get me a report
of what's happening

1216
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,583
at the coordinates
in Number 1's log.

1217
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,291
Now, Juiz.

1218
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:39,583
Launch the other missiles
as we previously discussed.

1219
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:44,375
Accepted. Noblesse oblige.

1220
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:46,208
I pray for your
continued success

1221
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:48,916
as a "raze and rebuild" savior.

1222
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:11,541
My number's been blacked out.

1223
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,250
Hey, hello!

1224
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,958
Juiz! Can you hear me, Juiz?

1225
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:22,416
Mononobe has to be behind this.

1226
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,916
I wonder if he located Juiz

1227
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,916
and blew her up
with that missile.

1228
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:31,708
But at least half of my request
has already been accepted.

1229
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:32,958
You're too late.

1230
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:34,791
Besides, Mr. Mononobe,
what you have planned

1231
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:36,875
isn't what this country wants.

1232
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,625
Yuki!

1233
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:50,708
But I thought you were
eliminated by the Supporter!

1234
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:54,458
Actually, I "eliminated" myself.

1235
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:55,833
I destroyed my Noblesse phone

1236
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:57,916
so I could get the
revenge I wanted.

1237
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:21,750
Hello, Juiz.

1238
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,250
I need you to do
something for me.

1239
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:24,375
It's urgent.

1240
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:25,791
What is it?

1241
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,458
Can you move the third trailer

1242
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:32,333
in the convoy to
the front of the line?

1243
01:13:32,416 --> 01:13:34,291
Yes, of course.

1244
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:35,875
Then please do it. Quickly.

1245
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:39,541
Accepted! Noblesse Oblige.

1246
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:43,000
I pray you shall still be
my beautiful savior tomorrow.

1247
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:01,500
Hurry, Juiz. Please hurry.

1248
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,125
Just in time.

1249
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,750
You were the most brilliant
assistant I ever had.

1250
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:27,166
Thank you for everything, Juiz.

1251
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:30,541
This is it, Number 9.

1252
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:32,208
You're on your own now.

1253
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:34,833
I can't be your
guardian angel anymore.

1254
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,416
Number 1 will be wrapping
up the game any time now,

1255
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,541
but I've already
placed my bet on you.

1256
01:14:43,791 --> 01:14:47,000
You will keep your
promise, won't you?

1257
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:48,625
What promise?

1258
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:50,708
I pray you never
forget your true self

1259
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:52,625
when you are king.

1260
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:55,250
What are you doing?

1261
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:56,333
Huh?

1262
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:58,375
Go to him. He
needs somebody's help.

1263
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:00,666
I've done all I can do.

1264
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:09,083
Thank you, Kuroha.

1265
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:17,666
All right, well, it's
about time to go home.

1266
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,875
Ato is so difficult.

1267
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:43,375
If the public
finds out about it,

1268
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:47,000
the political fallout will be
the least of our problems.

1269
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:48,166
Yes, sir.

1270
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,583
The repercussions
would be quite severe.

1271
01:15:49,666 --> 01:15:50,708
That's one of the reasons

1272
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:53,250
we need to sacrifice
Mr. Iinuma's son.

1273
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:54,583
You've proved your worth

1274
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:57,041
before by stopping
those sixty missiles.

1275
01:15:57,125 --> 01:15:58,250
I have every confidence

1276
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,750
that you can handle
this situation neatly.

1277
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:02,916
It's been sixty-five
years since the war.

1278
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,833
All that time, we've let other
countries call the shots for us.

1279
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:07,291
I will break Japan free

1280
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:09,166
from that culture of dependence.

1281
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,375
You have a talent
for gathering information

1282
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:14,250
and intimate knowledge of
the bureaucratic machine.

1283
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:15,666
With you on our side,

1284
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:19,250
I can almost see the old
Ministry rising back into power.

1285
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:22,041
I'll even say "uncle"
again if I have to.

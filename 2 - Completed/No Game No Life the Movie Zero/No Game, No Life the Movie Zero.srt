00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:42,142
<i>I thought there was</i>

3
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,996
<i>That if I tried hard enough,</i>

4
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:57,187

5
00:00:57,287 --> 00:01:00,757
<i>You win, you lose,</i>

6
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:06,664
[TET]
I need a way
that's more precise...

7
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:08,899
Tactics that are
more efficient...

8
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:11,669
I need a superior strategy!

15
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,758

16
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:10,600
<i>But the truth is, life</i>

17
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:14,236
<i>It didn't have to be</i>

18
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:17,240
<i>Unreasonable and unfair.</i>

19
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,043

00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:09,263
[TET]
Not to brag or anything...

28
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:12,432
But I've only been beaten once

Hpmh!

(Angry whine)

32
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:20,308
It is the sixth
of the Ten Pledges.

33
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:24,245
"All bets made in
accordance with the pledges
must be upheld."

34
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:28,383
This law is absolute, per the
one true god who created
our world of Disboard.

[IZUNA]
Hmph.I'll crush you...

36
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:32,888

Look... If you couldn't
beat those two, then
you won't ever beat ME.

Huh? You know about them?
You know about Sora and Shiro?

40
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:44,466
Sure do.

41
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,837
And I've got an interesting
story I can tell you
during our next game...

42
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,006
As thanks for this
wonderful prize.

43
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:54,011

You're just trying to distract
me you dirty cheat. Thanks!

just start talking! Thanks.

[TET]
Very well, then I will.

46
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,653
It's an ancient myth you'll
never be able to tell anyone.

47
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:04,455
[IZUNA]
S'kay. I'm not listening anyway.

48
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,024
(Tet chuckles)

49
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:16,935
[TET]
Well... this story goes back
more than 6,000 years.

50
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:30,116
A bitter war raged,
ravaging the earth and
extinguishing the planets.

51
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:35,656
As time has gone on, no one
remembers it anymore...

52
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:41,228
And yet, this is one tale...
I will never forget.

It's a big one, huh?

54
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:19,168
[RIKU]
Hm. The black ash is
really coming down.

55
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:20,937
We should hurry.

00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:34,285

(Gasping) I'm okay.

60
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:49,135

What does the
Spirit Compass say?

61
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,170
[RIKU]
I can't get a reading
with all the ash.

62
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,540
We'll be relying on
our senses for this recon.

63
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,310
Don't let your guard down.

Riku!

65
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:01,548

66
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:08,722
[IVAN]
No way...

67
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:10,891
[ALEI]
It's a world map, Dwarvish made.

68
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:14,295
And it looks like
the latest version too!

69
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:16,297
[RIKU]
That's not all.

70
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:21,903
This shows the balance of power
between the races and
the dwarves' tactical plan.

71
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:26,575
Ivan. Alei. Compare this
to what we've got and
make any corrections.

72
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:28,443
I'll make sense of this
the best I can.

73
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:30,045
[IVAN &amp; ALEI]
Ascheito!

74

(Powers up)

75
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:48,198
[RIKU]
Uhh...! A message?
From the dwarves?

76
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:56,473
Huh? "Fusion"... "Detonation"?

77
00:06:56,573 --> 00:07:00,678
Exactly how much of this world
do they plan to destroy?

78
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:05,517
(Rumbling and crashing)

79
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:07,185
[RIKU]
Let's get out of here.

80
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,854
Alei. Don't take anything
that runs on spiritual energy.

81
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:11,256
[ALEI]
Yeah, but...!

82
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:13,091
[RIKU]
If you want to die,
go right ahead.

83
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:14,159

[RIKU]
Ivan, this is an order.

89
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:54,503
You will die here.

90
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:55,904
[IVAN]
Ascheito.

91
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:58,206
[ALEI]
Ah! Ivan! Wait!

92
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,049
[IVAN]
Look after my kid, Riku.

93
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,088
Promise you will do that for‐

94
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,160
(Ivan roars)

95
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:19,096
I'm over here!

96
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:22,466
Come and get me, Demonia!

97
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,507
(Electric sparking)

98
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:04,144
[RIKU]
<i>They say there used to be</i>
<i>something called "the Sun."</i>

99
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,614
<i>Its white flames lit</i>

100
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:12,153
<i>turning the skies the most</i>

<i>ever seen.</i>

101
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:16,424
<i>And then there's an old story,</i>
<i>like something out of</i>
<i>a fairy tale.</i>

102
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:20,628
<i>The gods and their creations</i>
<i>waged eternal war...</i>

103
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:25,067
<i>The earth burned, choking</i>
<i>the heavens with soot</i>

104
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:28,837
<i>and raining down</i>
<i>the ashes of the dead.</i>

105

[ALEI]
Ah! Riku!

106
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:35,912
(Riku grunts)

107
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:39,182
[RIKU]
These ashes...

108
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:44,354
It's the least we can do,
to honor them... I guess.

109
00:10:05,844 --> 00:10:08,447
[COURONNE]
Non...na. Heh heh...

110
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:09,981

[COURONNE]
Well... You took your time!

124
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,746
Were you like trying to give me
a heart attack or something?

125

they're back.

Your daddy...

141

your daddy won't be
coming home anymore.

[NONNA]
How... come?

143
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:33,271
Because he's dead.

You're lying!

[RIKU]
It's true Nonna.

147
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:40,913
[NONNA]
No, it's not! Daddy promised me
he'd come home!

148
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,415
He said we'd win!

149
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:45,051
He said when it was over
the humans would win.

[RIKU]
We WILL win.

151

It's why... it's why
your daddy fought so hard...

152
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:52,459
He did it... so the
rest of us could win.

153
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,495
That's not "winning" anything!
It should've been you!

154
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:57,897
You! You're the one
who should've died!

yourselves up in the bath.

[RIKU]
I'll just dust myself off.

160
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,690
[COURONNE]
No. Take a bath.

161
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,959
You guys stink.

So we...
so we could "win" huh?...

165
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,410
I'm a gods‐damned hypocrite!

(Grunts)

170
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:49,253
I did it!

171
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,389
It was me! I killed him!

172
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:54,826
I sacrificed him just so I could
live a little while longer!

173
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:56,595
Aah!

If this keeps going on,
then what's the point?

00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:03,635
How far are we willing to go?

177
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:08,340
Do we kill half the people...
for the sake of saving
the other half?

178
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,676
How many is it going to take?

179
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:13,646
Do we keep going 'til there's
only one person left?!

180
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:19,685
When are we gonna be
done with this?

living like animals?!

Response: To analyze the
unique language humans
use among themselves.

The language referred to
as "the heart."

The heart, huh?

234
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:37,297
Reasoning: This unit's
investigation into the
existence of the heart

235
00:17:37,397 --> 00:17:41,801
generated multiple logic errors,
causing this unit to
be disassociated.

236
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:45,438
Thereafter, further
observation has been
conducted independently.

237
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:49,776
"Observation"? So, your plan
is to study the heart
on your own...

238
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:53,079
and get the Cluster
to take you back, yes?

00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,818

Desire. It is postulated
that dermal contact,

240
00:17:56,918 --> 00:18:01,422

a unique exchange of emotions.

241
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:03,290
I request you
procreate with this unit.

I don't think so!

advantage of this unit

250
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:34,458

participation. In the game.

253
00:18:40,631 --> 00:18:47,405
Conditions: If this unit wins,
it shall be taken home with you
and procreation shall occur.

I can only assume you
choose chess on purpose.

255
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:58,350
You guys are basically
walking calculators,

256
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,852
so there's no way I can win.

257
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:03,455
Still...

258
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:05,291
What if...

259
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,709
I DO manage to win?

260
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:10,679
Answer: You shall
take this unit home...

261
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:13,349
and then immediate
procreation shall occur.

262
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:15,117
[RIKU]
That's the same frickin' thing!

263
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:16,686
Well, whatever.

264
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:19,889
I guess there's no getting out
of it at this point is there?

265
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:21,758
Fine. I'll play along.

266
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:24,527
[EX MACHINA]
Conclusion: A game in accordance
with the aforementioned terms.

267
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:27,130
[RIKU]
Sure. I'll play you one time.

268
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,700
Except, I'll be making...

269
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,936
a slight change to these
little rules of yours.

270
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:35,939

00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,282

272
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,058
Ugh!

273
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,061
[EX MACHINA]
We have arrived.

274
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,564
[RIKU]
Um‐so... When it
comes to mobility,

275
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,167
you really don't use
any spiritual energy?

276
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,468
[EX MACHINA]
Correct.

277
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,570
Utilizing spiritual energy
would have saved

278
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,573
fifty‐five thousand, seven
hundred and eighty‐two seconds.

279
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:08,775

Ugh...

280
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,177
[EX MACHINA]
Addendum: This unit
is a "Prufer,"

281
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,746
a model primarily
used for analysis.

282
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:14,981
Its capabilities are lesser
than other Ex Machina.

283
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:18,252
[RIKU]
With a half‐assed "race"
like this waging war,

284
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:21,322
it's no wonder
the world's gone to hell.

285
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:24,058
[RIKU]
What should I call you?

286
00:20:24,158 --> 00:20:25,327
[EX MACHINA]
Meaning unknown.

287
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:27,229

292
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,706
Forget that. You're going
to need to go with
something easier.

293
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:39,975
[EX MACHINA]
Query: If this unit wins,

294
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:44,480
it will stay with Riku until
it is able to fully comprehend
the human heart.

295
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,650
Should this unit conceal
that it is a machine?

296
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,220
[RIKU]
The heart's like an unspoken
feeling that is formed through
mutual understanding.

297
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:54,858
And if you're gonna be with me,
then you're going to need to
dress like a human.

298
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,828
[EX MACHINA]
Query: Is self‐designation
an option?

299
00:20:57,928 --> 00:20:59,429
[RIKU]
Sure, whatever.

300
00:21:01,431 --> 00:21:04,101
[EX MACHINA]
Response: I shall be Schwarzer.

301
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:07,572
[RIKU]
Nope, that's hard to say
and weird. Not gonna
work for me.

302
00:21:07,672 --> 00:21:09,240
Let's just go with "Schwi."

303
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,342
[EX MACHINA]
Unclear. Adjustment was made
for self‐configuration.

304
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:14,445
[RIKU]
Can we do something about
the way you talk before
we get started?

305
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:19,885
[EX MACHINA]

for you, Big Brother?

307
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:24,556
[RIKU]
Ugh. Never mind!

308
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:27,159
Retort: Setting was the most
logical choice available.

309
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:31,798
[RIKU]
And what "logical" nonsense did
you use to position yourself
as my younger sister?

310
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:35,268
Answer: I merely presented what
was the most optimal option.

311
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:37,004
Yeah, well...

312
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:40,073
It'd be a big problem if
people were to start
asking about our past.

313
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,444
Just act shy, and don't say
more than you have to.

314
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:46,347
And quit starting every sentence
sounding like a robot...

315
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:48,349
Understood?

316
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:52,453
[SCHWI] (Speaking normally)
Understood.

317
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:55,657
Something like this?

318
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:58,927
Uh... Are you...
acting or something?

319
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,730
"Acting"? I'm not.

320
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,600
I have chosen a personality
matching the given parameters.

321
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,903
It's a trace emulation.

322
00:22:08,003 --> 00:22:09,772
Hm... it'll do...

323
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:12,175
[RIKU]
I want you to stay
where I can see you.

324
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:14,110
And keep those clothes on.

325
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,014
Is there maybe something you
can do about that tail‐looking
thing you got there?

326
00:22:18,114 --> 00:22:19,382
[SCHWI]
Negative.

327
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:20,884
It is Schwi's power source,

328
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:24,588
a nerve corer of
quasi‐spiritual circuitry...

329
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:26,490
Ah... Alright, fine I guess.

330
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,359
We'll just say it's
a fashion choice.

331
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:30,061
But, I'm going to say
this one more time:

332
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:33,931
Do NOT show that robot body of
yours to anyone else. Okay?

333
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:37,346
[SCHWI]
Yes. I will show it only to you.

334
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:40,216
[COURONNE]
Awww! She's so cute!
Who is she?!

335
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:44,521
[RIKU]
Found her on the way back,
at a colony that'd been
wiped out. She was in a...

336
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:47,324
[COURONNE]
Oh! So is she... your wife?!

337
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:48,325
[SCHWI]
His "Wife"?

338
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:49,359
[RIKU]
Uh...!

339
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:50,694
Oh c'mon, don't be shy.

340
00:22:50,794 --> 00:22:52,162
Now your first priority
should be having kids,

341
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:53,331
and then next is food,

342
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:54,898
and then of course having
five or six more kids!

343
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,033
Would you please cut that out.

344
00:22:56,134 --> 00:22:57,435
And you that goes for you too!

345
00:22:57,535 --> 00:22:58,903
[SCHWI]
What does she mean?

346
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,872
[RIKU]
She doesn't mean anything!

347
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:02,540
[COURONNE]
What's your name?

348
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:03,975
I'm Schwi.

349
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:05,710
[COURONNE]
That's a lovely name.

350
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,580
So, how did you meet
Riku here anyway?

351
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,481
(Riku annoyed)

352
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:11,216
[SCHWI]
Well he...

353
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:12,717
He kissed Schwi.

354
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:16,055
And demanded that the two of us
partake in procreation.

355
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,394
[RIKU]
Uh... Uh no, I just...!

356
00:23:21,494 --> 00:23:22,995
[COURONNE]
Riku...

357
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:25,498
You couldn't wait
could you, huh...

358
00:23:25,598 --> 00:23:28,501
Don't you have
a shred of decency?!

359
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,003
(Slap)

360
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:33,374
[RIKU]
You could've worded that
differently, you know.

361
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:34,508
[SCHWI]
"Differently"?

362
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:36,177
[RIKU]
Never mind.

363
00:23:36,277 --> 00:23:39,546
Look, could you at least try
to look a bit more mature?

364
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:43,450
You're making me
look bad over here.

365
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:46,153
[SCHWI]
Okay. But isn't this
the form that you prefer.

366
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:49,091
[RIKU]
Nah, that ain't my thing.

367
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:51,593
[SCHWI]
Then... what form DO you like?

368
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:53,295
[RIKU]
Now you listen here...

369
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:56,398
Do you even know what it means
when you ask that question?

370
00:23:57,966 --> 00:23:59,768
[SCHWI]
I'm wanting to know
what you prefer.

371
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:03,439
[RIKU]
That's not something I can
really tell you with words.

372
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,075
You remember how I explained
the human heart?

373
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:08,211
[SCHWI]
I remember.

374
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,814
So then. Let's play.

375
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:12,649
[RIKU]
No thanks.

376
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:15,219
I didn't have much
choice before, but...

377
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:18,989
I find games pointless,
and I don't have the time
to waste on them.

378
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:21,726
[SCHWI]
What if...
they are not pointless?

379
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:27,265
What if you win, the prize
will be all the information
you desire.

380
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,699
For example...

381
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,569
the reason that
the Great War began.

382
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:34,305
And what it will take to end it.

383
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,843
[RIKU]
Uh! Gimme a break.

384
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,246
We humans don't have
any choice in that nonsense,

385
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,514
so there's no point
in bothering with it.

386
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:46,753
There's only one thing
I need to know how to do.

387
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,757
How to make it
through the day alive.

388
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:52,825
And that's it.

389
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:57,397
That's the whole reason
I brought you along.

390
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:02,970
The knowledge, the math,
the engineering tech
you Ex Machina contain...

391
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,906
If I can beat you,
then THAT'S what I want.

392
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:09,477
[SCHWI]
Hm... Understood.

393
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:14,282
Given the current state
of our world,

394
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:17,886
the fact that humans
have survived is...

395
00:25:17,986 --> 00:25:21,256
an anomaly.

396
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:24,793
Even we Ex Machina cannot
calculate a reason for this.

397
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:29,865
As lifeforms, you are weak.
Your civilization is primitive.

398
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:33,936
You cannot utilize
spiritual power. And yet...

399
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:36,672
You have subsisted.

400
00:25:36,772 --> 00:25:38,241
It defies all reason.

401
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:42,479
Yet there must be an answer...
a key to your survival.

402
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:46,983
And my theory is... that
it resides in the human heart.

403
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,353
And I intend to find it.

404
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:50,587
I wish to discover‐

405
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:51,789
Enough...

406
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:53,357
Hmm...?

407
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:55,660
[RIKU]
(scoff) You're so full of shit.

408
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,994
[SCHWI]
Riku?

409
00:25:57,094 --> 00:25:58,496
[RIKU]
You do whatever you want.

410
00:25:58,596 --> 00:25:59,964
You wage war whenever want.

411
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,699
You've taken everything from us,

412
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,003
and well I'm so sorry if you're
puzzled why we're still alive.

413
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:09,341
No wonder you know nothing
about the human heart.

414
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,208
(Grunts)

415
00:26:10,308 --> 00:26:11,877
Okay fine, you wann know!

416
00:26:11,977 --> 00:26:13,746
What I feel in
my heart hasn't changed

417
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:16,482
one damn bit since
the moment I was born!

418
00:26:17,884 --> 00:26:20,453
You can burn in hell,
every last one of you!

419
00:26:20,553 --> 00:26:22,088
(Schwi gasps)

420
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:24,023
Do you know how many people have
died because of you bastards?

421
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:27,394
You probably know exactly
how many! Don't you?!

422
00:26:27,494 --> 00:26:31,098
And how many more
will you make US kill?

423
00:26:31,198 --> 00:26:34,969
Riku... I have made you cry.

424
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:36,404
So therefore...

425
00:26:36,504 --> 00:26:40,108
I assume...
I have said something terrible.

426
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,577
Something to hurt you.

427
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:44,880
(Riku sobs)

428
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,583
What I do know
about the heart...

429
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,785
is that deep inside it...

430
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:52,854
you wish to kill me.

431
00:26:52,954 --> 00:26:57,559
Riku. You can stab me.
I will die.

432
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:01,097
Rather... Since I am
not a living being,

433
00:27:01,197 --> 00:27:03,600
it will be a
permanent cessation,

434
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,035
with repair
not being possible...

435
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:09,606
A complete systemic failure.

436
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:11,975
I wish to know your heart.

437
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:13,276
That is all.

438
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:16,113
If this is truly what
your heart desires...

439
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:18,549
then I want it to be realized.

440
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:20,484
I want you to kill me.

441
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:22,120
(Riku gasps)

(Riku gasping)

454
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,101
Forty‐eight people...
Forty‐eight!

455
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:09,571
And I am the one who
ordered them all to die!

456
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:12,540
Too many people have died
during your Great War...

457
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,978
removed from this world
like dust being swept away.

458
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:19,748
And the one who sent
those people to die...

459
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:22,618
The one who told them to...

460
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,190
(Groans)

461
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:40,470
Riku?

462
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:44,541
(Crying)

463
00:28:49,747 --> 00:28:51,716
Oh...

464
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,395
[COURONNE]
Riku? You awake?

465
00:29:03,495 --> 00:29:07,599
Sorry, I know you're tired, but
if you don't mind.. I'd uh...

466
00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:11,103
AHH! Sorry!

467
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:15,575
[RIKU] Uh...
(Couronne giggles)

468
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:19,779
Um, okay Schwi, do you mind
if I ask you why you're
sitting there straddling me?

469
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:23,183
[SCHWI]
Riku... You instructed me to
stay where you could see me.

470
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:25,185
[RIKU]
I only meant for you
to stay nearby.

471
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:28,989
[SCHWI]
Question: If I'm not in
your line of sight
then can you see me?

472
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:30,224
[COURONNE]
Oh, is this some sort
of roleplay?

473
00:29:30,324 --> 00:29:31,592
[RIKU]
Close the damn door!

474
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:33,594
Oh, it's okay sweetie,
I understand...

475
00:29:33,694 --> 00:29:36,931
Whenever you're done,
let me know and
Schwi can take a bath.

476
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:39,501
Uh... don't mind her.

477
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:41,536
Mph...

478
00:29:43,037 --> 00:29:44,606
I see.

479
00:29:44,706 --> 00:29:48,377
Riku said I can show my body
only to him. In that case...

480
00:29:48,477 --> 00:29:50,279
[COURONNE]
Whaah! You have her trained?!

481
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:52,381
Couronne, would you please
just leave us alone?!

482
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:54,283
[COURONNE]
Oh wow, things sure are
moving quickly.

483
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:56,319
Okay, I'll let you two
have some privacy.

484
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,055
And I'll go kick out
whoever's in the bath.

485
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:02,192
(Riku groans)

486
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,709
[SCHWI]
I am... sorry.

487
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:19,410
[RIKU]
Sorry for what?

488
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:22,847
[SCHWI]
For being the aggressor
and yet asking about the heart.

489
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:24,882
It's illogical.

490
00:30:24,982 --> 00:30:28,821
[RIKU]
I wouldn't say "illogical"
‐ it's insensitive.

491
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:32,224
[SCHWI]
My circuits... are capable
of sensitive transmission.

492
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:35,894
[RIKU]
Um, that's not what I meant.

493
00:30:35,994 --> 00:30:39,465
In any case... I'm sorry that
I got way all worked up.

494
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:41,634
[SCHWI]
Is that a bad thing to do?

495
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:45,038
[RIKU]
Could be. I might lose it
and smack you,

496
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:47,240
and that wouldn't
solve anything would it?

497
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:49,075
[SCHWI]
Do you wish to strike me, Riku?

498
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:52,212
[RIKU]
Of course not,
I'm just making a point.

499
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,849
I, uh... I don't know...

500
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:57,852
Maybe I'm not so sure myself.

501
00:30:59,186 --> 00:31:01,289
[SCHWI]
Riku. Let's play a game.

502
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:02,823
[RIKU]
Huh?

503
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:07,095
(Riku sighs)

504
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:10,331
What did you bring
that thing for?

505
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:13,334
[SCHWI]
Because... that's when
you smiled, Riku.

506
00:31:13,435 --> 00:31:15,036
It's the only time.

507
00:31:15,136 --> 00:31:16,305
[RIKU]
Uh...?

508
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:18,307
[SCHWI]
So...

509
00:31:20,242 --> 00:31:21,878
Let's... play a game.

510
00:31:21,978 --> 00:31:24,280
[RIKU]
Huh?

511
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,517
[SCHWI]
I wish... I wish to know
your heart, Riku.

512
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:31,088
But also... not in
a manner that hurts you.

513
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:33,390
I have a conflict.

514
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,160
I don't know what to do.

515
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,362
You mean you'd have to
hurt me in order to do it?

516
00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:41,565
Can't you just go
back to your Cluster?

517
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:44,001
I'm sure you can learn
all you want about the heart

518
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,269
without forcing it out of me.

519
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:47,806
[SCHWI]
Yes. That's true.

520
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:52,310
But either way, I do not wish
to cause you harm...

521
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,380
Why is that?

522
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,915
[RIKU]
Wha...? You're asking ME?

523
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,317
(Data processing)

524
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,718
[SCHWI]
Stating possibility.

525
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,521
Answer: The unit has found
the Cluster pointless,

526
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,023
and meaningless, and irrelevant,

527
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:07,360
with personal analysis of
the heart taking prominence.

528
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,928
I want you to remain.

529
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:12,265
Error. Error. Error. Error.
[RIKU] Uh! Agh! What's going on?

530
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,300
Ah! Hey cut that out!

531
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:22,209
Conclusion: It seems
I don't want... to go back.

532
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:23,877
It seems?

533
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:26,047
Unable to quantify definitely.

534
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:27,849
Although...

535
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:30,818
It would seem so.

536
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:33,321
So it does... Heheh...

537
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:35,957
but it's a little confusing.

538
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:38,493
[SCHWI]
Pawn to E‐4.

539
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:40,595
[RIKU]
Hey, you could at least
let me have the first move.

540
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:42,564
[SCHWI]
The next turn is yours.

541
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:44,500
[RIKU]
Also, you're playing while I'm
sitting here brushing your hair.

542
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,301
That's not very fair, is it?

543
00:32:46,402 --> 00:32:49,605
So, why's it so long anyway?

544
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:51,874
If you would prefer it
to be short, I will cut it.

545
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:53,542
Hehe. No, you don't
have to do that.

546
00:32:53,642 --> 00:32:56,646
Heheh. You just don't
get it, do you?

547
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:15,766
[COURONNE]
Oh...

548
00:33:18,904 --> 00:33:20,471
Hmm....

549
00:33:33,452 --> 00:33:34,186
[SCHWI]
Riku.

550
00:33:34,286 --> 00:33:35,955
[RIKU]
Hm? Uhh?

551
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,359
[SCHWI]
Here you go. I have designed
a compact telescope.

552
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:42,162
[RIKU]
Look I told you. I still
haven't beaten you at chess.

553
00:33:42,262 --> 00:33:45,032
[SCHWI]
But I... thought this
was what you wanted.

554
00:33:45,132 --> 00:33:47,067
So I made it for you.

555
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:49,336
Um... Huh...

556
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:52,406
[SCHWI]
That is where I met you.

557
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:54,875
[RIKU]
Uh, yeah.

558
00:33:54,975 --> 00:33:57,611
There's something about
that place that's
always really bugged me...

559
00:33:57,711 --> 00:34:02,416
but it's so far away
that I can't just get up
and walk there can I?

560
00:34:04,152 --> 00:34:05,286
[RIKU]
Ugh!

561
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:06,988
[SCHWI]
We've arrived.

562
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,058
(Riku slow coughs)

563
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:13,028
Well you sure are the
observant one arent'cha? Hooray.

564
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:17,199
[RIKU]
Have you noticed?
The buildings are all destroyed,

565
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:21,204
but for some reason, the ground
here is mostly untouched.

566
00:34:21,304 --> 00:34:24,674
[SCHWI]
That would be because of
the elves' protective magic.

567
00:34:24,774 --> 00:34:29,580
[RIKU]
But why let everything get
completely wiped out
except for this one spot?

568
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,083
[SCHWI]
To the elves, this was
an important facility,

569
00:34:33,183 --> 00:34:38,322
an emergency shelter,
or perhaps something else.

570
00:34:38,422 --> 00:34:41,158
Something of more value.

571
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:49,067
A facility to research
and develop new weaponry.

572
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:57,910
[RIKU]
What the hell is this?

573
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,714
[SCHWI]
Protective glyphs of
the Old Deus Kainas.

574
00:35:01,814 --> 00:35:04,250
[RIKU]
Kainas... That's the
creator of the elves.

575
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,253
[SCHWI]
Huh... These are not
protective glyphs.

576
00:35:07,353 --> 00:35:10,256
And they do not correspond
to any available data

577
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:12,326
regarding elvish glyphs
or magical rites.

578
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:16,196
[RIKU]
It's probably some damn new
horrible foolishness
they invented.

579
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:20,000
They're as hell‐bent as the
dwarves to destroy the planet.

580
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,673
[RIKU]
"Aka Si Anse...
proof of concept reactor..."

581
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:28,743
[SCHWI]
Riku... you can read
the Elvish language?

582
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:33,548
[RIKU]
The best clues and information
out there is worthless
if you can't understand it.

583
00:35:33,649 --> 00:35:38,253
To this day, the traits,
and the languages, and the
customs of the various races

584
00:35:38,354 --> 00:35:43,459
have been passed down in
oral history, written works...
any means you can think of.

585
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:46,295
It's what we do ‐
because we lowly humans

586
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,198
aren't going to just sit back
and let ourselves get wiped out.

587
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:50,467
[SCHWI]
Oh...

588
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,134
[RIKU]
That being said...

589
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:54,837
I can't read a damn thing
else on here.

590
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:58,175
Especially this part.
It must be like a name, right?

591
00:35:58,275 --> 00:36:00,978
[SCHWI]
If this is all
classified information,

592
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:04,815
then it is most likely that
it is in code. Encrypted.

593
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:07,318
[RIKU]
Yeah, you're right
and that's a problem.

594
00:36:07,418 --> 00:36:12,090
It means even the names of
whoever's involved with this
have also been encrypted.

595
00:36:12,657 --> 00:36:14,993
"Aka Si Anse..."

596
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:19,864
The only thing we know for sure
so far, is a bunch of
friggin' nonsense, huh?

597
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:23,468
(Gasp)

598
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:25,204
[SCHWI]
Riku, stand back!

599
00:36:25,304 --> 00:36:26,906
Losen.

600
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:28,173
Einweg!

601
00:36:34,514 --> 00:36:35,881
[SCHWI]
Run!

602
00:36:41,688 --> 00:36:43,457
[RIKU]
Dammit!

603
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:44,858
[SCHWI]
Uhh!

604
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:46,327
[RIKU]
Schwi!

605
00:36:46,427 --> 00:36:48,629
[SCHWI]
Oh...! Ah...

606
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:52,133
[SCHWI]
Ah...!

607
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:53,801
[RIKU]
Schwi!

608
00:36:54,502 --> 00:36:55,770
[SCHWI]
Ri...

609
00:36:57,905 --> 00:36:59,073
Ugh!

610
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:08,050
(Grunts and groans)

611
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,956
(Gasp)

612
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,826
Eh...

613
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:18,594
Schwi...

614
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:20,263
Schwi!

615
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,236
Uh... Schwi...

616
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,907
[SCHWI]
Their security system...

617
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:33,177
The elvish magic...
remains active.

618
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:34,479
[RIKU]
Huh?

619
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:36,647
[SCHWI]
Don't worry. It will be fine.

620
00:37:36,747 --> 00:37:38,148
[SCHWI]
Losen.

621
00:37:38,249 --> 00:37:40,318
Steh Apokryphen.

622
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:49,395
[RIKU]
Ah... What was that?

623
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:51,830
[SCHWI]
A special ability of
the Ex Machina.

624
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,534
If attacked, we can analyze,
emulate, and reproduce
the attack,

625
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:56,903
copying it.

626
00:37:57,003 --> 00:38:00,072
But as a Prufer, I would
only be able to generate

627
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:03,810
less than 10% of
its original strength.

628
00:38:04,677 --> 00:38:06,045
[RIKU]
Yeah, if you say so...

629
00:38:06,146 --> 00:38:09,116
But you might still
tone it down a bit.

630
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:13,186
[SCHWI]
I'm sorry.

631
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:15,022
[RIKU]
Huh?

632
00:38:15,122 --> 00:38:18,626
[SCHWI]
I broke my promise.
And I used spiritual energy.

633
00:38:18,726 --> 00:38:22,030
[RIKU]
Yeah well. I guess
it's better than dying.

634
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,265
Anyway we should probably
get out of here pretty quick

635
00:38:24,365 --> 00:38:28,002
before some band of freaks
comes and finds us.

636
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:32,040
(High winds)

637
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:35,177
[RIKU]
Dammit! We've got a soot storm.

638
00:38:35,277 --> 00:38:36,578
[SCHWI]
I will be fine.

639
00:38:36,678 --> 00:38:38,681
My system pumps a
decontamination solution

640
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:40,616
that purges the
impurities of the ash.

641
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:43,753
[RIKU]
You may be fine, but that
doesn't mean I would be.

642
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:53,930
[RIKU]
So, I see... you brought
the chess set, right?

643
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,499
[SCHWI]
Yes, I'm sorry.

644
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,034
[RIKU]
No, it's not that
I'm criticizing you.

645
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,571
[RIKU]
You wanna play a game?

646
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,638
You don't mind?

647
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:03,274
No, this is good.

648
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,043
We're stuck down here because of
the storm and everything.

649
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,880
It's a good way
to kill some time, right?

650
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,383
[SCHWI]
Hmm!

651
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,724
(Riku grunts)
[RIKU]
Come on! How do you
keep doing that?!!

652
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:20,325
One more time!

653
00:39:20,426 --> 00:39:22,127
[SCHWI]
Riku... Why do you
keep challenging me

654
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:23,662
when you know that you
cannot beat me?

655
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,864
[RIKU]
"I can't beat you"?

656
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:28,701
[SCHWI]
Yes, well. You haven't yet.
Not even once.

657
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:32,305
(Riku sighs)
[RIKU]
Look, I'm just thinking about
this in the big picture.

658
00:39:32,405 --> 00:39:33,673
The law of averages.

659
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:36,576
There's no way you can
beat me every single time.

660
00:39:36,676 --> 00:39:38,178
[SCHWI]
Oh...

661
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:43,517
[SCHWI]
I... I understand. Partially.

662
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:45,485
[RIKU]
Huh?

663
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:48,923
[SCHWI]
The current conditions
upon this planet are
fatal for all humanity.

664
00:39:49,023 --> 00:39:51,859
The fact that you exist is...
an aberration.

665
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:53,494
[RIKU]
Hmm...

666
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:55,864
[SCHWI]
This aberration...

667
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:59,601
Correction: This accomplishment
is possible...

668
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:03,272
Because of your heart...
your will.

669
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:05,006
(Riku annoyed)

670
00:40:05,107 --> 00:40:08,110
[SCHWI]
Despite overwhelming odds,
humanity as a whole survives...

671
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,080
this is an objective fact...
and yet...

672
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,250
you refuse to accept that fact.

673
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:18,355
For some reason, you do not wish
to acknowledge what you are.

674
00:40:18,455 --> 00:40:20,190
Why is that?

675
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,728
[RIKU]
Well, let me ask you this:

676
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:27,931
What's the point of surviving
when you live in a world
like this one?

677
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:33,504
You just run as hard and
as fast as you can, and you
keep running... but what then?

678
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:35,173
What the hell else do you do?

679
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:39,110
Just sit back and let yourself
get obliterated into nothing?!

680
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,945
And if you don't like that idea,

681
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:44,716
can you let 999 people die
for the sake of 1,001?

682
00:40:44,816 --> 00:40:47,286
Will that change
anything at all?! Huh?!

683
00:40:47,386 --> 00:40:48,954
[SCHWI]
Riku...

684
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:55,895
[RIKU]
Tell me this, Schwi:
What else can we do?

685
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,563
(Riku crying)

686
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,133
What should I do?

687
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:06,339
[SCHWI]
I wish to know as well.

688
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,578
So then... What does
your heart tell you, Riku?

689
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:16,450
[RIKU]
Heh... Just look at what
a freakin' mess I am, huh?

690
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,721
I asked you, 'cause honestly,
I don't know.

691
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:21,889
I'm afraid my heart's
not talking.

692
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:24,993
[SCHWI]
In that case...
What do you wish to do?

693
00:41:25,093 --> 00:41:27,896
[RIKU]
Um... uh...?

694
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:29,732
"What I wish to do"?

695
00:41:29,832 --> 00:41:33,001
[SCHWI]
Whatever it is...
I will help you.

696
00:41:33,101 --> 00:41:35,404
I will be right by your side...

697
00:41:36,772 --> 00:41:38,241
And I will stay there...

698
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:41,510
Until I understand your heart.

699
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,246
I shall keep watch over you...

700
00:41:43,346 --> 00:41:47,083
to see what it is that
your heart truly desires.

701
00:41:47,183 --> 00:41:50,687
I wish to do whatever
it is YOU wish to do Riku.

702
00:41:50,787 --> 00:41:52,256
[RIKU]
Uhhh!

703
00:42:02,233 --> 00:42:06,237
[SCHWI]
Checkmate.

704
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:12,010
[RIKU]
Schwi... That would've probably
been a pretty good time to maybe
call it a draw? I'm just sayin'.

705
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,614
[SCHWI]
Has there been any changes
in atmospheric conditions?

706
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:18,250
[RIKU]
Uh...? No...

707
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,351
(Laughs)

708
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:23,489
No... Hehe...
No, there hasn't.

709
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:33,566
[SCHWI]
Ohh...

710
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:34,667
[RIKU]
Ohh...

711
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:36,469
[BOTH]
It's beautiful.

712
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,838
[RIKU]
Huh?

713
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:40,140
(Chuckle)

714
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,612
[RIKU]
Schwi... it's kinda nice...
not being alone, huh?

715
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:48,950
[SCHWI]
Huh? Riku, you haven't always
been alone, have you?

716
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,785
[RIKU]
Nah. But like an idiot,

717
00:42:50,885 --> 00:42:52,921
I've always pushed
myself to extremes,

718
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:55,457
trying to be something...
special.

719
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:57,960
But anyway...

720
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,395
If I were to just go by what
I want to do, well then...

721
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,598
things might actually
work out pretty well.

722
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:04,534
[SCHWI]
Oh...

723
00:43:06,802 --> 00:43:08,171
[RIKU]
Schwi...

724
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:12,042
Tell me something.
What's the point of this war?

725
00:43:12,142 --> 00:43:14,711
And what can we do to end it?

726
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,853
[RIKU]
<i>When I was a child,</i>
<i>I thought the world was</i>
<i>a much, much simpler place.</i>

727
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:25,456
<i>I thought there was</i>
<i>no challenge that</i>
<i>was unbeatable...</i>

728
00:43:25,556 --> 00:43:29,460
<i>that if I tried hard enough,</i>
<i>anything was possible.</i>

729
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:33,465
<i>Everything was cut and dry:</i>

730
00:43:33,565 --> 00:43:38,503
<i>You win, you lose,</i>
<i>or it ends in a draw.</i>

731
00:43:38,603 --> 00:43:42,040
<i>I thought I was seeing the</i>
<i>world with clear eyes.</i>

732
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,477
<i>But it...</i>

733
00:43:44,577 --> 00:43:48,281
<i>But it was all such</i>
<i>foolish, ignorant youth.</i>

734
00:43:49,582 --> 00:43:51,784
<i>And you know...</i>

735
00:43:51,885 --> 00:43:53,619
<i>in the end...</i>

736
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,822
It turns out I was dead wrong.

737
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:57,223
[SCHWI]
Huh?

738
00:43:57,323 --> 00:43:59,359
You know what, Schwi...
together, I think we can

739
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:02,496
make things in this world
get interesting.

740
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,299
Yes. That's it there.

741
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:07,601
Those eyes are good, Riku.

742
00:44:07,702 --> 00:44:09,837
I have... good eyes?

743
00:44:09,937 --> 00:44:11,639
[SCHWI]
No.

744
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:16,677
Schwi... likes to
see those eyes.

745
00:44:16,777 --> 00:44:19,580
I mean. Don't you?

746
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,149
[RIKU]
Uh?

747
00:44:21,249 --> 00:44:24,019
Ah... Hehehe...

748
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,755
There you go,
bein' confusing again.

749
00:44:26,855 --> 00:44:27,823
[SCHWI]
Huh?

750
00:44:27,923 --> 00:44:32,494
(Riku laughs)

751
00:44:34,664 --> 00:44:36,666
(Splash)

752
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:55,319
(Gasps)

753
00:44:55,419 --> 00:44:57,421
[LILY]
This is really bad!

754
00:44:57,521 --> 00:44:58,823
(Rumbling)

755
00:44:58,923 --> 00:45:01,693
[COURONNE]
Please remain calm!
Head for the west exit!

756
00:45:01,793 --> 00:45:03,495
Nonna, you go with the others.

757
00:45:03,595 --> 00:45:04,295
[NONNA]
Mm‐hm!

758
00:45:04,396 --> 00:45:05,597
[COURONNE]
Okay, now go!

759
00:45:05,697 --> 00:45:07,266
(General panic)

760
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:09,268
[COURONNE]
Ah!

761
00:45:10,635 --> 00:45:12,037
Riku! Oh!

762
00:45:12,137 --> 00:45:15,274
(Riku sobbing, choking up)

763
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:17,410
[COURONNE]
R‐Riku...

764
00:45:18,311 --> 00:45:19,579
[RIKU]
Dammit!

765
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,216
This place will get
turned to ash too?

766
00:45:23,316 --> 00:45:24,750
Then what...?

767
00:45:24,851 --> 00:45:28,555
Tell me, huh? What have I
done all this for?!

768
00:45:28,655 --> 00:45:32,559
[COURONNE]
Riku. C'mon, you can't
worry about that now.

769
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:36,397
Why don't you just let me
take things from here, okay?

770
00:45:36,497 --> 00:45:38,132
(Crying)

771
00:45:38,232 --> 00:45:40,868
[RIKU]
Schwi. You put that
in writing, right?

772
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:42,303
[SCHWI]
Yes, I did.

773
00:45:42,403 --> 00:45:43,771
[COURONNE]
Huh?

774
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:45,273
[RIKU]
Which means, Couronne,

775
00:45:45,373 --> 00:45:47,542
that as of today,
you're head of the colony.

776
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:50,412
And that... is the site
for your new colony.

777
00:45:50,512 --> 00:45:53,248
You'll be safe if you stay
on the western escape route.

778
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:55,283
Well, best of luck
to you and everything.

779
00:45:55,383 --> 00:45:57,386
[COURONNE]
Hey! Riku, wait a second Riku!

780
00:45:57,486 --> 00:45:59,588
Without you, me and the
rest of the camp are doomed!

781
00:45:59,688 --> 00:46:02,858
[RIKU]
Nah, everything's gonna be fine.

782
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:04,660
Because from here on out...

783
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:05,962
no one else is gonna die.

784
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:07,764
[COURONNE]
Huh?

785
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,233
Riku!

786
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,172
Uhh...

787
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:18,208
Hm...

788
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:23,448
Hey guys! So what sort of
craziness are you two
cooking up, huh?

789
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:26,751
[RIKU]
Oh you know. Just a little game.

790
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:31,322
We're gonna take it easy
just pass the time.

791
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:33,659
[RIKU]
As of now,
everyone here is dead.

792
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:36,495
We did not make it
out of the colony in time.

793
00:46:36,595 --> 00:46:40,232
We no longer exist
in this world...

794
00:46:40,332 --> 00:46:42,434
We're Ghosts.

795
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:44,937
The day of the
final battle WILL come.

796
00:46:45,037 --> 00:46:49,208
It's no use in hoping for
a future where it won't.

797
00:46:49,308 --> 00:46:51,344
The world is an abomination.

798
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:54,781
So do we just run to stay alive,
praying for that last battle?

799
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:56,349
And if so, pray to who?

800
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:59,953
These goddamn butchers
who call themselves gods?!

801
00:47:00,053 --> 00:47:02,390
Artosh, creator of the Fluegel!

802
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:05,193
Kainas, creator of the elves!

803
00:47:05,293 --> 00:47:08,129
Okein, creator of the dwarves!

804
00:47:08,229 --> 00:47:11,099
All of them claim to be the
one true ruler of this world,

805
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,367
fighting for their
precious throne

806
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:16,104
and doing nothing but destroying
everything in the process!

807
00:47:16,204 --> 00:47:20,309
These pieces of shit don't
deserve any of our prayers!

808
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,512
It's time to open your eyes.

809
00:47:23,612 --> 00:47:27,416
We can no longer rely on
hope to save us.

810
00:47:27,517 --> 00:47:32,788
Which is why... we have to
build things up ourselves.

811
00:47:32,888 --> 00:47:36,326
In the end, this world
is nothing but a game.

812
00:47:36,426 --> 00:47:38,561
Those butchers are
after the Suniaster...

813
00:47:38,662 --> 00:47:43,334
a conceptual device said to
grant absolute authority
over this entire world.

814
00:47:43,434 --> 00:47:48,172
Which is why they have
devoted themselves to this
game where anything goes.

815
00:47:48,272 --> 00:47:49,673
And so...

816
00:47:49,774 --> 00:47:52,376
We're gonna make our own rules,
on our own terms.

817
00:47:52,476 --> 00:47:53,878
And then...

818
00:47:53,978 --> 00:47:55,813
We will win.

819
00:47:56,881 --> 00:47:59,617
Number One: No matter what,
you must not kill!

820
00:47:59,717 --> 00:48:02,120
<i>The heart does not wish</i>
<i>for murder....</i>

821
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,357
Number Two: You must let
no one die!

822
00:48:05,457 --> 00:48:07,560
<i>The heart doesn't want</i>
<i>anyone to die...</i>

823
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,329
Number Three: You must let
no one discover you!

824
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,331
<i>If we're discovered,</i>
<i>we're dead.</i>

825
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,201
Number Four: No tactic
is off limits!

826
00:48:15,301 --> 00:48:18,972
<i>Not even the slyest trick</i>
<i>will be considered "dirty."</i>

827
00:48:19,072 --> 00:48:22,742
Number Five: Those guys' rules
mean nothing to us!

828
00:48:22,842 --> 00:48:25,712
<i>The heart doesn't give</i>
<i>two shits about their</i>
<i>bloody contest.</i>

829
00:48:25,812 --> 00:48:29,283
Number Six: Break any of
these rules and you lose.

830
00:48:29,383 --> 00:48:35,423
<i>The heart will gain nothing</i>
<i>from a victory that</i>
<i>violates our principles.</i>

831
00:48:35,523 --> 00:48:39,527
That's it. Now we do
whatever we want.

832
00:48:40,161 --> 00:48:41,830
We are the Ghosts.

833
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,499
We will not kill a single member
of the other races,

834
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:46,267
including the Old Deus.

835
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:49,104
And we will not be discovered!
We are a phantom.

836
00:48:49,204 --> 00:48:53,242
And we will guide the course
of this war to its fruition!

837
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:54,643
That will be our victory!

838
00:48:54,743 --> 00:48:57,614
To finally see the end of
their goddamn war!

839
00:48:57,714 --> 00:49:01,584
Our enemies are gods, with great
tools of violence and despair.

840
00:49:01,684 --> 00:49:04,387
Now, this game was never
meant for us to play.

841
00:49:04,487 --> 00:49:08,658
So winning means we must do
everything in secret
and behind the scenes.

842
00:49:08,758 --> 00:49:11,962
And even if we win,
we can have no memory of it.

843
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:13,597
Because Ghosts don't exist.

844
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:18,702
They just vanish ‐ into
the void, into nothingness.

845
00:49:18,802 --> 00:49:20,238
But know this...

846
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:22,006
If we can do this.

847
00:49:22,106 --> 00:49:25,844
If we can master this game for
real, and if we can win it...

848
00:49:25,944 --> 00:49:29,548
We can... we can die
with our heads high...

849
00:49:29,648 --> 00:49:33,152
cause we lived the coolest,
most bad‐ass lives ever!

850
00:49:33,252 --> 00:49:35,720
[SCHWI]
Oh...

851
00:49:35,821 --> 00:49:37,990
[RIKU]
Okay, if you're willing
to play along.

852
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:41,427
And you're ready to get
started. Then stay here.

853
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:49,703
Uhm... I'm gonna be
honest with you.

854
00:49:49,803 --> 00:49:53,540
No offense, but I really
thought that you guys were
a bit smarter than this.

855
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,810
(Men snickering)
A smart man would've left before
you finished your little speech.

856
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:00,547
Come on now, you didn't
really think there were
any "smart" people left
in the world, did ya?

857
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:04,819
And where else are you ever
gonna find a bunch of
crazier fools than these?

858
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,288
The smart have already
choosen death over this place.

859
00:50:07,389 --> 00:50:10,592
And yet the smartest ones,
didn't bother being born!

860
00:50:10,692 --> 00:50:12,394
You get what you ask for Riku.

861
00:50:12,494 --> 00:50:14,897
You're the one who
chose us remember?

862
00:50:14,997 --> 00:50:16,164
Yeah, that's right!

863
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:17,465
The one who leads
a bunch of dumbasses

864
00:50:17,566 --> 00:50:19,167
is the biggest
dumbass of all!

865
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:20,969
(Laughter)

866
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:23,539
[RIKU]
<i>Yes. Humans are foolish.</i>

867
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:27,176

868
00:50:27,276 --> 00:50:29,045
[SCHWI]
Oof! Oh...!

869
00:50:29,145 --> 00:50:31,948
[RIKU]
<i>We have stayed alive in a world</i>

870
00:50:32,048 --> 00:50:35,585
<i>Everyone has bet it all,</i>
<i>through science and knowledge</i>

871
00:50:35,685 --> 00:50:37,087

874
00:50:44,595 --> 00:50:46,196
Okay, everybody let's do this!

875
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:48,799
Let us pledge upon the wishes
of all our fallen brethren.

876
00:50:48,899 --> 00:50:51,269
[MEN]
Ascheito!

877
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:58,109
[RIKU]
No. Not upon the memories of
the fallen: But the rules
we have vowed to follow.

878
00:50:58,209 --> 00:51:00,579
To everyone here...

879
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:03,048
I pledge Aschento!

880
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:09,656
<i>Okay... Let's get</i>
<i>this game started.</i>

881
00:51:15,094 --> 00:51:18,065
[SCHWI]
Riku... I am now certain.

882
00:51:18,165 --> 00:51:21,101
I do not understand
the human heart.

883
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:23,003
[RIKU]
Hm?

884
00:51:23,103 --> 00:51:25,473
[SCHWI]
All potential strategies have a
less than 1% chance of success.

885
00:51:25,573 --> 00:51:29,577
[RIKU]
And you must be wondering why
everyone's so sure that
we can pull it off?

886
00:51:29,677 --> 00:51:30,979
[SCHWI]
Mm‐hm.

887
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:32,380
[RIKU]
So uh, Schwi...

888
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,216
If you roll a die, what are the
odds it will come up a six?

889
00:51:35,316 --> 00:51:36,651
[SCHWI]
A one in six chance.

890
00:51:36,751 --> 00:51:38,487
[RIKU]
Yeah, maybe so...

891
00:51:38,587 --> 00:51:40,154
But what if someone
who doesn't exist,

892
00:51:40,254 --> 00:51:42,924
swaps it out for a die
that will roll ONLY a six?

893
00:51:43,024 --> 00:51:46,796
[SCHWI]
Uh... You're talking about
manipulation of the variables.

894
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,599
[RIKU]
Yeah. I like to
call it "cheating."

895
00:51:49,699 --> 00:51:51,601
Sounds fun, right?

896
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:54,103
We are the singularity
of the equation.

897
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:57,173
We'll make every prediction,
every strategy and calculation,

898
00:51:57,273 --> 00:52:00,243
come together exactly how
we want it to.

899
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:01,845
If we pull it off, it'll be a‐

900
00:52:01,945 --> 00:52:03,279
[SCHWI]
A miracle.

901
00:52:03,379 --> 00:52:04,481
[RIKU]
Uh?

902
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,016
[SCHWI]
It would be an anomaly.

903
00:52:06,116 --> 00:52:08,685
Success would be a distortion
of probability theory.

904
00:52:08,785 --> 00:52:11,622
[RIKU]
I know...
Anything can happen though.

905
00:52:11,722 --> 00:52:14,491
Zero or 100,
it doesn't really matter...

906
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:16,761
I mean, that's why they
call it a theory right?

907
00:52:16,861 --> 00:52:19,764
Would you like me to
prove it to you?

908
00:52:19,864 --> 00:52:22,167
Question: What are the odds
that, right here and now,

909
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:25,103
I were to profess
my love to you?

910
00:52:25,203 --> 00:52:29,441
[SCHWI]
Intent unclear.
Estimation: Near zero.

911
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:32,077
[RIKU]
Yeah well... You're wrong.

912
00:52:37,483 --> 00:52:40,286
Will you marry me, Schwi?

913
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:50,230
[SCHWI]
Cannot... comprehend. I decline.

914
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:53,100
[RIKU CRYING]
I'M SORRY! I KNOW!
THAT WAS TOO MUCH TOO SOON!

915
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,935
I MEAN I'VE NEVER EVEN
BEEN WITH A GIRL BEFORE!

916
00:52:55,035 --> 00:52:57,271
(Riku crying)
[SCHWI]
Marriage...

917
00:52:57,371 --> 00:53:01,476
A vow of intimacy humans
exchange in order to reproduce.

918
00:53:01,576 --> 00:53:03,611
But Schwi is an Ex Machina.

919
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:05,513

I don't care about that!

920
00:53:05,613 --> 00:53:07,649
I just want you with me forever.

00:53:07,749 --> 00:53:09,718
I just want you to
always be by my side!

922
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:11,853
[SCHWI]
But why? I already am.

923
00:53:11,953 --> 00:53:13,622
[RIKU]
That's not what I mean okay!

924
00:53:13,722 --> 00:53:16,458
I'm talking, like,
as a life partner!

925
00:53:16,558 --> 00:53:18,760

Ex Machina cannot reproduce.

926
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:20,396

I know, I don't care!

927
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:21,898
[SCHWI]
We cannot copulate either.

928
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,467
Riku, you would
always be a virgin.

930
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,869

I don't care about that!

931
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:28,438
[SCHWI]
You hesitated.

932
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,541
[RIKU]
Oh, quit nitpicking
the semantics!

933
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,410

It is not possible.

(Riku gasps)

935
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,313

Can you... still say
what you just said?

Schwi.

947
00:54:23,998 --> 00:54:25,833
I already knew that.

948
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:27,702
Somehow, I already knew.

949
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:29,103
[SCHWI]
Oh!

950
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:31,706
[SCHWI]
But... how's that?

951
00:54:31,806 --> 00:54:35,277
[RIKU]
Well... the first thing that
seemed a little off was...

952

You know... the first moment
we ever met.

953
00:54:38,046 --> 00:54:43,085

chosen to play chess
in the first place? Right?

[SCHWI]
Oh!

955
00:54:44,487 --> 00:54:46,189
[RIKU]
And then, why else
would you just so happen

956
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:48,324
to be sitting there
outside of the settlement?

957
00:54:48,424 --> 00:54:52,128
Heh... Wasn't very well
thought out, was it?

958
00:54:52,228 --> 00:54:54,463
[SCHWI]
Even if that's so... Why...?

959
00:54:54,564 --> 00:54:58,535
[RIKU]
Well... I guess, because
once I knew the whole story...

960
00:54:58,635 --> 00:55:01,171
I kinda fell for you.
What can I say?

961
00:55:01,271 --> 00:55:02,706
[SCHWI]
Uhh!

962
00:55:02,806 --> 00:55:05,976
[RIKU]
Nothing will change the fact
that you wiped out my hometown.

963
00:55:06,076 --> 00:55:10,114
But if not for that,
well then... we probably
never would have met.

Oh...

It is what it is.

took an interest in me

I want to live.

Now, it's "Aschiento."

996
00:56:50,022 --> 00:56:52,457
[COURONNE]
It kinda bugs me that you've
been up to all this
crazy stuff...

997
00:56:52,557 --> 00:56:54,727
without letting me
know anything.

998
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:56,362
Like, what the heck?

999
00:56:56,462 --> 00:56:58,397
You all of the sudden tell me
you have a secret hideout,

1000
00:56:58,497 --> 00:57:00,433
and when I get here,
you're getting married!

1001
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:02,035
I mean, what is that?!

1002
00:57:02,135 --> 00:57:04,137
[RIKU]
Can we just get on with the
stupid ceremony, please?

1003
00:57:04,237 --> 00:57:06,105
You're the one who
said we needed it.

1004
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:09,075
[COURONNE]
Ahem! Do you, Schwi,
take Riku as your husband,

1005
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,711
swearing to grow together,
support and love each other‐?

1006
00:57:11,811 --> 00:57:12,646
[SCHWI]
I swear.

1007
00:57:12,746 --> 00:57:13,580
[COURONNE]
Uh?

1008
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,814
I swear to Riku,

1009
00:57:14,915 --> 00:57:17,417
the one who taught me
why I was born,

1010
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:21,121
and gave me a heart...
I pledge myself.

1011
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:22,990
I will not let you die, Riku.

1012
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:26,227
We will live side by side,
right to the end.

1013
00:57:26,327 --> 00:57:27,195
Aschiento.

1014
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,197
[COURONNE]
Eheheh!

1015
00:57:29,297 --> 00:57:31,700
And so, as your new
"Big Sister..."

1016
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,102
I would like to congratulate
you on your marriage.

1017
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:35,471
[RIKU]
Uh! Wait, Couronne!

1018
00:57:35,571 --> 00:57:36,872
[SCHWI]
Ahh...?

1019
00:57:42,711 --> 00:57:43,780
Uhh...

1020
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,914
[COURONNE]
Ooo... You are so cute!

1021
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:46,448
[RIKU]
Couronne, why are you...?

1022
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:50,019
Well she is the one you chose
as your bride, right Riku?

1023
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:51,721
[RIKU]
Uh!

1024
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:53,056
[COURONNE]
So, in closing,

1025
00:57:53,156 --> 00:57:54,858
you shall carve
your names on this.

1026
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:56,693
[RIKU]
On a rock?

1027
00:57:56,794 --> 00:57:57,995
[COURONNE]
Yes, on a rock.

1028
00:57:58,095 --> 00:57:59,362
If you guys are gonna
live in secret,

1029
00:57:59,462 --> 00:58:00,998
there can be
no official documents.

1030
00:58:01,098 --> 00:58:02,866
[RIKU]
That's your name...

1031
00:58:02,966 --> 00:58:04,502
[COURONNE]
Yes, my surname.

1032
00:58:04,602 --> 00:58:07,872
And from now on, it will be
the same for all three of us.

1033
00:58:07,972 --> 00:58:09,841
[RIKU]
Uh...

1034
00:58:09,941 --> 00:58:11,209
(Laugh)

1035
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:14,278
Feels weird for us
to share a name.

1036
00:58:15,279 --> 00:58:17,816
[COURONNE]
Riku, Schwi...

1037
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:19,851
I don't know what you are...

1038
00:58:19,952 --> 00:58:22,354
what either of you
are planning to do.

1039
00:58:22,454 --> 00:58:25,958
I mean, you two aren't
really part of this world.

1040
00:58:26,058 --> 00:58:27,560
But well...

1041
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,363
I do know I have a
little brother I adore

1042
00:58:30,463 --> 00:58:33,466
and now a gorgeous
younger sister, too.

1043
00:58:33,566 --> 00:58:34,935
So...

1044
00:58:35,035 --> 00:58:39,005
I beg you... be careful
and don't do anything rash.

1045
00:58:39,105 --> 00:58:40,941
I don't want to lose my family!

1046
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:44,445
Yeah. No one is
gonna die, Couronne.

1047
00:58:44,545 --> 00:58:47,849
Because this is one game...
we're sure to win.

1048
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:51,418
You can trust us...
Okay, Big Sister.

1049
00:58:55,757 --> 00:58:56,924
(Warbeasts growling)

1050
00:58:57,024 --> 00:58:59,194
(Grunting)

1051
00:59:03,031 --> 00:59:04,532
(Warbeasts roar)

1052
00:59:04,633 --> 00:59:05,801
(Warbeasts gasp)

1053
00:59:05,901 --> 00:59:08,804
[WARBEAST]
I can smell it... the black ash!

1054
00:59:08,904 --> 00:59:10,839
[ALEI]
Well done, warbeast.

1055
00:59:10,939 --> 00:59:13,476
You can eat me
if you want, but...

1056
00:59:13,576 --> 00:59:17,246
I guarantee you,
I won't taste very good.

1057
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,483
[WARBEAST]
Who the hell are you?!

1058
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:22,319
[ALEI]
Your clan has made the west
coast of the continent
of Lucia your home...

1059
00:59:22,419 --> 00:59:26,590
but the dwarves are planning
to conduct an advanced
weapons test out there.

1060
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:27,657
(Warbeasts snarl)

1061
00:59:27,757 --> 00:59:28,926
[ALEI]
And be warned,

1062
00:59:29,026 --> 00:59:30,394
this thing could even
kill an Old Deus.

1063
00:59:30,494 --> 00:59:32,597
It's a large‐scale explosive
device called an E‐bomb.

1064
00:59:32,697 --> 00:59:34,098
(Warbeasts snarl)

1065
00:59:34,198 --> 00:59:36,834
[ALEI]
Your kind can use
Blood Destruction, yes?

1066
00:59:36,934 --> 00:59:39,637
It could prove useful for you to
get into the dwarves' facility.

1067
00:59:39,737 --> 00:59:44,442
You could make quick work
of it, take care of things
however you like.

1068
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:48,714
[RIKU]
The dwarves' fleet keeps
close watch on the warbeasts

1069
00:59:48,814 --> 00:59:50,382
and then moves into action.

1070
00:59:50,482 --> 00:59:54,686
The warbeasts, fearful of
the E‐bomb, flee Lucia.

1071
00:59:54,787 --> 00:59:59,859
Next, secret elvish information
is leaked to the dwarves.

1072
00:59:59,959 --> 01:00:01,761
And THIS...

1073
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:04,497
is where it all comes together.

1074
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:10,103
[THINK]
Who are you?

1075
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:13,907
[RIKU]
Let's see... I'll just
call myself a Ghost.

1076
01:00:14,007 --> 01:00:19,513
[THINK]
I assume you have business here
that warrants barging into
my home unannounced.

1077
01:00:19,613 --> 01:00:23,151
[RIKU]
I was thinking the two of us
could have a little game.

1078
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:24,653
[THINK]
A game?

1079
01:00:24,753 --> 01:00:27,221
[RIKU]
And the currency we'll
bet with is information.

1080
01:00:27,322 --> 01:00:29,324
If you win,
I'll tell you something.

1081
01:00:29,424 --> 01:00:31,526
If you lose,
you tell me something.

1082
01:00:31,626 --> 01:00:33,728
I don't know who you are
or where you're from...

1083
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:38,167
and yet you think Nina Clive
would just accept
a challenge from you?

1084
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,336
[RIKU]
I'll give you something
up front then:

1085
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:43,639
Information on the Aka Si Anse
has been leaked to the dwarves.

1086
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:44,674
[THINK]
Uh?

1087
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:46,276
[RIKU]
Is that good enough?

1088
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,680
[RIKU]
As the Advocate and Caretaker
of Aka Si Anse Theory,

1089
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:53,817
you should have the ability
to confirm if this information
is valid or not.

1090
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:56,086
Am I mistaken?

1091
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:59,123
[THINK]
Hm, very well.

1092
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:00,557
I may not know who you are,

1093
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,294
but this is something
I cannot ignore.

1094
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:04,862
Therefore, here is my wager:

1095
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:07,265
the Advocate of Aka Si Anse
Theory is in fact‐

1096
01:01:07,365 --> 01:01:08,966
[RIKU]
It's somebody else, right?

1097
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:10,168
[THINK]
Uh...!

1098
01:01:10,268 --> 01:01:11,569
[RIKU]
Yes, I've already heard.

1099
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:12,637
[THINK]
Hm...

1100
01:01:12,737 --> 01:01:14,807
[RIKU]
But I also know
that's not true.

1101
01:01:14,907 --> 01:01:16,108
[THINK]
Mmh?

1102
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,810
[RIKU]
And that you will
resort to magic

1103
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,279
to make me believe
your lie.

1104
01:01:24,117 --> 01:01:27,286
[RIKU]
Now then...
what shall I give you?

1105
01:01:27,386 --> 01:01:30,990
Ah... when the dwarves
learned of the Aka Si Anse,

1106
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,793
they concluded that
it wasn't a threat.

1107
01:01:33,893 --> 01:01:35,462
And I have proof.

1108
01:01:35,562 --> 01:01:38,632
[THINK]
But that's ridiculous.

1109
01:01:38,732 --> 01:01:39,666
[RIKU]
It's true.

1110
01:01:39,766 --> 01:01:40,935
(Think gasps)

1111
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:42,737
[RIKU]
And I have more information...

1112
01:01:42,837 --> 01:01:45,373
the dwarves are in possession
of a weapon of their own.

1113
01:01:45,473 --> 01:01:49,310
And it's even more powerful
than the Aka Si Anse.

1114
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:56,184
[THINK]
The E‐bomb...

1115
01:01:56,284 --> 01:01:59,521
[RIKU]
Yes. A weapon of
tremendous scale.

1116
01:01:59,621 --> 01:02:01,823
One that could wipe out
the entire continent.

1117
01:02:01,923 --> 01:02:04,460
[THINK]
You're saying those
creatures who burrow
in the earth like moles,

1118
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,195
have created something...

1119
01:02:06,295 --> 01:02:08,230
something more advanced
than the Aka Si Anse,

1120
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:11,901
the culmination of
elvish spiritual magic?

1121
01:02:12,001 --> 01:02:13,536
Wait just a moment.

1122
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:18,041
There have been times
that you've chosen to
lose on purpose.

1123
01:02:18,141 --> 01:02:19,609
Let me ask one last thing:

1124
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:23,747
Are you our enemy?
Or are you our ally?

1125
01:02:23,847 --> 01:02:26,484
[RIKU]
I am neither your enemy
nor your ally.

1126
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:29,487
I have but one concern...

1127
01:02:29,587 --> 01:02:33,557
you only suffer as few
casualties as possible.

1128
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,062
[THINK]
Very well, Mr. Ghost.

1129
01:02:38,162 --> 01:02:40,232
To be clear, young man,
I can assume

1130
01:02:40,332 --> 01:02:43,535
you have shared this information
with me alone, yes?

1131
01:02:49,008 --> 01:02:50,576
Oh, and Mr. Ghost...

1132
01:02:50,676 --> 01:02:54,247
I guess I should tell you
my name is not Nina Clive...

1133
01:02:54,347 --> 01:02:57,050
Tee‐hee! Rather my
name is Think Nilvalen.

1134
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:00,353
Did I fool you or did you
already figure it out?

1135
01:03:00,453 --> 01:03:02,989
[RIKU]
Huh, you tell me.

1136
01:03:03,089 --> 01:03:06,393
Did you ever once hear me
call you "Nina"?

1137
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,899
[THINK]
Of course if you know
anything about me,

1138
01:03:11,999 --> 01:03:13,167
I am going to make you regret

1139
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:15,770
ever trying to make me
your plaything.

1140
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:20,007
After all, the rumor that elves
are relentlessly tenacious...

1141
01:03:20,107 --> 01:03:24,847
first began with none other
than the Nilvalen family.

1142
01:03:24,947 --> 01:03:25,781
(Riku grunts)

1143
01:03:25,881 --> 01:03:27,115
[SCHWI]
Riku!

1144
01:03:27,215 --> 01:03:29,117
(Riku groaning and coughing)
Riku, here!

1145
01:03:29,217 --> 01:03:30,653
It's a decontaminant!

1146
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:32,855
(Riku gagging)

1147
01:03:32,955 --> 01:03:34,423
Riku, you lied to me!

1148
01:03:34,523 --> 01:03:36,325
You said it would
only be an hour!

1149
01:03:36,425 --> 01:03:39,896
You've been breathing black ash
for twice that time!

1150
01:03:39,996 --> 01:03:41,731
(Riku coughs)

1151
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:46,670
(Riku coughing)

1152
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:48,605
[RIKU]
I didn't have a choice.

1153
01:03:48,705 --> 01:03:52,342
I had to, or I would've
given myself away.

1154
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:54,645
I had to do it.

1155
01:03:54,745 --> 01:03:58,115
And besides... I don't care
how smart you are...

1156
01:03:58,215 --> 01:04:02,453
no one could predict this sort
of suicidal behavior, right?

1157
01:04:03,321 --> 01:04:04,990
(Riku grunting)

1158
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:06,457
[SCHWI]
Riku!

1159
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:09,160
(Riku weak chuckling)

1160
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,397
Looks like this may be
it for me, huh?

1161
01:04:11,497 --> 01:04:12,864
[SCHWI]
Mmph...

1162
01:04:12,964 --> 01:04:17,469
[RIKU]
So... How much longer
do you think I've got?

1163
01:04:17,569 --> 01:04:20,539
[SCHWI]
Riku, I won't let you die.

1164
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,010
You have to stay alive
until I die.

1165
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,414
[RIKU]
Oh yeah, and how long
do Ex Machina live?

1166
01:04:27,514 --> 01:04:30,918
[SCHWI]
I have another 892 years
in my service life.

1167
01:04:31,018 --> 01:04:32,152
[RIKU]
Huh?

1168
01:04:32,252 --> 01:04:33,453
(laughs)

1169
01:04:33,553 --> 01:04:36,757
Guess I'll have to
step up my game, won't I?

1170
01:04:38,892 --> 01:04:41,729
[RIKU]
<i>And so, the first objective</i>
<i>was achieved...</i>

1171
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:47,501
<i>moving the violent battle</i>
<i>lines outside of the</i>
<i>human territories.</i>

1172
01:04:47,602 --> 01:04:50,271
[LILY]
Look at this. First the dwarves,
and now the elves.

1173
01:04:50,372 --> 01:04:53,308
Even the warbeasts are
leaving in droves.

1174
01:04:53,408 --> 01:04:55,577
What's going on?

1175
01:04:55,677 --> 01:04:57,312
[COURONNE]
Uh... Lily!

1176
01:04:57,412 --> 01:04:59,214
Keep an eye on things for me!
I'll be back!

1177
01:04:59,314 --> 01:05:01,917
[LILY]
Oh...? Huh? Hey! Couronne!

1178
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:07,022
[RIKU]
<i>The Ghosts continued to take</i>
<i>action from behind the scenes.</i>

1179
01:05:07,123 --> 01:05:11,661
<i>And just like we wanted,</i>
<i>the elves eventually became</i>
<i>allies with the fairies</i>

1180
01:05:11,762 --> 01:05:14,731
<i>and moved to ramp up their</i>
<i>contracts with the dragonia</i>

1181
01:05:14,831 --> 01:05:16,900
<i>in order to fend off</i>
<i>the dwarvish fleet.</i>

1182
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,070
<i>Meanwhile, the dwarves became</i>
<i>allies with the gigants,</i>

1183
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:24,241
<i>as well as several phantasma,</i>
<i>who were all on friendly terms.</i>

1184
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:26,210
<i>Manipulated by the</i>
<i>Ghosts' information,</i>

1185
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:29,046
<i>each of the major powers took</i>
<i>steps to guard against</i>

1186
01:05:29,146 --> 01:05:31,816
<i>the large‐scale destructive</i>
<i>weaponry of the other,</i>

1187
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:35,820
<i>moving their headquarters</i>
<i>to the neighboring</i>
<i>continent of Ariela.</i>

1188
01:05:35,921 --> 01:05:38,523
<i>And well, that just so happened</i>
<i>to be the home base</i>

1189
01:05:38,623 --> 01:05:40,926
<i>for what was currently</i>
<i>the greatest threat of all:</i>

1190
01:05:41,026 --> 01:05:46,632
<i>The lord of the Fluegel,</i>
<i>the Old Deus... Artosh.</i>

1191
01:05:49,235 --> 01:05:50,703
[SCHWI]
Einweg.

1192
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,241
Twenty‐three units
are now installed.

1193
01:05:55,341 --> 01:05:57,444
That leaves...
nine remaining.

1194
01:05:57,544 --> 01:06:03,050
[RIKU]
<i>And so, as each of the other</i>
<i>races sought to take advantage</i>
<i>of this situation,</i>

1195
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:07,421
<i>the clock began ticking down</i>
<i>to the world's final battle...</i>

1196
01:06:08,122 --> 01:06:10,691
Exactly like we wanted.

1197
01:06:13,128 --> 01:06:17,265
[RIKU]
Hey, Schwi... of all the gods,
is there a god of games?

1198
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:18,599
[SCHWI]
Huh?

1199
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,068
[RIKU]
And if, uh...

1200
01:06:20,168 --> 01:06:24,205
if I told you I'd met him,
would you believe me?

1201
01:06:24,306 --> 01:06:27,776
The stuff he does,
it's way beyond anything
I can anticipate,

1202
01:06:27,876 --> 01:06:31,413
so of course I lose to him
every single time.

1203
01:06:31,513 --> 01:06:32,715
And yet...

1204
01:06:32,815 --> 01:06:35,017
It's so much fun
that I can't stand it.

1205
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:38,955
And it's like...
I just know that I can
beat him the next time.

1206
01:06:39,055 --> 01:06:42,159
I've been thinking about that
since this whole thing started..

1207
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:43,626
And I have to do it...

1208
01:06:43,727 --> 01:06:46,530
I have to settle things
with him once and for all...

1209
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:51,001
because that game of ours
isn't over yet.

1210
01:06:51,101 --> 01:06:57,008
[SCHWI]
If you believe this,
well then, I believe it too.

1211
01:06:57,108 --> 01:06:58,442
[RIKU]
Uh...!

1212
01:06:58,542 --> 01:07:01,513
[SCHWI]
If you say he exists,
then he does.

1213
01:07:01,613 --> 01:07:04,216
I do not doubt you.

1214
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:07,719
Oh, come on!
Are you kidding me!

1215
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:10,222
Why isn't someone here
to hear you say that!

1216
01:07:10,322 --> 01:07:12,157
They'll never believe me!

1217
01:07:12,257 --> 01:07:14,560
[SCHWI]
Oh! Oh, Riku!

1218
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:15,628
(Riku groans)

1219
01:07:15,728 --> 01:07:16,929
[COURONNE]
Riku!

1220
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:17,863
[SCHWI]
Oh?

1221
01:07:17,963 --> 01:07:19,199
(Couronne breathing heavy)

1222
01:07:19,299 --> 01:07:20,866
[RIKU]
Couronne!

1223
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:26,740
[COURONNE]
It's just like you said:
we haven't lost a single
person to the war.

1224
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,411
And sightings of the other
races have dried up too.

1225
01:07:30,511 --> 01:07:32,179
[RIKU]
Yeah, I bet.

1226
01:07:32,279 --> 01:07:34,949
[COURONNE]
Well, if you two are the ones
behind all of this,

1227
01:07:35,049 --> 01:07:38,085
then I'd say that you were doing
something pretty amazing.

1228
01:07:38,185 --> 01:07:39,587
But dammit, Riku!

1229
01:07:39,687 --> 01:07:42,357
Look at the shape you're in?
You need to be more careful.

1230
01:07:42,457 --> 01:07:43,558
[RIKU]
It's not a problem.

1231
01:07:43,658 --> 01:07:45,127
[COURONNE]
It's a BIG problem, Riku!

1232
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,595
You're falling apart!

1233
01:07:47,695 --> 01:07:50,065
[RIKU]
We're almost there, okay?

1234
01:07:50,165 --> 01:07:52,901
Just leave me be.

1235
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:56,605
[COURONNE]
But when is "almost"?
I want it to be over?

1236
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:59,675
How long do I have to
keep worrying about you?

1237
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,978
(Couronne starts crying)

1238
01:08:04,881 --> 01:08:07,283
[RIKU]
Listen to me, Couronne...

1239
01:08:07,384 --> 01:08:10,520
Do you know what the gods are
after with this war of theirs?

1240
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,988
[COURONNE]
Uh...?

1241
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:14,324
[SCHWI]
The throne of the One True God.

1242
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,793
[RIKU]
Yup. According to Schwi,

1243
01:08:15,893 --> 01:08:19,196
it's something they refer to
as the Suniaster.

1244
01:08:19,296 --> 01:08:22,032
It's a kind of
conceptual device.

1245
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:25,903
And it was designed so that
out of all those big, fancy
Old Deus idiots,

1246
01:08:26,004 --> 01:08:28,206
only one of them
can be called "God."

1247
01:08:28,306 --> 01:08:29,975
[COURONNE]
"Conceptual device"?

1248
01:08:30,075 --> 01:08:32,678
How are you ever suppose to
find something like that?

1249
01:08:32,778 --> 01:08:35,514
[SCHWI]
It will appear only
under one condition:

1250
01:08:35,614 --> 01:08:40,052
it must manifest itself
in front of the absolute
greatest power on the planet.

1251
01:08:40,152 --> 01:08:43,022
[RIKU]
And if there are ten gods
out there of equal power...

1252
01:08:43,122 --> 01:08:45,625
they will eventually
kill all the other nine

1253
01:08:45,725 --> 01:08:48,361
making whoever's left
their One True God.

1254
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:50,263
That's their twisted way
of thinking.

1255
01:08:50,363 --> 01:08:52,699
[COURONNE]
What?! Then they're morons!

1256
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,302
So that's the reason
we've been...?

1257
01:08:55,402 --> 01:08:58,872
[RIKU]
Couronne, they're even
dumber than you think.

1258
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:01,141
Listen to this...

1259
01:09:01,241 --> 01:09:02,876
Their precious Suniaster,

1260
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:05,646
we can make it show up without
going through all that trouble.

1261
01:09:05,746 --> 01:09:07,648
[COURONNE]
Huh?

1262
01:09:07,748 --> 01:09:10,985
[RIKU]
And that's why I've gathered all
these handsome fellows together.

1263
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:13,254
The Aka Si Anse,

1264
01:09:13,354 --> 01:09:14,556
the E‐bomb,

1265
01:09:14,656 --> 01:09:16,090
the Heaven's Strike...

1266
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:17,959
They're powerful enough
on their own,

1267
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,794
but when put together
in one area...

1268
01:09:19,895 --> 01:09:21,864
They could blast a hole...

1269
01:09:21,964 --> 01:09:23,298
right through the planet.

1270
01:09:23,398 --> 01:09:24,934
Huh? The planet?!

1271
01:09:25,034 --> 01:09:28,170
All the Old Deus were originally
born from this world...

1272
01:09:28,271 --> 01:09:30,806
they all came from
the Spirit Circuit.

1273
01:09:30,906 --> 01:09:34,477
Which means the greatest power
in the whole wide world
is actually...?

1274
01:09:34,577 --> 01:09:36,680
Ump! The Spirit Circuit!

1275
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:38,148
[RIKU]
We may be the weakest,

1276
01:09:38,248 --> 01:09:40,283
but we've set the stage
for the final scene.

1277
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:42,653
We're gonna to use their
own strength against them

1278
01:09:42,753 --> 01:09:46,390
and turn the global balance
of power on its baffled
little head.

1279
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:50,194
The Suniaster will appear,
and once it is acquired,

1280
01:09:50,294 --> 01:09:53,998
the One True God will be named,
and the planet will be rebuilt.

1281
01:09:54,098 --> 01:09:56,768
This operation will be
an all‐out assault,

1282
01:09:56,868 --> 01:09:59,271
so it must be done
using Schwi's weaponry,

1283
01:09:59,371 --> 01:10:01,907
which can skew power
directionality.

1284
01:10:02,007 --> 01:10:03,876
[SCHWI]
It will be an amalgam
of influence.

1285
01:10:03,976 --> 01:10:06,879
Installing 32 Einweg units
should, in theory,

1286
01:10:06,979 --> 01:10:09,948
allow us to wield enough raw
power to destroy the planet.

1287
01:10:10,048 --> 01:10:12,818
[RIKU]
There are nine installation
sites left.

1288
01:10:12,919 --> 01:10:14,653
And once everything is set up...

1289
01:10:14,754 --> 01:10:17,223
[RIKU &amp; SCHWI]
It'll be checkmate.

1290
01:10:17,323 --> 01:10:18,625
(Couronne gasps)

1291
01:10:18,725 --> 01:10:20,594
[RIKU]
Those fools will pierce
the planet's core themselves,

1292
01:10:20,694 --> 01:10:24,631
and we'll be there to snatch
the Suniaster right under
their noses.

1293
01:10:24,731 --> 01:10:27,134
And we'll do it without
anyone dying...

1294
01:10:27,234 --> 01:10:30,638
so when this over,
I wanna ask these gods...

1295
01:10:30,738 --> 01:10:31,739
[SCHWI]
Ohh...

1296
01:10:31,839 --> 01:10:33,207
"Hey there, how you doing?

1297
01:10:33,308 --> 01:10:35,776
Do you like losing?
How does that feel?"

1298
01:10:35,876 --> 01:10:37,145
[SCHWI]
Riku?

1299
01:10:37,245 --> 01:10:39,714
[COURONNE &amp; SCHWI]
Riku!

1300
01:10:44,753 --> 01:10:47,856
(Riku groans)

1301
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:50,226
Riku!

1302
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:54,063
[RIKU]
Uhhh...

1303
01:10:54,163 --> 01:10:56,766
[RIKU]
What did you tell them all
before you came here?

1304
01:10:56,866 --> 01:11:00,503
[COURONNE]
Huh? Uh...

1305
01:11:00,603 --> 01:11:02,038
Nothing, really.

1306
01:11:02,139 --> 01:11:05,208
[RIKU]
I bet the colony is
in an absolute panic.

1307
01:11:05,308 --> 01:11:08,111
Don't let them be
on their own for too long.

1308
01:11:08,211 --> 01:11:09,947
[COURONNE]
Hm! What's going on?!

1309
01:11:10,047 --> 01:11:13,651
You suddenly left
without saying anything...

1310
01:11:13,751 --> 01:11:15,319
and you never...!

1311
01:11:15,419 --> 01:11:19,457
Take care of Nonna and
the others. They need you.

1312
01:11:32,905 --> 01:11:35,174
[SCHWI]
Riku. Just sleep.

1313
01:11:35,274 --> 01:11:38,978
[RIKU]
I can't. We have to hurry and
finish setting up the Einweg.

1314
01:11:39,078 --> 01:11:40,713
[SCHWI]
It can wait.

1315
01:11:40,813 --> 01:11:43,083
The attack will not be
starting anytime soon.

1316
01:11:43,183 --> 01:11:45,751
Your predictions
are never wrong.

1317
01:11:45,852 --> 01:11:47,087
[RIKU]
Yeah, but...! (grunt)

1318
01:11:47,187 --> 01:11:49,723
[SCHWI]
You can rest for a little while.

1319
01:11:49,823 --> 01:11:53,827
You should... take a day off.

1320
01:11:53,927 --> 01:11:55,896
(Riku exhales)

1321
01:11:57,298 --> 01:11:59,233
[RIKU]
Hmm.. You're right.

1322
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:03,370
I can probably use some time
to get my strength back up.

1323
01:12:03,471 --> 01:12:06,207
[SCHWI]
Yes.

1324
01:12:06,308 --> 01:12:11,313
[RIKU]
Um, Schwi... I'm sorry for
being such a burden.

1325
01:12:11,413 --> 01:12:14,883
[SCHWI]
Riku, please just sleep now.
You're not a burden.

1326
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:17,420
(Riku deep breath)

1327
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,657
Then, Schwi...
I have a favor to ask you.

1328
01:12:21,757 --> 01:12:23,092
[SCHWI]
Huh?

1329
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:26,195
[RIKU]
Could you...
hold my hand while I sleep?

1330
01:12:26,295 --> 01:12:27,330
[SCHWI]
Huh?

1331
01:12:30,366 --> 01:12:32,101
[SCHWI]
Mm‐hm.

1332
01:12:32,201 --> 01:12:36,506
I will hold your hand
for as long as you need.

1333
01:12:36,606 --> 01:12:37,975
Don't worry, Riku.

1334
01:12:38,075 --> 01:12:40,644
(Riku exhales)

1335
01:12:40,745 --> 01:12:44,849
[RIKU]
Schwi, thank you for
coming into my life.

1336
01:12:44,949 --> 01:12:47,518
I mean it.

1337
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:52,457
I really do...
love you so much.

1338
01:12:52,557 --> 01:12:54,993
Forever and ever.

1339
01:13:10,543 --> 01:13:14,181
Riku... I'm sorry.

1340
01:13:15,415 --> 01:13:17,550
I'll be back...

1341
01:13:18,351 --> 01:13:19,687
I'll be back.

1342
01:13:19,787 --> 01:13:23,123
[AZRIEL]
The elves have
the Aka Si Anse...

1343
01:13:23,223 --> 01:13:25,125
The dwarves have
their E‐bomb.

1344
01:13:25,225 --> 01:13:27,328
Hm, but...
they're both still weak,

1345
01:13:27,428 --> 01:13:29,030
and yet challenging
Lord Artosh!

1346
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,732
The fools should get
squashed! Nya! Ah!

1347
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,201
(Azriel moaning and groaning)

1348
01:13:33,301 --> 01:13:35,203
[RAFAEL]
You're the one being
foolish, Azriel.

1349
01:13:35,303 --> 01:13:38,272
We can't afford to make any
brazen moves ourselves.

1350
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:41,176
Lord Artosh is awaiting
the right opportunity,

1351
01:13:41,276 --> 01:13:43,678
and so we must wait as well.

1352
01:13:43,778 --> 01:13:44,914
[JIBRIL]
Mph...

1353
01:13:45,014 --> 01:13:48,283
Rather tedious, isn't it?

1354
01:13:52,154 --> 01:13:54,724
(Device buzzes)

1355
01:13:54,824 --> 01:13:58,094
[SCHWI]
Eight more.

1356
01:13:58,194 --> 01:14:02,198
<i>If I acquire the Suniaster,</i>
<i>then Riku will not die!</i>

1357
01:14:02,298 --> 01:14:04,735
Riku, just hold on!

1358
01:14:04,835 --> 01:14:05,936
[JIBRIL]
Well now...

1359
01:14:06,036 --> 01:14:07,571
(Schwi gasps)

1360
01:14:07,671 --> 01:14:10,741
[JIBRIL]
Are you out here all by yourself
on this lovely day?

1361
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:12,543
(Schwi gasps)

1362
01:14:12,643 --> 01:14:15,312
[JIBRIL]
I observed faint readings
of spiritual energy,

1363
01:14:15,412 --> 01:14:17,549
so I came to investigate,
and well...

1364
01:14:17,649 --> 01:14:21,353
what a most unexpected
bounty it has yielded me.

1365
01:14:23,388 --> 01:14:26,558
Some glorious scrap.
A pleasure to meet you.

1366
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:40,139
[SCHWI]
Warning: Hostile action against
this unit will trigger
appropriate countermeasures.

1367
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:44,944
From a single Prufer unit?
Isn't that cute.

1368
01:14:45,044 --> 01:14:47,614
I have confirmed there are
no Cluster readings

1369
01:14:47,714 --> 01:14:49,649
within a 100‐kilometer radius.

1370
01:14:49,749 --> 01:14:51,318
No one is coming to help you,

1371
01:14:51,418 --> 01:14:53,153
so I'd say this is
a wonderful chance

1372
01:14:53,253 --> 01:14:55,289
to remove that charming
little head of yours.

1373
01:14:55,389 --> 01:14:58,526
[SCHWI]
Number 1: You must not
kill anyone.

1374
01:14:58,626 --> 01:15:01,062
[JIBRIL]
Luckily for you, Ex Machina
have no understanding

1375
01:15:01,162 --> 01:15:03,031
of the concept
of death, do they?

1376
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,533
[SCHWI]
Number 2: You must let
no one die.

1377
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:07,636
[JIBRIL]
There's really no use
in resisting, and so‐

1378
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:08,670
[SCHWI]
I refuse.

1379
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,205
[JIBRIL]
Pardon?

1380
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:13,242
[SCHWI]
This unit has been abandoned.
It has no worth.

1381
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,479
Number 6: Break any of
these rules and you lose.

1382
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:19,415
Therefore...

1383
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,851
[SCHWI]
I'd like you to... drop this.

1384
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:23,085
[JIBRIL]
Ohh!

1385
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,355
Don't tell me an Ex Machina

1386
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:27,424
is pleading for its life
out of a fear of death.

1387
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:30,460
Oh, so then you're a defect,
cast out from your
own collective!

1388
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,696
Oh, you are a
premium catch, indeed!

1389
01:15:32,796 --> 01:15:35,298
I cannot believe what a prize
I have stumbled upon!

1390
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:37,768
What a treat this is! Hahaha!

1391
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:40,571
[SCHWI]

1393
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:50,282

1397
01:16:03,596 --> 01:16:05,030
Final warning:

01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:09,435
All armaments, firepower,
and combat maneuvers
shall be employed...

1399
01:16:09,535 --> 01:16:12,472
And you will
beg for your life.

1400
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,376
[JIBRIL]
Oh, no! How precious...

1401
01:16:15,476 --> 01:16:17,644
I thought Ex Machina were
designed and constructed

1402
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:21,115
to parse and emulate the most
optimal methods of destruction.

1403
01:16:21,215 --> 01:16:22,749
Hehe... I'm sorry sweetie,

1404
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:25,152
but I think someone
has played a joke on you.

1405
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:27,354
[SCHWI]
Over Boost!

1406
01:16:35,263 --> 01:16:36,664

Hahaha!

[JIBRIL]
Scattering the
elemental bones...

1409
01:16:53,116 --> 01:16:56,753
As a machine, I suppose you're
not very kind to the
environment, are you? However...

1410
01:16:56,853 --> 01:16:59,423
I might be able to do
something about that!

1411
01:16:59,523 --> 01:17:02,726
[SCHWI]
Your conviction is... unfounded.

1412
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,194
(Jibril gasps)

1413
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:08,533
[SCHWI]
Losen! Ender Apokryphen!

1414
01:17:09,267 --> 01:17:10,601
[JIBRIL]
Ohh!

1415
01:17:19,377 --> 01:17:20,879
[SCHWI]
Einweg.

1416
01:17:20,979 --> 01:17:23,649
I should continue my escape
until having reached a distance

1417
01:17:23,749 --> 01:17:26,318
where the Flugel cannot
detect me. That should work.

1418
01:17:26,418 --> 01:17:28,487
[JIBRIL] Oh, is that right?
(Schwi gasps)

1419
01:17:28,587 --> 01:17:31,057
[JIBRIL]
And just what do you have
in mind next?

1420
01:17:31,157 --> 01:17:32,525
[SCHWI]
Ah!

1421
01:17:35,695 --> 01:17:37,197
Uhh!

1422
01:17:41,268 --> 01:17:42,936
Uhh...

1423
01:17:43,036 --> 01:17:46,273
[JIBRIL]
Oh, dear. I thought I
was targeting the neck.

1424
01:17:46,373 --> 01:17:49,109
Perhaps my aim was
a little bit off?

1425
01:17:49,209 --> 01:17:50,878
[SCHWI]
Uh... Uhhh...

1426
01:17:50,978 --> 01:17:52,913
[JIBRIL]
Because obviously,
I can't imagine a machine

1427
01:17:53,014 --> 01:17:55,683
would have anything close
to resembling intuition.

1428
01:17:55,784 --> 01:17:58,286
Anyway, this is
growing tiresome.

1429
01:17:58,386 --> 01:18:00,755
All I need from you
is your adorable head,

1430
01:18:00,855 --> 01:18:02,891
The rest of you
I will bury in the dirt,

1431
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:05,894

scrap metal belongs.

01:20:29,085 --> 01:20:32,789
It is the "heart" Riku gave me,

Are you trying to imply
something with those

1498
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:26,747
A bit audacious, but brilliantly

I never told you my name.

I apologize for

It was shamefully crass, but...

I have deemed your presence

(Riku gasps)

1580
01:26:55,834 --> 01:26:57,870
You must let no one die.

1581
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:00,339

The conditions of failure...

1583
01:27:02,174 --> 01:27:06,212
They do not apply to
the loss of a tool.

1584
01:27:06,312 --> 01:27:09,582
They do not apply to
the loss of Schwi.

1585
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:11,017
[RIKU]
Huh...?

1586
01:27:11,117 --> 01:27:15,789
[SCHWI]
This makes check, Riku.

1587
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:21,528
The rest is up to you.

1588
01:27:21,628 --> 01:27:26,701
[EINZIG]
Allow me to provide you with
some additional information.

1589
01:27:26,801 --> 01:27:29,370
[EINZIG]
First off: Given that
the various races

1590
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:32,240
have gathered near the
Einweg installation points,

1591
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:36,344
any movement on our part
will be immediately detected
by the Cluster,

1592
01:27:36,444 --> 01:27:40,382
with a 98% probability that
we will engage in battle.

1593
01:27:40,482 --> 01:27:44,620
Thus, only the 24 Einwegs
currently installed can be used,

1594
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:50,292
meaning it will not be possible
to draw the energy downward
and into the planet.

1595
01:27:50,392 --> 01:27:51,461
(Riku angrily grunting)

1596
01:27:51,561 --> 01:27:53,029
However, it will be possible

1597
01:27:53,129 --> 01:27:55,198
to guide guide
the enegy southwest.

1598
01:27:55,298 --> 01:27:56,866
[RIKU]
Huh?

1599
01:27:56,966 --> 01:27:59,436
[EINZIG]
Second: We Ex Machina are
able to deploy weaponry

1600
01:27:59,536 --> 01:28:04,942
and this weaponry can be used
to analyze and replicate
any attack that is incurred.

1601
01:28:05,042 --> 01:28:08,212
Spieler Riku, you will take
control of this weaponry

1602
01:28:08,312 --> 01:28:10,648
and use it to drill
into the planet.

1603
01:28:10,748 --> 01:28:13,384
Allowing you to
manifest the Suniaster.

1604
01:28:13,484 --> 01:28:17,856
Ex Machina are but machines,
mere tools bereft of "heart."

1605
01:28:17,956 --> 01:28:20,325
We are designed to
complete a purpose.

1606
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:23,528
And must carry out
the orders we are given.

1607
01:28:23,628 --> 01:28:29,368
As such... Now, Spieler Riku,
I shall aid you in your purpose.

1608
01:28:29,468 --> 01:28:31,771
Your orders, please.

1609
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:33,339
(Riku sobs)

1610
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:35,208
Schwi!

1611
01:28:37,377 --> 01:28:38,778
I understand.

1612
01:28:38,879 --> 01:28:44,284
The rules do not include...
the loss of a "tool."

1613
01:28:44,384 --> 01:28:48,889
Schwi! If this is
what you wish...

1614
01:28:48,989 --> 01:28:53,627
Then I wish to do
whatever you wish.

But I still can't help but
wonder what the piece of
junk was up to.

Lord Artosh!

1638
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:11,578
[ARTOSH]
I have grown tired
of this charade

1639
01:30:11,678 --> 01:30:13,847
and now I must respond.

1640
01:30:13,947 --> 01:30:19,052

01:40:28,976 --> 01:40:31,211
She was the pride of
the Dola family.

1815
01:40:31,311 --> 01:40:33,040
[SHIRO]
And who are the other two?

1816
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:35,710
[STEPHANIE]
Oh, um... I have no idea.

1817
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:37,900
[JIBRIL]
"Schwi", huh...?

1818
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,633
That scrumptious little creature
was not a part of Imanity.

1819
01:40:41,733 --> 01:40:43,300
[IZUNA]
Mph...

1820
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:47,233
[IZUNA]
I feel like I've heard
that name before. Thanks.

1821
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:48,667
[SORA &amp; SHIRO]
Huh?

1822
01:40:48,767 --> 01:40:53,633
[IZUNA]
At least... I think so.

1823
01:40:53,733 --> 01:40:57,533
[TET]
As it turns out,
the world really isn't
all that complicated.

1824
01:40:57,633 --> 01:41:00,800
It's pretty simple, actually.

1825
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:04,267
It's all just a game,
a very simple game.

1826
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:07,200
'Course some will try
to make it difficult...

1827
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,733
but you can handle them,
I know you it.

1828
01:41:09,833 --> 01:41:11,867
I know you can!

1829
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:26,900
[SORA]
Now...

1830
01:41:29,433 --> 01:41:32,500
[SORA &amp; SHIRO]
Let's get this game started.

Goodnight, Romeo.

Why would you
commit these crimes?

29

You can start by
telling me who you are.

I suggest you agree
to my demands.

35
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,583
What demands?

36
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,208
Hm? What's wrong?

37
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:58,500

You could've at least
mentioned it first.

her a few things.

[SHIBAZAKI]
Right. Jeez. She's so grown up.

[SHIBAZAKI]
Hm? No.

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,833
Weirdo.

Just keeping an eye on you
so I can come with

51
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,875
when you go see Mamiya.

52
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,250
And if anything happens?

53
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,291
Fine. I'm prepared
for the worst.

54
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,708
[SHIBAZAKI]
Then I have an important request

55
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,750
to make of you.

56
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,750
Sure!

57
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,875
[SHIBAZAKI]
Buy me some cigarettes.

58
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:41,875
[HAMURA]
What?

59
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,208
[SHIBAZAKI]
It's a superstition.

00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,458
When I feel like I'm about
to hit on something big,

61
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,791
there's a brand I always smoke.

62
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,166
Right.

63
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,833
[INSPECTOR GENERAL]
A press conference?

64
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,458
[FUKUDA] What could
he wanna talk about?

65
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,625
[SHIMADA]
I don't know.

66
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,416
He just said that
it should be at 8 PM,

67
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,083
and requested that we gather
all the different news outlets.

68
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,708
If we don't hold this thing.

69
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,708
I'm afraid this kid will
actually set off an atomic bomb.

70
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,208
So you plan to negotiate
with a terrorist?

71
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,583
[KURAHASHI] I plan to think
of the safety of our citizens.

72
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,583
He said as long as
we give him this,

73
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,583
he'll turn the bomb
over to the police.

74
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,958
We can't trust 'im!

75
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,291

They have kept their promises

76

in every crime announcement
they've made so far.

77
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,625
But this is different.

78
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,083
It's the first time they're
making a demand.

00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,333
[CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY]
And?

80
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,000
If he's lying and the
worst were to happen?

81
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,125

I'll be accountable.

86
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,083
I'd like to speak
with Shunzo Mamiya.

[ASSISTANT 10A] I'm sorry,
but he's not receiving

00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,458
any visitors at this time.

[SHIBAZAKI]
Please tell him I'm here

that disappeared.

of Shinsei, please.

don't have 'em.

This is the eighth
place I've tried.

[MAMIYA] You want the truth.
But are you prepared to hear it?

[SHIBAZAKI]
Damn right.

98
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,583
I imagine your resolve
must be strong

99
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,125
if it brought you
here to see me.

100
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,875
Yes, and after 15
long years, at that.

101

I'm sure you don't
remember me, but,

102
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,458
I have quite the personal
grudge to settle with you, too.

103
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,500
You may leave us.

[CLARENCE]
I don't know the details.

105
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,083
All the locals said
was that the suspect

106
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,708
had turned himself in.

107

a case like yours before.

so try to take it easy.

He's mine. I won't let
anyone else have him.

[MAMIYA]
You're just a youngster.

112
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,458
So, you probably
can't imagine it,

113
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,666
but Tokyo used to
be a burnt field.

114
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,083
It's been almost 70 years.

115
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,291
70 years since the end
of that damned war.

116
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:52,541
However, this country
remains a defeated one.

117
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,833
Even now our spirit
is that of a loser,

118
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:58,250
no shred of dignity left,
and no pride left

119
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,083
to stand up to anyone.

120
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,208
This country must become
truly independent once more.

121
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,125
[SHIBAZAKI] So that's why you
implemented the Athena Plan.

122
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,666
[MAMIYA]
Exactly.

123
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,208
To artificially create
humans whose intelligence

124
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,000
and sensitivity surpass
that of ordinary people.

125
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,291
To raise personnel more
useful than any weapon.

126
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,250
To win, again.
That was the goal.

127
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,083
The plan was
considered a failure.

128
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,958
But if you ask my opinion,
it became a fine foundation

129
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,041
for the country.

130
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,000
A fine foundation?
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,416
Most of those poor
orphans were killed.

132
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,875
And two who lived
are now terrorists.

133
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,333
[SHIBAZAKI] Sphinx came
back to commit patricide.

134
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,291
Their goal is to kill you all.

135
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,458
So they took the last
thing you expected,

136
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:51,208
and the last thing you want the
rest of the world to know about.

137
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,125
[CLARENCE] We need to prove
that when this country's

138
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,416
constitutional
interpretation changed,

139
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,875
they started secretly
producing atomic weapons.

140
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,291
It's imperative we
secure the target alive.

141
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,083
That's the only way
to get our evidence.

142

Please do not forget that.

[MAMIYA] Allow me to ask you,
since you know so much.

144
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,750
Do you plan to bring
this to the authorities?

145
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,791
You realize, no matter what
a single detective shouts,

146
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:23,500
it'll be no more than a tiny
voice in a storm of noise.

147
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,333
It will be swallowed up.

148
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,708
The voice will never
reach a single soul.

149
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,333
Even if you're right,

150
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,875
I'll continue to
shout the truth.

this one. None of you will.

172
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,541
Even within the department,
only a select few

173
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,916
have access to the suspect.

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,291
Can't you do something?
I know him better

175
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,333
--than anyone else!
--[KURAHASHI] Shibazaki!

176
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,458
I'm taking care of this.

177
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,083
He specified the
conference's location.

178
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,625
Any idea what he
wants to talk about?

179
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,125
[SHIBAZAKI]
You'll likely have interference

180
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,166
from different quarters.

181
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,125
No matter what happens,
do not let anyone else have him.

182
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,458
Yeah.

183
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,125
What's that?

184
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,750
[KURAHASHI] The location
of the press conference.

185
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,958
You "found" that note.
Stumbled across it.

186
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,375
[HAMURA] It's a trap,
no matter how you look at it!

187
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,708
[OKANO] There's always
an ulterior motive

188
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,125
when they turn 'emselves in.

189
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,875
Besides, there are two perps.
Where's the other one?

190
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,458
Yeah, right?
Y'guys think he'll bomb

191
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,625
the press conference
or somethin'?

192
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,375
Hey, you smokin' now?

193
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,916
No, probably not.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,833
I bet our guys
are ready for that.

195
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,208
[HAMURA] Come on, we should
at least mention it, though.

196
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,083
[OKANO] How? We're all
suspended, remember?

197
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,000
We walk in there and tell
them before it's too late!

198
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,541
[HAMURA]
Here, take 'em!

199
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,208
Why the hell didn't
you wait for me?

200
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,083
Because you were
takin' too damn long.

201
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,583
You met with Mamiya,
didn't you?

202
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,208
[SHIBAZAKI]
Yeah.

203
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,291
I'm gonna follow this through
to the end, no matter the cost.

204
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:24,541
But there's something
I still need to see first.

205
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,916
Their future.
With my own eyes.

206
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,458
[INSPECTOR GENERAL]
I told you. Only the Japanese

207
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,958
police are being allowed
to escort him there.

208
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,875
That's the Sphinx boy's
demand, not mine.

209
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,083
[CLARENCE]
I see.

210
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,125
You comply with the
demands of a terrorist,

211
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,416
and yet refuse the
American government?

212
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,083
Do I understand correctly?

213
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,208
No. That's not what I'm saying.

214
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,791
I certainly hope you
won't disappoint us.

215
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:53,458
You wouldn't wanna
let my bosses down.

You're wasting your time.

217

you should just take it.

Ever since your airport stunt.

00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,625

than good terms

00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,166
with the Japanese government.

221

We can't afford to interv--

222
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,333
[FIVE] What about an attack
from an armed group

223
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,458
of unknown affiliation?

224
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,666
That wouldn't have anything
whatsoever to do with us.

conference tonight.

228
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,375
So, what do you think's
gonna happen to him?

229
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,208
Will we ever see him again?

230
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,458

right to face Nine.

When you came for me.

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,875
I was so relieved, and so happy!

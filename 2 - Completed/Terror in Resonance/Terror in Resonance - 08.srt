We have some new information

13
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,708
regarding the bombing
incident at Haneda Airport.

14
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,875
The explosion occured
on an unoccupied runway,

fortunately resulting
in no injuries.

16
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,375
Based on suspicious
text messages,

17
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,416
the attack is suspected
to be connected

18
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,125
to the terrorist cell, Sphinx.

It's called direct

In spite of that,
you lot somehow got into

00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,166
a fight at the airport,
and even managed

23
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,083
to significantly interfere
with the investigation.

24
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,291
Was it worth it?

25
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,791
Because you're all now

174
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,625
anywhere on the public record.

175
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,541
But I do know members of
the Rising Peace Academy

176
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,458
spearheaded the project.

177
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,416
And since you were
one of those members.

178
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,041
I'm assuming you must have
known about this plan?

179
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,333
I'm very sorry,
but I don't know

180
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,708
what you're talking about.

181
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,875
Although, even if I did,
I certainly wouldn't be able

182
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,041
to divulge classified
information regarding it.

183
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,291
I'm assuming a detective
must have known that, though.

184
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,208
[SHIBAZAKI]
How's that son o' yours?

185
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,958
Behaving any better?

186
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,750
Now, why would
you bring that up?

187
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,458
It has already been resolved.

188
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,416
[SHIBAZAKI] Yes, and I'm
sure you're relieved.

189
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,250
But it seems he didn't
quite learn his lesson.

190
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,375
[FUJIKAWA] You bastard.
A detective using extortion?

191
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,666
How dare you? You should
know your place.

192
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,708
Funny how one can change when
they're about to be fired.

193
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,208
[SHIBAZAKI] Turns out I don't
give a damn about "my place."

194
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,875
[NINE]
How can you quit?

195
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,375
[TWELVE]
Because if we keep this up,

196
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,500
there's every chance we'll...

197
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,791
Are you scared?

198
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,041

199
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,208

Is it Lisa?

Remember where we came from.

203

We're only doing what
we have to, here.

00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,208
Or have... have you
changed your mind?

205

[NINE] I get it, I do.
That bomb almost killed her.

206
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,375
Okay. We'll stop
involving Lisa, then.

207
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,500
Yeah, that's a good idea.

208
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:39,041
[TWELVE] But I'm afraid it
still won't keep her safe.

209
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,833
[LISA whimpering]

210
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,833
Thought I'd help you
investigate today.

211
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,416
How'd you find me?

212
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,666
It wasn't very hard.

213
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,166
Just had to bribe someone
with some ramen.

214
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,500
You'll be fired if you
disobey orders again,

215
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,458
or did you forget? Got a job
lined up if you lose this one?

216
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:03,041
Folks own a grocery store.
Always got that to fall back on.

217
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,750
[HAMURA]
Orphanages?

218
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,166
[SHIBAZAKI]
Yeah.

219
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,416
According to that politician,
they tested the children

220
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,125
at all the orphanages in
the country, then gathered up

221
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,541
the ones they considered
the most "gifted".

222
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,041
[HAMURA] So what, you're
gonna check 'em all out?

223
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,041
One by one?

224
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,500
[SHIBAZAKI]
Yeah.

225
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,250
Probably ought to act like
a detective at some point.

226
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,000
[PRINCIPAL 8A] Yes, I believe
there was a test like that.

227
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,083
Far as I recall,
though, no children

228
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,625
from our institution passed it.

229
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,958
[YOUNG MAN 8A]
Well, I was only five.

230
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,875
So I don't remember
what was on the test.

231
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,250
But I do remember
being interviewed.

232
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,125
What's that?

233
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,250
[YOUNG MAN 8A]
Oh. I love those Sphinx guys.

234
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,791
They're legit.

235
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,625
[SHIBAZAKI] Okay, so
afterwards, the boy was taken

236
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,416
by a government official?

237
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,916
[NUN 8A] That's right, and we
never heard from him again.

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,625
[SHIBAZAKI] By chance,
do you happen to remember

239
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,000
anything about that official?

240
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,458
Sorry, but I think he
gave me a business card.

241
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,541
This is definitely weird.

242
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,291
All of these places and not
one person we talked to

243
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,791
has a clue where
those kids ended up.

244
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,958
[SHIBAZAKI]
Yeah.

245
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,083
Almost like they're
ghosts or something.

246
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,500
They just disappeared.

247
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:29,750
But at least we've got this guy,
and we know he's no ghost.

248
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,916
[KINOSHITA]
The Athena Plan?

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,666

Right. Get me whatever you can

Check the Ministry of Health,

Look into their past
employees, too.

You should be able to find this
Aoki guy's address there.

If I'm caught, I won't get
off with just being fired.

00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,000
Isn't hacking the cybercrime

No you ass,

343
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,625
This is a trap.

344
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,875
[TWELVE]
I know it is.

345
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,041
Then why go? We can't
afford to take chances.

346
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,166
We're running out of time!

347
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,250
[TWELVE]
I know that, too! Don't you see?

348
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,166
I'm going because
I'm out of time.

349
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,791
[NINE]
Twelve...

350
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,333
Don't do this.

351
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,125
I'm sorry, Nine.

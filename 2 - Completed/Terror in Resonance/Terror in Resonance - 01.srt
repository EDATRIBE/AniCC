Huh?

174
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,833
[FEMALE EMPLOYEE 1A]
Your attention, please.

175
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,958
You'll need to use the stairs
to exit the building.

176
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,916
[CHILD 1A sobbing]
I'm scared, mommy. I'm scared.

177
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,291
Mommy! Mom!

178
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,500
[NINE panting]

179
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,208
[LISA gasps]

180
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,583
It's you. Hey.

181
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,583
You really shouldn't
be in here, you know.

182
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,583
Eh?

183
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,750
So what -- are you
playing hide and seek?

184
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,125
[LISA gasps]

185
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,458
[TWELVE]
You can borrow that.

186
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,916
It sucks hiding all by yourself.
Now you won't get lonely.

187
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,083
Oh, I, uh!

188
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,833
[TWELVE]
Promise me something.

189
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:12,708
Don't let go of him.
Not until I say it's okay.

190
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:17,333
[LISA] Hold up. What is this?
Where are you going?

191
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,208
[NINE] After three PM, Tokyo
will be enveloped by darkness.

192
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,708
[TWELVE]
Ooh!

193
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,916
Large sparks will fly, scattered
around the Shinjuku area!

194
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,041
[MUKASA] Nah. This has
to be a coincidence.

195
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,500
[NINE]
Wouldn't want anyone to die.

196
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,166
[TWELVE]
Well then, folks--

197
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:58,708
[phones ringing]

198
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,458
Did all go according to plan?

199
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,916
Mostly. There's just
one little hitch.

200
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's Lisa. She saw me inside.

201
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,041
[phone rings]

202
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,125
[phone rings]

203
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,291
[phone rings]

204
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,708
[LISA panting]

205
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:34,791
[fire alarm ringing]

206
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:40,416
[fire alarm ringing]

207
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,666
[LISA grunts]

208
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,125
[TWELVE]
I left her in there.

209
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,291
If we don't do anything,
she'll most likely get killed,

210
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,625
but I did give her a Kururin.

211
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,625
[TWELVE]
This way,

212
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,666
we can either put her
out of her misery,

213
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,666
or we can go in and save her.

214
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,250
I figured you'd like to have
a choice in how we proceed.

215
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,666
What is this?

216
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,166
Are you trying to make me
relive that moment?

217
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,958
[NINE]
You know she's not one of us.

218
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,916
[TWELVE]
I'm aware. It's just...

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,458
I dunno.

220
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,458
I thought maybe this could help
you stop having that dream.

221
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,458
[NINE grunts]

222
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,666

223
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,750
[LISA gasps]

224
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,375
[TWELVE] Hello.
[LISA] Huh?

225
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,458
[TWELVE] Did you keep your
promise and hang onto him?

226
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,125
Give it. Listen up,
you have two options here.

227
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,500
[LISA gasps]

228
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,583
Choice one, you can
die where you stand.

229
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,541
Or choice two: you can
become an accomplice.

230
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,375
[LISA gasps]
Accomplice?

231
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,958
[NINE]
It's up to you. What'll it be?

232
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,541
I, uh, I don't know.

233
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:52,125
[banging]

234
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,791
I don't...

235
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,208
...wanna die.

236
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,750
[TWELVE]
Alright!

237
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,625
[NINE] From the resonance
I'm getting on my end,

238
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:05,083
you must be in the
stairwell. What floor?

239
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,875
Uh, the sixteenth?

240
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,333
[NINE]
Got it.

241
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:13,166
Take the stairs all the way
down to the fourth floor.

242
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,500
[LISA whimpers]

243
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,500

[LISA panting]

245
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,375
[NINE] When you get to Four,
take 15 steps forward.

246
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,000
Then move 23
steps to the right.

247
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,500
Take 12 steps forward.
When you're there...

248
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,791
[LISA sighs]

249
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,833
[NINE] ...leave the
plushie at your feet.

251
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,125

00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:01,208
[phone ringing]
[alarms blaring]

253
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,208
[NINE] Go back the way you came
and hide in the hallway.

254
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,583
Keep to the shadows.

255
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,875
Do it now!

00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,000

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,416
[BULLY GIRL 1A]
Do it already.

260
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,291
[WAKAMOTO]
Fly away, Lisa! Forever!

261
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,500
[NINE]
It's up to you. What'll it be?

262
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,125
[TWELVE]
So, what? Playing hide and seek?

263
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:17,291

00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:22,541

265
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:53,166
[NINE] Remember, you chose
this path. Not us.

266
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,083
Do you understand what
you've agreed to?

267
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,208
I--

268
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,583
Lisa, there's no going back.

00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,416
[LISA gasps]

270
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:14,541
[LISA] That smile...
It reminds me of something.

271
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:22,583
The sun on a hot summer day.
But those eyes are like ice.

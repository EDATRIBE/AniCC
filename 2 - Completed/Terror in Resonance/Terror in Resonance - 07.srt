00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,500
[TWELVE] Nice! Looks like
we've got an impostor.

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,458
Guess that's one way to know
we've hit the big time.

You think she wants to continue
the game from before?

Uh-huh. She's planning to
use airport as the board,

If we win, the position

25

match the bomb's location.

Hang on, so,

Yep. They didn't tell me why.

these images got on the screens.

it was the police?

order him to put up that image?

It's some kinda message.

00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,541
I'd guess the sender is
whoever set the bomb.

69
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,375
They're communicating with
someone trying to disarm it.

authority pull this off?

must be here too.

And the bomb? Gate 1O6.

No, you're right.

directly for the bomb.

But what about that
plus one of yours?

160
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,208
They helped camouflage
you both by causing

[FIVE] No, you do what I say!

174
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,291
But--

175
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,666
I don't remember
asking your opinion

176
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,875
or giving you
permission to shoot.

177
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,750
Can somebody get me
the control room?

178
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,750
[HAMURA]
Those were gunshots. Now what?

179
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,083
[SHIBAZAKI]
What the hell.

180
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,791
Like we don't already
have enough on our plate.

181
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:53,541
[HAMURA, SHIBAZAKI panting]

182
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,083
[HAMURA]
Shibazaki! What's the hold up?

183
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,708
Nine! I don't think
the bomb is here!

184
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,333
What?

185
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,541
I don't get it.

186
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,458
This was supposed to be
the checkmate spot!

187
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,541
[phone ringing]

188
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,416
I can't get out!
Please, you have to help me!

189
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,708
[LISA] I'm on a plane
and it's moving.

190
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,250
[TWELVE]
What? Why are you on a plane?

191
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,291
[LISA] This guy just
showed up and grabbed me,

192
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:32,750
and then forced me to get on.
The bomb is in here, too.

193
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,916
Tell me what to do!

194
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,416
[AIRPORT WORKER 7A]
Hey. Wasn't that plane

195
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,250
headed for the hangar?

196
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,208
Jus' stay calm, 'kay?

197
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,833
First of all,
who's piloting that thing?

198
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,416
[LISA]
Um. There's no one in there.

199
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,541
It's moving by itself!

200
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,041
Of course.

201
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,875
[NINE] That's why you
couldn't find the bomb

202
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,625
at the gate we thought.

203
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,000
[TWELVE] Because they
put it on a plane instead.

204
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,750
[NINE] Yeah. Now, that bomb
is on the move,

205
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,083
and I bet it's headed
right this way.

206
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,125
[NINE]
Gate 1O6, where we're standing.

207
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,458
[TWELVE gasps]

208
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,750
Damn it. What is her problem?

209
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,750
She's settling old scores.

210
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,208
[NINE] Okay, it's clearly
being driven remotely.

211
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,625
Which means we should have a
pretty good idea where she is.

212
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,416
[TWELVE]
In the control tower!

213
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,958
Here we are, Nine:
the final stage.

214
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,000
[FIVE]
Can you clear it, though?

215
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,500
What do we do?

216
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,958
The tower is crawling with
armed special assault forces.

217
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,666
We can't get anywhere near it.

218
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,875
We have to create
some kind of commotion.

219
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,208
The general public
needs to be evacuated.

220
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,708
Wait, what're you saying?

221
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,250
You know what'll happen to Lisa.

222
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,458
She's trapped in there
with the bomb!

223
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,916
I know.

224
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,833
[NINE] There is one way,
but it's risky.

225
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:21,666
[phone ringing]

226
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,041
[NINE]
Detective Shibazaki?

227
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,041
Who's this?

228
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,458
[NINE]
Sphinx Number One.

229
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,875
[SHIBAZAKI gasps]

230
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,375
What the hell? How do
you have this number?

231
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,916
[NINE]
No time to explain.

232
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,333
The bomb you're looking
for's not one of ours.

233
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,916
I'm sure you already
have an idea

234
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,875
of who'd wanna frame us.
But right now I need your help.

235
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,500
You do?

236
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,000
[NINE] At the moment,
there's a passenger jet

237
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,875
with a bomb on it heading
toward Gate 1O6.

238
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,875
[NINE] I have every reason
to believe it's real.

239
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,000
There's only one way to stop it.

240
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,750
You have to get into
the control room

241
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,125
and take over the
autopilot system.

242
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,583
It has to be you because

243
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,708
the special assault team
is swarming that area.

244
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,916
No way we can get near it.

245
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,791
Seriously. You're asking
for help from the police?

246
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,166
[NINE] The way I see it,
if that bomb goes off,

247
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,125
it becomes a problem
for both of us.

248
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,750
[SHIBAZAKI] So you're saying
we have mutual interests.

249
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,708
Well yeah. Isn't that
kinda your job?

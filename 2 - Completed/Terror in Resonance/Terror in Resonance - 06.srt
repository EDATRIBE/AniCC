Go ahead, Chief.

35
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,250
[KURAHASHI] The United States

We'll work with them,
and put their experience

Why don't you get some rest?

If she had wanted to escape

One thing. This is

Why bring in the FBI?

00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,708
Surely their capable personnel

101
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,291
There's a bit more to it.

102
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,958
[CLARENCE] Six months ago, a

00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,375

The United States Government is

117
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,541

00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,666
That's the funniest joke
I've heard all year.

00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,125

From what I gathered,

00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,583
the woman is a researcher with

00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,166

Okay, "Gaius Julius

"Gone to Arab?"

167
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:08,166
But he went to Egypt. I think
I know what this means, though.

168
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,125
It's a simple Caesar cipher.

169
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,000
So does that mean it
needs to be changed

00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,916

a fixed number of places
down the alphabet.

174
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,375
If there isn't an assigned
shift, the default

175
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,833
is three letters to the left.

176
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,708
Since there was
no assigned shift

177
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,541
sent with the message,
we'll have to hope

178
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,458
the default does the job.

179
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,500
[NINE grumbles]

180
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,250
No dice. Maybe, coordinates?

181
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,625
Could be.

182
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,625
[TWELVE] Haneda Airport,
International Terminal.

183
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,833
Yeah. It's one of our targets.

184
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,625
[OKANO] All right! Get a hold
of the airport right away!

185
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,083
Yessir!

186
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,416
So what's with the
twenty at the end?

187
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,625
[SHIBAZAKI] The time the bomb's
set to go off, most likely.

188
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,041
[phone chimes]

189
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,958
[HAMURA]
"VON voyage"?

190
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,208
As in "Have a nice trip"?
They're just messin' with us!

191
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,666
Also, they've misspelled it.

192
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,666
No. It's intentional.

193
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,041
"VON voyage?"
They're really trying

194
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,875
to make this look like us.

195
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,500
This is it. Her message to us.

196
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,125
[NINE] Her way of saying that
she's seen through everything.

197
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,666
[MANAGER 6A]
Yes.

198
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,458
I have already been briefed
on the situation by the MLIT.

199
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,541
[CLARENCE] Thing is,
this is very hush-hush.

200
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:06,083
Every single operative involved
has top-tier security clearance.

201
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,625
What we need from
you is discretion.

202
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,000
Therefore, any communication

203
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,875
with the terrorists
should be through us.

204
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,250
An' we'll pass the
info onto the police.

205
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,750
I understand. I'll make
the necessary arrangements.

206
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,458
Do you really think
those two are gonna bite?

207
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,125
They gotta be smart enough
to realize this is a trap.

208
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,125
They will come.

209
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,375
[CLARENCE gasps]

210
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,583
They will come to see me.

211
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,083
[TWELVE] Isn't it possible
the bomb's a fake?

212
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,291
[NINE] If it's Five, and she
never does anything half-assed,

213
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,750
she'll blow it up for real.
Because she has nothing to lose.

214
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,416
She knows the cops
will blame it on us.

215
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,375
Let's put out a video
saying it wasn't us!

216
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,625
The word of a mysterious
fringe group, or Metro PD.

217
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,833
Which one would you buy into?

218
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,166
[TWELVE]
So messed up.

219
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,500
Try to stop the bomb and
get caught. Or option two:

220
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:05,458
we ignore it, and are implicated
as murderous psychopaths.

221
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,750
'At's one hell of a trap!

222
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,083
[NINE]
It's summer vacation,

223
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,125
so the airport's
gonna be packed.

224
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,791
Depending on how strong the
bomb is and where it's placed.

225
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,666
Hundreds of those
people could die!

226
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,416
[TWELVE]
She's gone insane.

227
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,083
[NINE] You know there was never
any sanity to begin with.

228
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:27,250
Not for her, and not for us.

229
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,083
[INVESTIGATOR A]
Detective! Over here!

230
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,416
[INVESTIGATOR B]
Sir! On my way!

231
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,208
What's buggin' you?

232
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,416
I don't think this is
really from Sphinx.

233
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,583
Yeah? Why do ya say that?

234
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,041
The clue's too cut and dry.
Doesn't feel like

235
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,166
there's a message hiding
below the surface.

236
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,666
Look, we don't
have time to think

237
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,041
about that stuff right now.

238
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,833
We only have four hours
to find and disarm the bomb.

239
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,041
Let's go earn our
salaries, old man!

240
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,208
[SHIMADA]
Attention! Everybody listen up.

241
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,583
We have orders
straight from the top.

242
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,375
The Explosives Ordinance
Disposal team is en route

243
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,916
to remove the bomb.

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,500
We're supposed to stay here
and await further instructions.

245
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,333
But, wait a sec! Director!

246
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,541
This was a challenge
issued to Metro PD!

247
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,541
Please let us go!

248
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,583
[KATO]
C'mon, sir!

249
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,916
[KINOSHITA]
We want some payback!

250
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,666
[DETECTIVE 6A] Yeah!
Why do we have to stay put?

251
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,916
[DETECTIVE 6B]
What the hell is this?

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,458
[OKANO]
Everyone, calm down!

253
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,541
Director. You said these
orders came from the top?

254
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,875
From the Superintendent
General's mouth.

255
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,375
[SHIMADA]
I shouldn't have to say this,

256
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,583
but renegade cops
will not be tolerated.

257
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,458
No one get cute.

258
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,875
Uh, yo, Shibazaki.
Where're you going?

259
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,458
[SHIBAZAKI]
To grab some food.

260
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,500
I have a feeling we'll all be
stuck here for a while.

261
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,250
[TWELVE]
This is gonna suck.

262
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,833
The international terminal
is freakin' huge!

263
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,166
[NINE]
Yeah.

264
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,958
[TWELVE] So, how are we
supposed to find the bomb?

265
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,291
Well most likely,

266
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,541
we'll receive the next riddle
once we get there.

267
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,416
I counted about 1500
surveillance cameras

268
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,833
spread throughout the terminal.

269
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,458
[TWELVE] And naturally,
Five'll be monitoring

270
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,333
every single one of 'em.

271
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,875
[NINE] Which means we need
to act under the assumption

272
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,458
we'll be apprehended.

273
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,125
No way. We just
need someone new.

274
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,583
Someone whose face
hasn't been tied to us yet.

275
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,083
[LISA screams]

276
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:24,916
No! Sorry. I thought I'd
make noodles. You hungry?

277
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,000
No way in hell.

278
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,083
To what? The noodles?

279
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,791
[car beeps]

280
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,166
[HAMURA] Where do you
think you're going?

281
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,041
It's against the rules
to use official vehicles

282
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,375
for personal food breaks.

283
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:47,375
Or were you planning to get
yourself into trouble again?

284
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,250
[HAMURA]
Times have changed, gramps.

285
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,250
The lone wolf
shtick's kinda done.

286
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,958
[car beeps]

287
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,833
[OKANO] That goes for
you too, Hamura.

288
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,750
Sorry, boys. 'Bout
those "dinner" plans?

289
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,416
We'll be joinin' ya.

290
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,625
[NINE]
Impossible.

291
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,458
[TWELVE] Think about it.
Wouldn't someone amateurish

292
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,291
be useful in a
situation like this one?

293
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,208
[LISA]
Amateurish?

294
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,166
[NINE]
Let's go.

295
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,625
Wait. Kokonoe. Uh. Nine!

296
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,500
It's just that.
I want to be one of you.

297
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,625
Let me help your cause!

298
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,583
And maybe I can't
handle the bombs.

299
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,500
Or any of this other
stuff yet, but please!

300
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,208
I'll study hard!

301
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,958
[LISA gasps]

302
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,250
[NINE sighs]
We'll move separately.

303
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,458
[LISA gasps]

304
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,625
To avoid the security cameras.

305
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,625
[NINE] Take the train
out to the airport.

306
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,625
[LISA gasps]

307
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,500
Ah, the irony.

308
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,916
Here we are, a couple
terrorists, heading out

309
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,291
to try and prevent a bombing.

310
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,125
[CLARENCE]
Everything's in place.

311
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,041
[FIVE] Pull up the
"Runpass" activity log.

312
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,583
[OPERATOR 6A]
Yes, ma'am.

313
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,708
[FIVE] Filter down to users
active in the last 15 minutes.

314
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,958
[OPERATOR 6B]
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,541
[FIVE] Check with all
airport personnel lists.

316
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,166
Sure, one moment.

317
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,583
[FIVE]
Move!

318
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,250
[OPERATOR 6B]
My apologies.

319
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:26,000
You're getting careless. Nine.

320
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,583
[FIVE] Show the camera C15
feed from ten minutes ago.

321
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,916
[MALE OPERATOR 6A]
It'll take about three minutes

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,250
to transfer the data.

323
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,500
You're kidding me.

324
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,541
Bring up F12 to G6
on the main monitors.

325
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,791
[OPERATOR 6A]
Done.

326
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,458
[TWELVE]
S'about time, isn't it?

327
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,083
Yeah, let's move out.

328
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,083
[OPERATOR 6A]
Target confirmed.

329
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,625
A chessboard?

330
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,041
That's crazy.

331
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,125
You think she wants to
continue the game from before?

332
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,041
Uh-huh. She's planning to
use the airport as the board

333
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,000
and us as the pieces.

334
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,333
[TWELVE]
And lemme guess.

335
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,333
If we win, the position
of the last piece

336
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,416
will match the bomb's location.

337
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,791
Yeah.

338
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,541
[NINE grunts]

339
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,250
King's Knight to F6!

340
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,333
Good luck!

341
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,708
[FIVE] It's been far too
long since we last played.

342
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,541
Run, Nine.

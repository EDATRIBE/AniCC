1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,375
[TWELVE] It's true you
may be an accomplice.

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,875
You're not one of us, though.

3
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,208
Nothing personal.
But one false move,

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,750
and I'll have to kill ya.

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,666
[LISA gasps]

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,166
[KURAHASHI] I think these
guys have every intention

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,416
of picking a fight with
this entire country.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,375
We need you back. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,958
Come on out.
I'm waiting for you.

10
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,333
[HAMURA]
I can't believe this!

11
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,791
No! Some random, crusty
old dude from Archives

12
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,750
comin' up to be my boss?
It's a joke.

13
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,041
What. You haven't
heard of him before?

14
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,250
He's not random.

15
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,125
Shibazaki used to be
one of our best guys.

16
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,416
Huh?

17
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,875
[KINOSHITA] It's the truth.
He was incredible.

18
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,916
Everyone called him
"Razor Shibazaki".

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,708
Wish I had a nickname like that.
Wish I had a nickname, period.

20
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,208
An' how long's it been
since he was a detective?

21
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,041
This guy was basically
sent down to Archives

22
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,041
to rot until retirement.
And now he--

23
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,833
Morning.

24
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,541
[OKANO]
Hey, welcome back.

25
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,083
[MUKASA]
Come on, Shibazaki.

26
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,000
You realize I'm not helping you
move all this crap for free.

27
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,666
[SHIBAZAKI]
Anyone know where my desk is?

28
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,916
[OKANO] Yeah, it's right
over here. Scram.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,833
Man, you should treat me to
lunch or something for this.

30
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,541
[SHIBAZAKI]
You like ramen, right?

31
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,083
Stop doing that!

32
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,583
[MUKASA] I mean, yeah, I do,
but quit assuming all fat people

33
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,166
worship at the carb altar!

34
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,083
[OKANO]
Hey, Hamura!

35
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,833
[TWELVE]
It's tough. I don't know, Nine.

36
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,916
What if the riddle
is too hard for them?

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,541
It's fine, Don't worry.

38
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,083
[TWELVE]
Yeah, so you say.

39
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,750
I'm just not sure
what we're gonna do

40
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,500
if no one can solve it again.

41
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,625
The other day, when they
were investigating

42
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,541
the Roppongi bomb.

43
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,750
[NINE] I saw vans from
the Nuclear, Biological,

44
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,083
and Chemical Terrorism
Special Forces.

45
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,833
Makes me think.

46
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,916
It's possible they've got
someone who's figured out

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,500
what we're up to.

48
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,375
[NINE] This ought to
help us know for sure.

49
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,125
[OKANO]
As you can see,

50
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,791
the culprit entered the
police station like this.

51
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,958
[OKANO]
Ignoring surveillance cameras,

52
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,125
he calmly planted a delivery box
containing the plastic bomb,

53
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,916
turned around, and
left. In my opinion,

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,583
we should consider this
act our confirmation.

55
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,541
They are directly challenging
the police force.

56
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,041
[SHIMADA]
Understanding this threat,

57
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,208
we have no choice but
to assume they're likely

58
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,750
working on their next
bomb as we speak.

59
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,500
[KURAHASHI] So, I've got more
on the stolen plutonium--

60
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,166
from the nuclear
facility in Aomori?

61
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,583
One of the fugitives
was an employee.

62
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,833
But he had only been working
there for a few months.

63
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,708
In the files he's
Yuzu Miyajima.

64
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,750
Apparently, though, that
person has never existed.

65
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,000
How's that happen?

66
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,333
Best guess?

67
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,541
He used the Basic Residents'
Registration Network

68
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,250
to get hired on. He infiltrated
the government office

69
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,875
and fabricated a new identity.

70
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,583
An identity with local ties,
since the facility

71
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,916
tends to hire from within their
community whenever possible.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,416
[SHIBAZAKI]
And?

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,125
Look at his face. There's a
sketch of him in that file.

74
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,375
They didn't bother
takin' a photo?

75
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,375
No, they did. but it was
mysteriously deleted somehow.

76
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,333
At the time, we sent out
an emergency deployment.

77
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,041
But Miyajima and his accomplice
have seemingly vanished.

78
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:18,500
No trail, no trace, no
evidence they even existed.

79
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,583
Looks like he's only a kid.

80
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,166
[KURAHASHI]
Yeah.

81
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,166
I've told you about
what it was like

82
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,000
where I grew up, haven't I?

83
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,708
About being surrounded
by old people.

84
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:35,166
Oh yeah. You're from Hiroshima.

85
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,000
[SHIBAZAKI]
I'll never forget those summers.

86
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,250
Man, I hated them.

87
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,625
[SHIBAZAKI]
Once it started to get warm,

88
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,000
the city became a ghost town.

89
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:58,208
The elderly stayed in, almost
never leaving their houses.

90
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,250
They'd say they didn't feel
well because of the heat.

91
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:06,916
I spent a lot of time
with my grandmother.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,916
I always felt
as though the summer

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,458
would steal her from me.
She'd turn into someone else.

94
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:16,541
Yeah. I hated summer.
I resented it.

95
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,250
That's why you took this case.

96
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,666
Second-generation
victim of The Bomb?

97
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,625
[KURAHASHI] Must be hard
to watch a couple of kids

98
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,708
playing around
with nuclear weapons.

99
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,500
Yeah. They bother me.

100
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:33,458
Somethin' about this, though.
I dunno. Just doesn't add up.

101
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,541
[HAMURA]
Mister Kawai.

102
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,375
You've been doing
this a while, right?

103
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,083
How could you make
such a simple mistake

104
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,666
while working the crane?

105
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,375
I told you. I was tired
from tons of overtime, okay?

106
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,500
I've said it for years, man.
That company's a sweatshop.

107
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,958
So uh, why don't you
investigate that?

108
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,166
You listen!

109
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,083
[door clicks]

110
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,541
[OKANO]
Shibazaki.

111
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:36,250
S'cuse me. Mind if I have
a chair? I have a bad back.

112
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,708
[OKANO]
Oh, sure.

113
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,291
So, Mister Kawai.
You're a big fan of gambling.

114
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,541
[KAWAI]
Yeah? What's your point?

115
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,916
[SHIBAZAKI] Horses or fights?
I'm guessing fights.

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,916
[KAWAI]
Huh?

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,833
What kinda bet did
you lose, guy?

118
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,041
I hear someone's hired gun's
been payin' you visits.

119
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,000
No, uh, not recently.

120
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,333
[SHIBAZAKI]
Why's that?

121
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,500
Why would a man whose job
is to get money from you

122
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,500
stop showing up?

123
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,000
Uh...

124
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,375
[banging]

125
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,083
What's this?

126
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,833
Maybe it's the debt collector in
question comin' to answer that.

127
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:09,833
[KAWAI gasps]

128
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,333
[door creaks]

129
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,708
[KINOSHITA]
I got something, Shibazaki.

130
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,916
[SHIBAZAKI] All the proof we
needed was just sittin' there

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,791
on your computer.

132
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:23,250
Surprising, since you handed
it over to us voluntarily.

133
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,708
[SHIBAZAKI]
Kawai confessed to everything.

134
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,041
He got an email saying
if he cut the power line

135
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,750
and made it look
like an accident,

136
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,083
he'd receive two million
yen for the effort.

137
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,416
And the money?

138
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Did they ever actually
deliver any of it to him?

139
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,833
Yes.

140
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,833
Apparently, Kawai replied
saying he could do it.

141
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,958
And even though he never told
anyone his account number,

142
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,916
he had one million
transferred to him.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,708
Have we looked into the sending
account and time of transfer?

144
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,000
Nothing there, either.

145
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,291
The transfer came from
a dummy account.

146
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,208
There's a bigger issue, though.

147
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,666
These guys knew
what would happen

148
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,458
if that power line was cut.

149
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,625
They planned this "accident" so
there'd be a citywide blackout,

150
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,708
cutting off power to the
government building.

151
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,666
[SHIBAZAKI]
But we're talking about

152
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,958
well-prepared criminals here.
Why would they choose

153
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,083
to leave behind an email
that could be traced?

154
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,791
Not to mention the footage
from Roppongi Station.

155
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,000
It's as if they're intentionally
leaving behind evidence

156
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,250
for us to find.

157
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,791
[KATO] Uh.
[OKANO] What's the problem?

158
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:23,541
[KATO]
We got another one! It's Sphinx!

159
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,625
[NINE]
Sorry to keep you waiting, fans!

160
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,041
It's time for "Can you
solve Sphinx's riddle?"

161
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,250
I'm Sphinx Number One.

162
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,250
[TWELVE]
And I'm Sphinx Two.

163
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,875
[NINE]
Now, for today's riddle.

164
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,375
What is the building next
to the house of the god

165
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,333
who solved the riddle?

166
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,416
[TWELVE] Remember,
there will be another "boom"

167
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,083
if you don't solve it in time!

168
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,583
[NINE]
You have until 10 AM tomorrow.

169
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,083
[TWELVE]
Good luck, everyone!

170
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,541
Keep walkin' until you have
to drag your foot behind you

171
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,750
like a good,

Sphinx Two is clapping his
hands like he's praying.

178
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,750
I'd say "house of the god" has
to refer to a shrine somewhere.

179
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,375
Okay, then what god
are they talking about?

180
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,875
Which one solved the
Sphinx's riddle correctly?

181
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,375
That was Oedipus!

182
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,750
Oedipus is from Greek myth.
You think maybe he's got

183
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,333
some kind of analog
in Japanese tradition?

184
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,083
[SHIBAZAKI] Yeah. I like
how you're thinkin'.

185
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,458
What do you think that
"drag your foot behind you"

186
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,916
comment was about?

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,833
Best guess, it has to do
with the name Oedipus.

188
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,708
It means "swollen foot".

189
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,583
[HAMURA]
Why name him that?

190
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,583
Because after abandoning
Oedipus in the forest,

191
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,833
Laius didn't want
him to run away,

192
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,458
so dear ol' dad put a nail
through his son's heel.

193
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,166
Well, that's brutal.

194
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,958
[SHIBAZAKI] He wound up
being saved by a shepherd

195
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,208
and then adopted by
the king of Corinth.

196
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,375
When the king saw
the child's injured leg,

197
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,833
he named him "swollen foot",
or Oedipus.

198
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,333
[HAMURA]
How literal.

199
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,041
According to one theory.

200
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,000
Oedipus remained disabled
to some extent his whole life.

201
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,541
"Crippled".

I usually assume kids these
days play this stuff to avoid

233
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,250
dealing with people, but it
looks like making connections

234
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,791
might still be a thing.

235
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,500
That's not good. You just made
a "kids these days" comment.

236

beat the green dragon!

on this jerk for days!

240
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:23,291
That's right. He was an
ancestor of Oedipus's mother.

But you have been abandoned.

supposed to lie, either.

[SHIBAZAKI] Hello. This is
for Sphinx One and Two.

277
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,958
I'm Detective Shibazaki.

278
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,541
[TWELVE gasps]
Nice!

279
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,500
You'll be happy to know I have
an answer for your riddle.

280
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,916
[SHIBAZAKI] You asked us
"What's the building

281
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,208
next to the house of the god
who solved the riddle?"

282
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,333
We know the one who solved the
Sphinx's riddle was Oedipus.

283
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,000
He wasn't the child of
a god, but the ancestor

284
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,875
of his mother and wife was
a dragon in human form.

285
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,333
One theory states that
Oedipus was crippled,

286
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:03,541
as you so eloquently put it,
for his entire life.

287
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,416
A dragon who drags
his feet? Arahabaki.

288
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,208
Oh, ho!

289
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,125
[SHIBAZAKI]
Arahabaki is a mysterious god

290
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,958
found in the Kanto
and Tohoku regions.

291
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,000
The god of fighting
and iron-making.

292
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,000
He's also known as
"god of feet".

293
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,416
At one point, he had to
wander different areas

294
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,125
after losing his home.

295
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:26,083
He became so exhausted
that he dragged his feet.

is using the internet to
answer the bombers' riddle.

299
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,458
[SHIBAZAKI] Also. The "habaki"
part of "Arahabaki?"

300
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,500
It's derived from "dragon tree".

301
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,958
Connecting it to
the dragon god.

302
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,041
The most famous Arahabaki
shrine is in Miyaki Prefecture.

303
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:54,166
However, he's still worshipped
within Tokyo proper, as well.

Department solved

341
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,250
the bombers' riddle from
a video streaming site,

342
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,666
and the bomb was
found succes--

343
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,666
[HAMURA] Um, excuse me,
Director Kurahashi?

344
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,166
Hm? What is it?

345
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,625
It's about Shibazaki.

346
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,500
What is his deal? I heard
he used to be an ace.

347
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,541
But then what? I'm just
curious what happened.

348
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:20,541
[KURAHASHI sighs] It goes back
15 years, when a Diet secretary

349
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,541
from the ruling party fell to
his death from a hotel room.

350
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,833
Okay?

351
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,875
[KURAHASHI] It was initially
ruled to be an accident

352
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,416
or a suicide, but Shibazaki
refused to accept that.

353
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,916
He insisted on the possibility

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,416
that the dead man
had been involved

355
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,750
in some kind of conspiracy,
and even went so far

356
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,291
as to investigate the leader of
the victim's political faction.

357
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,250
[KINOSHITA]
That couldn't have ended well.

358
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,583
The faction leader?

359
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,791
Originally from the
Police Department.

360
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,375
[HAMURA, KINOSHITA gasp]

361
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,708
[HAMURA] Totally get why he
was demoted to archives, now.

362
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,375
[KURAHASHI]
Shibazaki had a family.

363
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,541
He had his life.
The only thing he could do

364
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,541
at that point was
accept the transfer.

365
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:09,875
However, he has never forgotten.

366
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:14,541
And he hasn't given up.
That was a long summer.

367
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,916
[SHIBAZAKI
'Nother hot one again today.

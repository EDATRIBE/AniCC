The cops almost caught her,

She's helpless, Nine.
We should keep an eye on her.

16
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,458
The girl is an outsider.

17

She stays, and
everything we've fought

[TWELVE] The thing is. She
hasn't got anywhere else to go.

20

her escape, it really hit home.

[TWELVE] Lisa isn't that
different from us.

00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,208

00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,000
Huh? Yes, well?

133
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,875
Come on. How many years
you worked archives?

134
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,583
[HAMURA] What're you
doing in the file room?

135
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,208

00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,750
[HAMURA] Document numbers.
An old case file?

137
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,583
[SHIBAZAKI] The bombers
must've seen our departmental

138
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,791
filing system after
they hacked us.

139
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,416
They only leaked files from
the current investigation

140
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,750
to the public. But it's
a reasonable assumption

141
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,916
they also got ahold of
some older documents.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,375
So long story short,
they intentionally made a riddle

143
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,875
only the police
would understand?

144
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,500
Guess these terrorists
have taken a shine to us.

145
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,916

146
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,166
[MUKASA] Let's see...
Corporal punishment case

147
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,416
from the public high
school in Tochigi?

148
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,125
[SHIBAZAKI] After showing
up late to their club's

149
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,166

students got heat stroke

150
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,333
after being forced to run
in over 100 degree weather.

151
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:32,250
All charges against the
offender were dropped. Odd.

152
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,166
So what's this got
to do with the bombings?

153
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,791
[SHIBAZAKI] There's a passage
in the Apocalypse of Baruch.

154
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,250
The story of an angel
who angered God.

155
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,833
His offense was planting a
grapevine in the Garden of Eden.

156
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,208
The Kabbalah identifies
him as Samael,

157
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,875
but he's also known
as the Red Serpent.

158
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,625
Hell of a nickname.

159
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,958
So, tie it with the
information from the file.

160
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,541
High school kids punished
by being forced to run.

161
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,583
A red serpent forced to run.

162
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,291
What does that sound
like to you, Mukasa?

163
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,416
Running red serpent? No clue.

164
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,250
What could be stretched out like
a snake that runs? In a city?

165
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,416
[HAMURA gasps]
A train.

166
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,833
Right.

167
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,791
And a red train in the middle
of the city would be?

168
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,208
The Shuto Shinjuku!
Time to move!

169
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,916
We gotta tell somebody!

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,250
[SHIBAZAKI] The bomb's probably
in one of the train cars.

171
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,166
[HAMURA] Then we'll have
to check them all!

172
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,166
Subway, huh?

173
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,416
These targets are all
inter-connected somehow.

174
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,958
[MUKASA gasps]

175
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:39,541
[SHIBAZAKI] I'm saying these
aren't random acts of terrorism.

176
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,583
[TWELVE] Hey so, Nine.
That last riddle we gave.

177
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,500
Do you think it was
a bit too simple?

178
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,958
[NINE] It would be problematic
if it was too hard

179
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,166
for them to solve.

180
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,666
[TWELVE] I knew you
made it easy on purpose!

181
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,041
[NINE] Yes. This Detective
Shibazaki should have

182
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,458
figured out the
connection between

183
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,708
all of the bombing
locations by now.

184
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,583
Since we never
make any demands,

185
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,500
he's the kind who would
look for a connection

186
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,458
to figure out what we're after.

187
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,750
You sure have put a lot of trust
into a government official.

188
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,708
What?

189
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,875
Heh! Nothin'. It was a joke.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,208
[SHIBAZAKI] Governor Aohara,
office in the Tokyo Metro

191
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,916
Government Building,
site of the first bombing.

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,708
Chief of Police
at Roppongi Station,

193
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,916
location of the second bombing.

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,875
A former Chief Cabinet
Secretary and owner

195
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,041
of the building next
to Shirahige Shrine,

196
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,750
the failed third bombing.

197
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,375
And last, head of the
municipal organization

198
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,291
that manages the
Shuto Shinjuku Line.

199
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,958
There's a connection
between 'em.

200
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,875
They all took part
in a seminar run by

201
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,458
the Rising Peace Academy.

202
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,458
The Rising Peace Academy?

203
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,041
[SHIBAZAKI]
Yeah.

204
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,541
'Promoting interaction between
the government and its people'.

205
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,041
Looks like a non-profit
on the surface.

206
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,250
But their seminars have
attracted a lot of big-wig types

207
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,708
over the last few years.

208
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,458
From politicians to
captains of industry.

209
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,708
Pretty weird.

210
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,000
No, not weird.

211
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,500
This connects the dots
between their targets.

212
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,666
[MUKASA]
You're probably overthinking it.

213
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,750
These kids just wanna
watch our reaction.

214
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,125
Not make a point.

215
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,458
[SHIBAZAKI]
Oh, you've got some insight

216
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,458
on terrorist psychology? Huh?

217
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,666
Uh... I wonder
if they're done.

218
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,583
Dealing with the bomb, that is.

219
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,791
[NINE]
Anything?

220
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,666
[TWELVE]
Whole lotta nada.

221
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,791
[NINE] That's strange.
There's been no report

222
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,041
about the bomb being removed.

223
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,083
[TWELVE] Maybe the riddle
was still too hard for them?

224
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,000
[NINE] I don't think so.
That detective's smart.

225
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,541
He should've figured it out.

226
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,125
[TWELVE]
So what do we do? At this rate,

227
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:41,083
in a little over an hour,
we'll be mass murderers.

228
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,458
Not to worry.
This will deactivate it.

229
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,666
[TWELVE]
Huh?

230
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,958
[NINE]
What's wrong?

231
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,750
That's crazy. No signal.

232
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,250
What the--? Oh, ya
gotta be kidding me!

233
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,125
[WOMAN 5A]
Wha--?

234
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,375
[WOMAN 5B]
No signal.

235
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,708
[MAN 5A]
Are you there?

236
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,750
Weird.

237
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,833
[NINE]
None on this one, either.

238
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,625
[TWELVE] Every carrier,
same issue, same time?

239
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,041
That's impossible!

240
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,500
[NINE]
No, it's possible.

241
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,625
Someone's creating this
interference on purpose.

242
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,208
Like who? Nine?

243
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,000
[SHIBAZAKI]
Have you lost your mind?

244
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,250
Why haven't your people
removed the bomb?

245
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,625
We were given orders.
Straight from the top.

246
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,666
[SHIBAZAKI]
What?

247
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,083
They said the
special assault team

248
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,958
would take care of it
and we should standby

249
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,083
for further instruction.

250
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,041
But sir!

251
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,333
So we just twiddle
our thumbs?

252
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,041
That's what you're saying?

253
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,666
I'm afraid so.

254
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,916
And this
electromagnetic jamming.

255
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,125
It's got something
to do with this?

256
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,833
Look. I am out of the loop.

257
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,041
Shibazaki! Don't do
anything stupid!

258
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,500
Has the past taught
you nothing at all?

259
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,500
[HAMURA]
Shibazaki!

260
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,166
Check in. Can you
hear me, Twelve?

261
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,625
[TWELVE]
Loud and clear.

262
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,083
Let's work fast.

263
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,875
I can calculate the general
location of the train car.

264
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,875
But I won't be able
to pinpoint it yet.

265
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,041
[NINE] For that, I'm gonna
need to access their system

266
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,250
via a backdoor.

267
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,583
I'll give you a more
precise location later.

268
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,125
The bomb is set to
blow at eight sharp.

269
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,833
We have to personally
retrieve it before then.

270
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,208
[TWELVE]
Remove and disarm the bomb

271
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,208
in 50 minutes, undetected?

272
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,541
[NINE]
Correct.

273
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,500
[TWELVE] What is this,
Mission: Impossible?

274
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,541
[NINE]
This is the only way.

275
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,541
We used five kilos of
gunpowder this time around.

276
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:49,750
That's more than enough to
destroy the entire train car.

277
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,916
[TWELVE]
Well, that's awesome.

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,750
They should've solved
the riddle by now.

279
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,875
So what are the police up to?

280
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,250
[NINE]
The electromagnetic interference

281
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,208
is blocking out cell service.

282
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,875
I don't think this
is a coincidence.

283
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,458
[TWELVE] Are you telling
me someone outside

284
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,583
the police department is
creating these problems

285
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,708
to try and screw things up?

286
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,000
And whoever that is,
doesn't want the bomb stopped.

287
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,583
They want the thing to go off?

288
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,208
[NINE]
It's the logical answer.

289
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,750
[TWELVE]
That person's nutso.

290
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:19,125
[NINE]
To say the least. Yes. I'm in.

291
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,250
[NINE gasps]

292
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,958
Wait. Whaddaya mean
by "multiple signals?"

293
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,208
[NINE] Damn it! There's
no way another train car

294
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,041
could have the same
signature. It's impossible.

295
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,541
[TWELVE]
Obviously not.

296
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,041
[NINE] We're being cornered
with fake operations data.

297
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,291
Someone's doing this.

298
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,833
[TWELVE gasps]

299
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,666
[NINE] There must have been
a trap in the backdoor I used

300
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,791
to infiltrate the train
company's security interface.

301
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,708
[TWELVE] So the person
behind all of this knew

302
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,166
we'd hack into the system.

303
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,333
They set up a fake
backdoor to trap us?

304
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,875
Looks that way. Wait, here.

305
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,375
I'll make another sweep
through the normal OS now.

306
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,625
Try to track the train down.

307
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,375
[NINE] In the meantime, hop onto
the train car closest to you.

308
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,458
But we only have 30 minutes.

309
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,708
[NINE]
We don't have a choice!

310
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,541
[TWELVE]
Gotcha! No rest for the wicked!

311
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,583

What?

312
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,500
They cracked their way in?

knows their stuff.

314
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,666

00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,125
[TWELVE]
What? It's close by?

345
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,041
[NINE] If I head there from
here, I might make it.

346
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,166
Sounds good. I can wipe
the camera feeds!

347
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,458
[NINE]
Thanks!

348
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,916
[NINE panting]

349
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,541
[NINE panting]

350
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:11,041
[NINE panting]

351
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,458
[CROWD screams]

352
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,958
[NINE]
It's a bomb! Run, hurry!

353
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,541
There's a bomb on the train!

354
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:38,833
[CROWD screaming]

355
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,291
[NINE grunting]

356
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,875
[NINE grunts]

357
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,458
[CROWD screaming]

358
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,083
You wanna explain
what the hell's goin' on?

359
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,291
[SHIMADA]
Shibazaki!

360
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,750
[SHIBAZAKI]
Where was Special Assault Team?

361
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,833
You pulled us off the bomb
so they could deal with it!

362
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,375
[KURAHASHI] I was given every
assurance they would.

363
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,416
Yeah, from who?
What bastard let this happen?

364
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,541
[MALE OFFICER 5A] Everyone
please, try to stay calm!

365
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,083
Exit the subway in
an orderly fashion.

366
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,125
[NINE grunts]

367
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,916
[NINE coughs]

368
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Nine! Can you hear me?

[NINE]
Yeah.

370
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,916
[TWELVE]
Are you okay? Are you alive?

371
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,500
Of course I am.

372
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,666
[MALE OFFICER 5A] Please
calm down, help is on the way!

373
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:58,291
[phones ringing]

374
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,458
Hey, Nine. Is this?

375
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,708
[NINE]
Yeah. There's no doubt.

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,833
Five is back.

377
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,458
[FIVE] Such a spectacular
fireworks display.

378
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,875
Perfect for celebrating
our reunion.

379
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,000
Don't you think? Nine?

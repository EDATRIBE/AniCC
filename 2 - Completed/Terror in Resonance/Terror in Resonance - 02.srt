placed the bombs

Please give us your professional
opinion about the bomb.

88
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,500
Yes, sir. But, before
that, I'd like to talk about

89
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,458
the structure of
the government office.

90
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,500
The pillars that support
the frame of the building are,

91
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,458
in fact, four times
thicker than usual,

92
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,083
and due to that
particular strength,

93
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,416
they are commonly
referred to as "super pillars."

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,125
They were created
with attacks in mind,

95
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,541
so they can't be destroyed
by standard bombs.

96
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,041
To be clear.

97
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,958
You're telling us these were
not run-of-the-mill devices?

98
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,125
Thermite reaction
tells you they weren't.

99
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,541
Um, an on-site
investigation detected

100
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,458
the chemical reaction
was present.

101
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,083
A thermite reaction?

102
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,166
Is that unusual in
your experience, Chief?

103
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,625
[HAMADA]
No, on the contrary,

104
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,416
this reaction's extremely
common. As a matter of fact,

105
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,083
it's an everyday practice
for welding metal.

106
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,666
To put it very simply,
if a mixture of iron oxide

107
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,416
and aluminum powder is ignited,

108
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,250
it produces a large
amount of heat.

109
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,791
[HAMADA]
Up to 3,000 degrees Celsius.

110
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,375
Such a high temperature
is greater than

111
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,708
the melting point of
both iron and concrete,

112
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,500
which means the reaction has
the ability to melt either one.

113
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,791
The ingredients required
to create such a reaction

114
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,041
are also quite a bit easier
to obtain than gunpowder.

115
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,750
Are you're saying
this is what was used

116
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,041
to melt the pillars?

117
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,916
[HAMADA]
It more than likely was, yes.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The purpose of the mixture
was to set off the fire alarms.

119
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,458
Then, once the water from the
sprinklers combined with it,

120
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,125
a phreatic explosion
was created.

121
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,375
At that point, the pillars,
unable to withstand

122
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,000
the weight of the
building, collapsed

123
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,833
along with the structure.

124
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,500
There have not been
many terrorist attacks

125
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,541
that have used this
method in the past.

126
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,083
However, these bombers
didn't just use the reaction,

127
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,541
they planned for the
phreatic explosion as well.

128
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,041
Whoever is behind this assault

129
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,916
is without a doubt
extremely intelligent.

130
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,916
[HAMADA]
That being said,

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,833
there's still one thing
I can't figure out.

132
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,208
[SHIMADA]
And that would be?

133
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,958
[HAMADA] Strangely enough,
there was a single

134
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,250
TNT bomb used in the attack.

135
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,208
In no way could that have
been necessary to cause

136
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,333
the collapse of the building,
so I decided to reconstruct

137
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,625
the TNT bomb myself
to see if I could find out

138
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,833
why it was there.

139
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,041
What?

140
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,708
I didn't know you could
reconstruct a bomb.

141
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,958
Oh, it's not all that difficult
when TNT is being used.

142
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,166
Anyway, on the TNT, I found
letters that looked like

143
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,083
they had been written
by the bombers.

144
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,333
And?

145
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,458
[HAMADA]
This is what I discovered.

146
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,583
[HAMADA]
You can see them very clearly.

147
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,458
Three letters. V-O-N.

148
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,375
[KURAHASHI] Can you believe
Public Safety is letting

149
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,666
First Division lead a
terrorist investigation?

150
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,916
[SHIMADA]
Of course.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,958
If this thing turns into
a worst-case scenario,

152
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,041
both the media and
the police department

153
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,750
want to be certain they
can still cover it up.

154
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,833
V-O-N.

155
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,208
[SHIMADA]
Yeah.

156
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,416
Guess we know it's connected
to that recent theft.

157
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,333
[SHIMADA] If the public
finds out, they'll panic.

158
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,750
[KURAHASHI]
Indeed, they will.

159
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,125
We need to consider the
likelihood that these attackers

160
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,208
are not with an
existing terrorist cell.

161
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,500
[SHIMADA]
I agree.

162
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,458
But the Public
Safety Bureau does not,

163
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,583
and we're supposed to be
cooperating with them--

164
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,958
indirectly, of course.

165
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,541
No surprise there.

166
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,083

want the freedom to blame us.

00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,541
[TWELVE]
Lisa Mishima?

175
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,666
[NINE]
Yeah.

176
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,000
[TWELVE]
You worried?

177
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,541
Nah. I can't imagine she
has the guts to report us.

178
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,916
[TWELVE] Let me ask you
something. Why "accomplice"?

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,416
Why use that word when you
were talking to her?

180
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,791
Just trying to scare her.

181
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,583
That's all, huh?

182
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,041
[NINE]
Whose turn?

183
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,625
[TWELVE]
Hmm. One, two,

184
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,708
[NINE, TWELVE]
Three!

185
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,958
[NINE] Hello. Delivery
from Choujyuan Noodles.

186
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,083
Oh. Yeah, just bring it on in.

187
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,625
[NINE]
Cool. Thank you.

188
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,958
Yeah, tried that new
ramen place last night.

189
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,375
You gotta go.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,625
[MUKASA]
I don't get you, man.

191
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,750
How can you work
on a crossword puzzle?

192
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,875
First Division looks like

193
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,833
they're in serious
trouble, you know.

194
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,041
But I guess that doesn't affect
us down here in archives.

195
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,291
[SHIBAZAKI] Which is why you're
just screwing around online.

196
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,708
Hey, help me out.

197
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,125
Do you know what the
"instant pork ramen from 1987

198
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,750
that was recently reissued" is?

199
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,041
Oh, come on!

200
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,833
Maybe you could help
me out and not assume

201
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,541
all fat people are
experts on carbs, yeah?

202
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,875
Oh. Try Toppa Chikara
Kusa Yantsuki.

203
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,291
Ah. T.O.P.

204
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,583
[MUKASA] And I'm not screwing
around, by the way.

205
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,875
I'm secretly and covertly
trying to figure out

206
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,875
what Sphinx's next
move could be.

207
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,541
[MUKASA gasps] Too late!
They released a new video!

208
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,958
[NINE]
I'm Sphinx Number One.

209
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,083
[TWELVE] I'm Sphinx Two,
and I heart explosions!

210
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,125
Did you enjoy the fireworks at
the Tokyo Government Office?

211
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:17,166
All that excitement came from
our very own handmade bombs.

212
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,916
He worked pretty
hard on it, too!

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,375
[NINE] This is only the
beginning of the party, though!

214
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:25,583
In the very near future, we'll
be setting off a second bomb!

215
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,333
[NINE]
We have a riddle for everyone.

216
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,083
Specifically those of you
from law enforcement.

217
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,125
What?

218
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,583
[TWELVE hums]

219
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:35,333
[NINE] What first walks on
two legs, then on four legs,

220
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,500
and finally on three legs?

221
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,791
[TWELVE]
If you solve the riddle,

222
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,875
then the next bomb
can be yours!

223
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:42,958
[NINE, TWELVE]
Good luck!

224
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,208
Aw, poor First Division.

225
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,958
Those guys sure as hell won't
be goin' home for a while.

226
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,416
[HAMURA] The hell's
the point of a riddle?

227
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,000
Damn snots need
to learn some respect!

228
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,333
How dare they?

229
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,250
They could just be mouthpieces
for the real guys.

230
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,375
In the long run though,
I guess it doesn't matter.

231
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,916
[door opens]

232
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,333
The last thing
we need right now

233
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,375
is children using bombs as toys.

234
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,583
[HAMURA]
Director Kurahashi.

235
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,166
[KURAHASHI]
The suspects refer to themselves

236
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,791
as "Sphinx," pronouncing it with
a "P" instead of the usual "F".

237
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,375
This isn't from the Egyptian.

238
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,750
It's actually a
Greek pronunciation.

239
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,125
[KURAHASHI]
Sphinx.

240
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,083
Commonly known as one
of the many creatures

241
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:59,458
from Greek mythology.
It appears in Oedipus Rex.

242
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,500
Laius, Oedipus's father,

243
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,000
after being told by an Oracle

244
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,750
that his son would kill him,
abandoned Oedipus

245
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,375
in the forest when he
was still just a child.

246
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,833
However, Oedipus survived
and grew into an adult.

247
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,666
The Oracle was right,
and one day,

248
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,625
Oedipus did end up
killing Laius.

249
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:21,333
Of course, at the time, he did
not know Laius was his father.

250
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,250
[LISA] Afterwards, Oedipus
married the king's wife.

251
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,166
But Queen Jocasta
was his mother.

252
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,875
[LISA] When Oedipus
discovered the truth,

253
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,916
that he had murdered
his own father,

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,625
that he had married
his own mother.

255
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:41,458
He could not bear the guilt,
and in order to punish himself,

256
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:45,875
he gouged out his eyes,
making himself blind.

257
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,458
[TWELVE]
Whatcha readin'?

258
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,416
[LISA gasps]
Oh, I-- n-nothing.

259
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,916
Hm.

260
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:04,291
[LISA] Um, if you don't mind
me asking, why are you here?

261
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,333
I understand if
you're keeping tabs.

262
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,333
It makes perfect sense.

263
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,583
--You wanna learn a fun trick?
--[LISA] Huh?

264
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,583
I'll just take that as a yes.

265
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,208
[TWELVE] First, make a blend of
half cola and half green tea.

266
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,875
Here you go. Then,
put this in and laugh.

267
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,000
[LISA yelping]
[TWELVE laughing]

268
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,666
[TWELVE]
It's the fresh maker cola!

269
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,750
[LISA]
Hey! Hold on a sec!

270
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:40,166
[LISA panting]

271
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,416
[KURAHASHI] Oedipus went to
visit the country of his father,

272
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,000
whom he had killed.
He was confronted there.

273
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,333
A monster appeared
and blocked his way.

274
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,416
[KURAHASHI]
The Sphinx asked riddles

275
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,041
of the people it encountered.

276
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,500
If they didn't give the correct
answer, they would be devoured.

277
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:59,250
Sounds fun. What kind of
riddles are we talkin'?

278
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,375
"What walks on four
legs in the morning,

279
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,291
on two legs in the afternoon,

280
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,791
and on three legs
in the evening?"

281
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,166
[OKANO, KINOSHITA gasp]
[KURAHASHI] That's right.

282
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,291
[KURAHASHI] It's very similar
to the riddle in the video.

283
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,500
We need to take
these guys seriously.

284
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,750
Okay, if that's the question,
what's the answer?

285
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,250
[KURAHASHI]
The answer is "man."

286
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,250
How come?

287
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,625
I get it.

288
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,375
As an infant, man is forced
to crawl on four legs.

289
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,833
Then as adults, we walk on two.

290
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,166
Elderly people use canes,
which makes three.

291
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,000
Correct. And the times of day?

292
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,708
[KURAHASHI] They represent
the different stages

293
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,875
in a man's life.

294
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,125
[HAMURA]
So how does that relate

295
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,750
to the next bomb
they've set "Man?"

296
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,791
Yeah, or people?

297
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,041
[OKANO] So, a busy shopping area
with a lot of foot traffic?

298
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,250
What if those numbers
match up to an address?

299
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,125
Like Fourth Street, Building
Two-Three or something?

300
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:52,083
Checking on corresponding
addresses, now.

301
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,791
[KINOSHITA gasps] There's a DNA
research facility in Minato!

302
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,791
[HAMURA] DNA, riddle of man.
That has to be it!

303
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,833
Good enough for me,
let's get a search warrant.

304
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,416
I'm coming, too.

00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:09,333

[OFFICERS] Yes, sir!

308
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,708
[NEWS ANCHOR 2B]
As of right now.

309
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,083
Police on the scene,

00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,625

311
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,875
So, we're left to wonder
if the next bomb

00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,041
is at this DNA
research facility.

313

It doesn't seem they're any
closer in finding out who--

Oh good.

You haven't changed
your number on me, yet.

[KURAHASHI]
Not yet.

319
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,791
I've been thinkin'
about that riddle

00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,083
those self-proclaimed
bombers left you.

00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,583

Care to hear my thoughts?

00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:49,250
Of course I do. N'you haven't
changed a bit, my friend.

323
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:53,791
Nope. They're referring to
the mythology of Oedipus.

324
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,083
[KURAHASHI]
Yeah. The answer is "man".

325
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,333
Wrong.

326
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,166
Although "Man" was the
answer to other riddle

327
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,833
the Sphinx was known to ask.

328
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,083
You mean it asked
more than one?

329
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,875
[SHIBAZAKI] Yeah, there's
another lesser-known version

330
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,666
of the story. Two legs in the
morning, four in the afternoon,

331
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,166
and three legs in the evening.

332
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,708
In other words, a
two-four-three progression.

333
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,875
Two-four...?

334
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,833
Meaning the answer
can't be "man" anymore.

335
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,708
[KURAHASHI] So do you
know what the answer is?

336
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,958
[SHIBAZAKI]
Yes, it's Oedipus himself.

337
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,375
Gonna have to
explain that one.

338
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,875
[SHIBAZAKI] He started off
as a man with two legs,

339
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,208
however, after killing his
father and having intercourse

340
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,375
with his mother, he fell to the
level of a beast, so to speak.

341
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,750
That makes four.

342
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,625
In the end, he gouged
out his own eyes,

343
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,375
blinding himself.
He needed a cane to walk.

344
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,666
So, three legs.

[LISA panting]

346
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,041
[YOUNG MAN 2A]
Ah! Watch it!

347
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,000
[LISA]
I'm sorry!

348
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:58,041
[LISA panting]

349
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,416
It's true you may
be an accomplice.

350
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
[TWELVE]
You're not one of us, though.

351
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,166
[SHIBAZAKI]
So, we know it's Oedipus.

352
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,583
And what did they say?

353
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,875
"The riddle was for
everyone, but specifically

354
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,625
for the police?"

355
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,083
[SHIBAZAKI] In my opinion,
they're insinuating the bomb

356
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,708
has been planted
somewhere the police are.

357
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,458
The police?

358
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,583
[SHIBAZAKI] If that number
sequence is an address.

359
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,833
It corresponds with a
local police station.

360
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,750
Roppongi Station!

361
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:41,083
[phone ringing]

362
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,250
[TWELVE]
Nothing personal.

363
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,750
But one false move,
and I'll have to kill ya.

[DETECTIVE 2A] There's been
an explosion in Roppongi?

[OFFICERS clamoring]

369
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,708
Shibazaki! Roppongi's been hit!

370
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,500
Damn it. I was too late.

371
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,166
Huh?

372
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,375
[HAMURA]
Director!

373
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,541
There was an explosion
at Roppongi Station!

374
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,333
We should take this as a direct
challenge to the police force!

00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,500
[OKANO]
Hamura!

376
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,208
Head to Roppongi immediately!

377
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,625
[HAMURA]
Yes, sir!

378
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,041
Shibazaki, understand
what I am about

379
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,416
to tell you is
highly confidential.

Six months ago, a nuclear fuel

reprocessing facility in
Aomori was broken into.

382
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,708
The two criminals
stole plutonium.

[SHIBAZAKI gasps]

384
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,625
[KURAHASHI]
They vanished immediately,

385
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,375
and we have no leads.
However, they did leave

386
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,541
something at the
scene of the crime.

387
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,083
A message. The same
three letters

the government office.

Don't tell me.

[KURAHASHI]
That's right.

391
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,541
I think these guys
have every intention

392
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:06,458
of picking a fight with
this entire country.

393

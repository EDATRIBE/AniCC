interesting results.

25
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,041
This device was an
"ammonium nitrate

as an industrial explosive.

27
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,708

someone else's credit card info
to purchase the gunpowder.

How were they able to
use some else's credit card?

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,541
Probably through an illegal
website from Russia or China.

A clean card's info can be

[KINOSHITA] Because they used
a form of virtual currency

In addition, we have
the relevant usage history

They bought electrical tape

Entirely online, from Amazon.

has been deleted.

1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,416
I was just thinking,
maybe we should

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,791
stop this whole
thing altogether.

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,791
[SHIBAZAKI] To be clear,
if we don't figure this out

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,125
a lot of people are gonna die.

5
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,750

I don't care what happens to me

6
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,916
[FIVE]
Surprise sweetie,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,083
I don't care what
happens to you, either.

8
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,625
Back to the point.

9
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:25,333
You don't honestly think those

10
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,416
[TWELVE]

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,875
[NINE]
We can't afford to take chances.

12
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,041
We're running out of time!

13
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,500
[TWELVE]
I know that, too!

14
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,083
I'm going because
I'm out of time.

15
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,166
[doorbell rings]

16
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,458
I'll make the old man spill
everything he knows.

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,416
I'm Detective Shibazaki,
Metro P.D.

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,625
Might we have a few minutes
of your time, please?

22
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,041
Oh. Yeah, um.

23
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,208
[AOKI grunts]
Right this way.

24
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,875
[phone rings]

25
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,833
[HAMURA gasps]

26
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,208
[AOKI] Haven't used
this tea set in a while.

27
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,625
When you get to be my age,

28
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,375
visitors are few
and far between.

29
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:11,708
Especially now, ever since
my dear wife passed away.

30
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,541
I'm not surprised.
Always knew someone like you

31
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:21,500
would come for answers one day.
Well, get on with it.

32
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,333
I'll get straight
to the point, then.

33
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,291
Tell me what you know
about the Athena Plan.

34
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,000
[SHIBAZAKI] Your organization
gave an intelligence test

35
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,833
to all orphans in the country
under the age of five.

36
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,333
You gathered the top performers,
and erased all traces

37
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,666
of them from the record.

38
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,500
Or am I mistaken?

39
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,833
Have you ever heard the name
Shigeru Yamamoto before?

40
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,666
The former under-secretary
for Health and Welfare?

41
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,458
Yeah, he passed away
about three years ago.

42
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,958
[AOKI]
That's correct.

43
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,458
He died unexpectedly right
before he could report the truth

44
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,333
about what happened
to the authorities.

45
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,333
[HAMURA, SHIBAZAKI gasp]

46
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,666
[AOKI] If you'd still like to be
able to walk the streets

47
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,666
safely at night, it would be
prudent to go home now.

48
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,833
Hamura, you should
do as he says.

49
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,291
What, are you crazy?

50
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,750
After all this, there's no
way I'm wussin' out now!

51
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,583
[recorder beeps]

52
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,000
[AOKI] Are you familiar with
savant syndrome, detectives?

53
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,541
[SHIBAZAKI]
I think so.

54
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,541
Isn't that where someone has
extremely high brain function,

55
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,958
but only in specific areas
due to injury or autism.

56
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,875
[AOKI] Savants are known to
excel in mental arithmetic,

57
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,666
memorization, music, as well
as art and spatial skills,

58
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,041
to name a few.

59
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,833
Although these
abilities far exceed

60
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,666
an average person's in very
specific areas, many are unable

61
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,833
to reliably complete mundane
tasks, or even communicate

62
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,750
with the outside world.

63
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,583
To artificially reproduce
the exceptional abilities

64
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,750
found in these savants,
but without the deficits

65
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,666
commonly associated
with the syndrome.

66
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,708
That was the goal that
lead to the creation

67
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,958
of the Athena Plan.

68
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,291
Under government directive,

69
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,541
26 children total
were collected.

70
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,583
They were processed and
became test subjects.

71
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,333
Test subjects?

72
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,500
How is that kinda
thing even possible?

73
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,416
[AOKI] The theory behind
the whole experiment

74
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,708
was based on a new drug
accidentally developed

75
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,083
in the mid-90s by a Japanese
pharmaceutical company.

76
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,250
They stumbled across it while
researching brain function.

77
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,416
The Rising Peace Academy
saw the results

78
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,416
of the drug research.
Then, they pulled the strings

79
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,750
to set the
Athena Plan in motion.

80
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,500
That's right.

81
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,958
[AOKI] Funds were allocated
to create a remote facility,

82
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,916
where the test
subjects were kept.

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,541
It was known as
"The Settlement".

84
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,166
Ridiculous sums of money
were poured into that place.

85
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,125
Along with dozens
of the most talented

86
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,416
researchers in the country.

87
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,166
[AOKI]
The caveat,

88
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,666
this new "wonder drug" that
had fallen into our laps?

89
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,458
It was only effective on
the still-developing brains

90
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,625
of children under
the age of five.

91
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,791
Unfortunately,
the serum proved to be

92
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,250
highly volatile to the
biological systems

93
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,583
of the majority
of test subjects.

94
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,541
The bodies and minds
of these children

95
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,166
were severely
ravaged by the drug.

96
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,500
Most of them died
shortly after infusion.

97
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,625
I've heard enough!

98
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,958
How can you talk about this

99
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,250
--like it was nothing?
--[SHIBAZAKI] Hamura!

100
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:57,625
In the end. Athena was
labeled a complete failure.

101
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,375
The U.S. government
had become aware

102
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,541
of the program and intervened.

103
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,833
They shut the whole thing
down seven years ago.

104
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,041
Oh.

105
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,625
[AOKI]
Seems the tea's gotten cold.

106
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,250
[SHIBAZAKI]
So why?

107
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,208
Why did you wait until
now to come clean?

108
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,250
Honestly, if you
hadn't come along.

109
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,125
I'd have taken
everything I knew about

110
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,833
the Athena Plan to the grave.

111
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,791
Although, in all likelihood,

112
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,750
I imagine those
children would probably

113
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,416
not allow it to end that way.

114
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,083
[HAMURA, SHIBAZAKI grunt]

115
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,291
The moment I told you
'bout that damn project,

116
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,666
I painted a target
across my back. However,

117
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,958
I'm getting old and tired.
My body gets weaker every day.

118
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,250
I can feel it.
Not much time left.

119
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,000
And the children at the
Settlement. Where're they?

120
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,916
When it was shut down,
only one girl

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
had managed to survive
the various experiments.

122
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,291
One girl, taken into custody
by an American agency,

123
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,333
and the files sealed.

124
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,250
[SHIBAZAKI]
Interesting.

125
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,666
[AOKI]
Although...

126
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,916
[SHIBAZAKI]
"Although" what?

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,833
[AOKI] Apparently,
there was a report saying

128
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,083
two of the children managed
to escape the facility.

129
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,416
[HAMURA, SHIBAZAKI gasp]

130
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,708
Do you know their
names, by chance?

131
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,083
The subjects were
never assigned names.

132
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:21,791
Too empowering. Instead,
they were called by a number.

133
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,458
[AOKI] One of the boys
was number Nine.

134
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,500
The other was number Twelve.

135
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,791
They managed to start a fire,

136
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,375
then took the security systems
down to make their escape.

137
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,000
Clever little buggers.

138
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,750
When did all this go down?

139
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:41,458
Must've been eight years ago.
If those boys are still alive,

140
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,000
I guess they'd be about 17.

and chasing girls.

right to say that!

[AOKI] Yes. I stopped being
human a long time ago.

152

I was a pawn, a cog
in the great machine.

The orders came down from above.
I just followed them.

00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,125
Yeah, the guards conducting

155

said the same thing.

So you can save that
tired old bullshit.

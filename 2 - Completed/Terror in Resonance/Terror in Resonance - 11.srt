Is there a way to
use an atomic bomb

What?

58

Like, an atomic bomb explodes,
but without a single casualty.

00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,416
Is something like that possible?

60
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,750

I've heard of like,

00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,125

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,625
Oh, high altitude.

64
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,708
It'd be a nuclear explosion,
but instead of on land,

So the explosion will be
in the upper atmosphere.

103
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,291
The radiation will disperse out
into space, but in exchange,

104
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,125
it will most likely generate a
strong electromagnetic pulse.

[KURAHASHI]
And that means what?

106
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,458
Well, to put it simply,
if the pulse is strong enough,

107
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,083
it means it will
probably destroy

The grenade.
It was you, wasn't it?

174
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,791
Uh--

175
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,250
[NINE]
You're the only one who would

176
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,916
pull something like that.

177
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,875
Guess I owe you one.

00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,333
[SHIBAZAKI] Took long enough,
but I finally made it here.

187
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,291
This is your hometown, isn't it?

188
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,375
The place Sphinx
wanted everyone to see.

189
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,500
Well, you've definitely got
the whole world's attention.

190
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,958
They all wanna
know who you are,

191
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,708
where you came from.
Hell, media outlets

192
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,875
across the planet are
desperate to find out.

193
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,416
If you're caught,

194
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,666
everything that happened to
you will come out in the open.

195
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,666
It would have to.

196
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,750
At this point, you've created
such a fire-storm

197
00:15:55,833 --> 00:16:01,000
no one can ignore it anymore.
So the world is ready to listen.

198
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,958
Which, I'm assuming was
your goal the whole time.

199
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,375
Am I right?

200
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,208
Were you planning to be caught
from the very beginning?

201
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,708
Yeah, but we needed something.

202
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,708
Well, needed someone.

203
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:18,458
We couldn't be captured
if no one figured that out.

204
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:24,958
You were our Oedipus,
Shibazaki. It was always you.

205
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:29,166
All right, then. Sphinx,
you're under arrest!

206
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,000
About her, she's just a hostage.

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,458
I am holding a detonator.

214
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,458
While, the atomic bomb
may be no more,

215
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,541
there are countless others
like it in this country.

216
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,708
They're all over.

217
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,875
The one this detonator
is connected to,

218
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,208
is in a nuclear power plant!

[NINE] If the U.S. forces
do not withdraw.

222
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,291
I will set this off!

Correct, sir.

00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,458
That's what he's claimin'.

Carry out your duties.

226
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,291
But if we do--

227
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,958
[TRANSMISSION 11A]
The mere existence of someone

228
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,666
who knows the truth
about the airport

229
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,041
and the Shuto Expressway
incident puts us

230
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,500
at a disadvantage.
Even if the bomb is real,

231
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,083
nothing can be done
about it now.

232
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,500
Yes, sir.

00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,708
[TRANSMISSION 11A]
Don't kill the detective.

00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,083
If he accuses the
Japanese government,

235
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,291
it will turn attention
away from us.

236
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,750

I will make sure everything

comes to light in court.

I promise. The world

Thank you. But, I have
one more favor to ask.

254
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:38,750
Remember us.
Remember that we lived.

255
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,250
[LISA] I saw the entire
thing with my own eyes,

256
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,625
and I still couldn't
believe it was real.

257
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,208
A lot of people
came to ask me about it,

258
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,916
but I couldn't talk
about anything.

259
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,083
I thought for a while
I wouldn't be able to talk

260
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,625
for the rest of my life.

261
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,125
I was so sure about that, too,

262
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,416
but, gradually,
I got used to it.

263
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,750

knew what had happened,

00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,583

I'm always here if you need me.

Did I, did I tell you about
how Nine loved music?

[SHIBAZAKI]
No.

275
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,750
Well one time.

276
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,416
I asked him what he
was always listening to,

277
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,666
and he said it was music
from a "cold place".

278
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,750
Then, he told me it
was from Iceland.

279
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:07,041
V-O-N. It's an Icelandic word.
Have you heard of that before?

280
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,125
Nine told me it means "hope".

281
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,750
Of course.

282
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,750

Well, see ya.

283
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,583

Yeah. Be well.

1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,500
[NATSUMI] Oh, I see...

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,125
You want to know if
the new transfer

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,666
is the girl of your dreams, eh?

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,000
Adorable.

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,000
[NATSUMI] Wait for it...

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,166
[KEI, KOUSAKU, MINORI]
Miss Becky!

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,208
It's not so simple
as yes or no.

8
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,333
[KEI, KOUSAKU, MINORI]
Please, you're killing us!

9
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,000
[GUY A] So, Yukatan.

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,833
That is who you are, right?

11
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,375
[GUY B]
You'll have to excuse him.

12
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,666
What he means is,
you're that singer chick, right?

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,000
Not really.

14
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,666
Why you slumming it
in this dive?

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,125
I don't know.

16
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,250
[GUY C] Uh, all-righty then.

17
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,208
Truth is:

18
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,166
The new girl was pop
sensation Yuka Kusakabe,

19
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,166
but now she goes by
Ringo Kinoshita.

20
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,250
[KOUSAKU] Called it!

21
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,583
--[NATSUMI] Not so fast!
--[KOUSAKU] Huh?

22
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,458
[NATSUMI] It's safe to
assume she enrolled here

23
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,291
under a new name to put the
billboard days behind her.

24
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,791
Ah. I get it.

25
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,291
So, no bringing up
her past then.

26
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,083
Right.

27
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,291
But...

28
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,666
Come on!

29
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,500
Don't translate that to mean
"avoid her altogether."

30
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,208
The poor dear needs
help adjusting!

31
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,791
[KEI, KOUSAKU, MINORI]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:08,333
You want us to help this Ringo,
whatever-her-name is, fit in?

33
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,416
[NATSUMI] It'll be perfect!

34
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,291
She's in the same dorm
as you all.

35
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,833
[KEI, KOUSAKU, MINORI] What?

36
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,791
Plus you have the same major
and you're in the same class.

37
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,333
Oh, wow. How intelligent of me!

38
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,958
Let me get this straight:

39
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,208
We'll be attached at the hip?

40
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,500
So, like, on the farm?

41
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,208
And-And in the classroom?

42
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,625
And where 'at the hip'
can be taken literally?!

43
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,125
I'm dreaming this, aren't I?

44
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,583
[NATSUMI] No, it's real.

45
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,833
[screaming]

46
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,625
[KOUSAKU] Nosebleed!

47
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,166
[KOUSAKU] Pleased to
meet you, Miss Yukata--!

48
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,250
Uh, sorry, I mean:
Miss Kinoshita.

49
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,000
Ha. I'm Kousaku
Hata, so, uh, hi.

50
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,416
--[WAKA squeaks]
--Right, right.

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,791
Give me a sec.

52
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,625
This is my friend.
Wakadanna.

53
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,416
Or... Young Master.

54
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,208
[WAKA squeaks]

55
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,583
Anyway.

56
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,625
Let me be the first to welcome
you to Tamo No-Rin,

57
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,166
where everyone's
a team player!

58
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,208
Is he talking like a
recruiter or is it just me?

59
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,375
Um, I think he's trying
to sound smart.

60
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,541
[KOUSAKU] Tour-time!

61
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,333
There'll be a quiz
afterwards-not really.

62
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,958
This is the main building.

63
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,500
Classes are divided up
by department.

64
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,125
[KOUSAKU] Here we have the gym.

65
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,625
[KOUSAKU] The complex of
buildings to our right

66
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,916
has kind of a tricky name.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,750
We call it the Industrial
Promotion Building.

68
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,291
Bit of a mouthful, huh?

69
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,583
[KOUSAKU] There's the Green
Shop, like the sign says.

70
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,375
That's where we sell all
of our vegetables and stuff.

71
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,041
I know.

72
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,833
[KOUSAKU] Uh... Ah, cool.

73
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,291
[PEACOCK A cries]

74
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,333
A cat?

75
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,375
Uh...

76
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,875
No, that'd be a peacock.

77
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,791
[PEACOCK A caws]

78
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,458
[PEACOCK B cries]

79
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,625
[RINGO] It's so drab.

80
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,416
Oh. Right, I get you.

81
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,041
See when we think of a peacock,
we think of the males.

82
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,333
In nature,

83
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,916
it's the guys who have to
deck themselves out.

84
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,291
Girls are... Drab.

85
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,583
[KOUSAKU gasps]

86
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,583
[KOUSAKU] Nice move,
doofus! You're losing her!

87
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,125
[KOUSAKU]
This is the Wallaby House.

88
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,750
It's where Wakadana lives.

00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,750
[WAKA squeaks]

90
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,541
[KOUSAKU]
Heated flooring, AC...

91
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,958
It's actually a lot
nicer than our dorms.

[WAKA squeaks]

93
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,500
So, Wakadana's not a kangaroo?

94
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,125
Well, they are similar,
but not quite the same.

95
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,291
So, uh...

96
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,833
Yeah.

97
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,541
If you're interested, I could
tell you about how Wakadana

98
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,375
and me became buddies
back in the day.

[WAKA squeaks]

100
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,083
He didn't used to be
attached to us.

101
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,500
But then one night, actually,
it was Christmas just last year.

102
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,625
Either 'cause he was tired
of being cooped up

103
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,708
or just couldn't sleep,
the little fella got out

104
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,750
and wandered around in
the snow until, well,

105
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,416
until it got to be
too much for him.

106
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,625
[KOUSAKU] Luckily, I was
wandering around myself

107
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,791
and found him.

108
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,333
Took him to my room
as fast as I could.

109
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,250
[WAKA squeaks weakly]

110
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,750
[KOUSAKU] He slept cuddled
up next to me inside my...

111
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,833
Uh... Inside a big pillowcase.

112
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,625
We've been pals ever since.

113
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,958
When he gets bored,

114
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,083
he comes over to hang out
with me and the gang.

115
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,208
Pretty heartwarming story, huh?

116
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,750
[KOUSAKU whimpers]

117
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,666
[KOUSAKU yells]

118
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,000
Continuing the tour!

119
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,875
Feast your eyes on that!

120
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,416
That's what quality
poultry looks like

121
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,458
when it's too good
for plebeians!

122
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,625
The three breeds of
locally raised poultry are:

123
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,708
Hinai, Nagoya Cochin,
and the superlative Satsuma.

124
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,458
Less famous, perhaps,
but of equal merit

125
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,208
is the poultry raised here in
our very own Gifu prefecture

126
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,583
submitted for your
unqualified appraisal.

127
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,458
[MINORI] Very nice. Let's eat!

128
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,333
Well done. Thank you.

129
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,541
Why...

130
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,291
Don't speak to me as
though my self-esteem

131
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,833
as an animal
husbandry specialist

132
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,291
hinges on your approval!

133
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,083
Consider yourself
blessed that I deign

134
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,541
to let you sample
my wares at all!

135
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,666
She's so mean. Why?

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,250
I beg your pardon?!

137
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,375
If you're trying to insinuate
that I have unrequited feelings

138
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,416
for Kei, you're barking up
the wrong tree!

139
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,791
That's not to suggest I haven't
a modicum of respect

140
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:19,875
for the man.

141
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,916
But I regard him
primarily as a rival!

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,208
Uh, any chance
I can have some eggs?

143
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:24,875
[KOCHOU gasps]

144
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,416
Vulgarian...

145
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
[KOUSAKU] Let me ask you.

146
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,291
Between fertilized
and unfertilized,

147
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,708
which kind of egg is more, I
guess, you know,

148
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,791
better for you?

149
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,500
[KOCHOU] Moron!

150
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,625
How do you call yourself an
Ag Major and sleep at night?!

151
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,083
Nutritionally, there is
no difference between the two.

152
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,750
That said, let there be no
question that eggs produced

153
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,833
by caged fowl, when
compared to those produced

154
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,375
by the free-range variety,
are enormously less delectable.

155
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,208
Sorry. Thanks for explaining.

156
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,500
Hey.

157
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,250
"Unfertilized egg" means what?

[KOUSAKU gasps]

159
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,583
[RINGO] Look.

160
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,166
I'm from the city, okay? I don't
know the first thing about eggs.

161
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,458
Wow, that is seriously adorable!

162
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,583
This stuff is so... boring.

00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,083
No!

00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,041
Anyway...

Unfertilized, means?

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,250
Well, I, uh...

167
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,166
Give me a sec to explain!

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,416
Okay, I'm not going to lie:

169
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,416
I don't even know where
to start on this one.

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,708
What are you talking about?

171
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,750
You know this: just start
from the beginning.

172
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,166
[KOUSAKU] Look at her!
She's too delicate!

173
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,250
This is down and dirty stuff
she's asking about.

174
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,750
I can't just go there.

175
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,833
Oh, spare me!
It's a clinical matter.

176
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,541
Be clinical. The principle's
the same for plants.

177
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,166
Think, pistil and stamen.

178
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,291
[KOUSAKU] What I think is that

179
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,125
she ought to hear it
from another girl.

180
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,125
[KOCHOU] Fine!

181
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,416
Behold, rookie!

182
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,166
[RINGO] Yeah?

183
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,708
If you would, madam.

184
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,416
Your undivided attention.

185
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,666
[KOUSAKU] Yes!

186
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,000
An unfertilized egg

187
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,208
is essentially an egg
wearing a condom!

188
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
[NATSUMI]
The first order of business

189
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,583
when it comes to Agriculture
is record keeping.

190
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,333
That's the last time
I ask Fun Bags

191
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,041
to explain anything to anyone.

192
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,333
Sweetie, you've heard
the phrase

193
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,583
"putting all your eggs
in one basket," yes?

194
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,541
[RINGO] Fertilizing them?

195
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,250
No, not exactly.

196
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,458
What I'm getting at here

197
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,333
is the importance of
playing fast and loose!

198
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,875
[KOUSAKU screams]

199
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,416
[NATSUMI] What the experts say
about the same-old, same-old

200
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,208
is true. For example: When a
grown man practices monogamy.

201
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:09,958
Yeah, right.

202
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:10,958
His wife--

203
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,291
Whoa, there!

204
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,583
Kind of an inappropriate
example, don't you think?

205
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,791
[NATSUMI] What? She's a girl.
She needs to know.

206
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,250
You might be going off
on a tangent.

207
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,750
[NATSUMI] The point
I'm getting at is,

208
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,958
when we re-use the
same soil year after year,

209
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,541
eventually the crop won't take.

210
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,666
The concept is known
as replant failure.

211
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,000
Simple as that.

212
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:29,791
Huh?

213
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,625
Replant failure!

214
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,833
Simple as that!

215
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,750
Yes. Thank you! Awesome!

216
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,958
[KOUSAKU coughs]

217
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,541
If you'll excuse me,
I'd like to propose a toast.

218
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,250
As dorm leader,
it's my privilege

219
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,250
to welcome Miss Kinoshita
into the fold.

220
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,500
--We're very happy to--
--[KEI, RINGO, MINORI] Cheers!

221
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,583
Dang it, guys!

222
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,125
[MINORI] I vote
we stuff our faces! Heh.

223
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,791
There's really not a
whole heck of a lot to do

224
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,208
in a po-dunk town like this.

225
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,208
But, there's enough fresh grub
to feed an army!

226
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,833
This is way too much for me.

227
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,500
Oh. Well...

228
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,291
Is it just me, or is she
being kind of bitchy?

229
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,791
Come on! Give her chance.

230
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,958
She's probably just nervous.
Wouldn't you be?

231
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,500
[MINORI] Maybe, but either way,

232
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,916
you wouldn't be the only human
being I bothered talking to.

233
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,291
Heh heh! Ah...
You noticed that, huh?

234
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,958
Ugh. Please! Idiot.

235
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,291
Her attitude's not exactly
going to help her fit in.

236
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,166
Look, if your girlfriend
wants to cut it here,

237
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,625
she needs to learn
how to play ball!

238
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,500
Huh. Guess you have a point.

239
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,583
[MINORI] What you need to do is
stop fan-boying long enough

240
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,708
to set an example.
Quit trying to schmooze,

241
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,583
and get her familiar
with how things work.

242
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,666
[KOUSAKU] I know that, I'm
just... I'm establishing trust.

243
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,875
Who wants to see an impression?

244
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,083
Ha! Yeah!

245
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,083
Helium-filled sex doll.

246
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,041
[KOUSAKU &amp; MINORI] Woo-hoo!

00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,500
[KEI coughs]

248
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,958
[KEI] I have daddy issues.

249
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,041
[KOUSAKU] Woo-hoo...

250
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,750
[MINORI] Yeah... Woo-hoo...

251
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,875
[KEI] All right, then.
Another one.

252
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,333
I give you "cock of the walk!" 

253
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:55,875
[KOUSAKU] Nope!

254
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:59,166
[KEI grunting]

255
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,083
[KEI]
Overreact there much, chief?

256
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,625
No more impressions!
It's game time!

257
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,291
In fact, why don't we
let the new girl

258
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,208
pick what she'd like to play?

259
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,250
Uh...

260
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,208
How about "Who's the King?"

261
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,458
[KOUSAKU &amp; MINORI] Huh?

262
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,708
[ALL] Red straw's the King!

263
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,291
Ha-ha! The red one's mine!

264
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,583
[KOUSAKU] Kei's got one.

265
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:26,000
Pretty sure that signal
means Minori has three.

266
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,875
Yes! This is my chance!

267
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,208
As King, I command
whoever has Number Two

268
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,708
to feed me by hand!

269
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,625
Oh. Glad that's not weird.

270
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,833
[KOUSAKU grunts]

271
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,541
Damn it! How did you
end up with Number Two?!

272
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,583
I'm not any happier
about it than you are!

273
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,625
I was trying to signal you
that Ringo had three.

274
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,916
if it'd been a snake,
it would've bit you!

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,666
Your secret code is stupid!

276
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,000
[KEI] Quit stalling
and play the game.

277
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,416
The King asked to be fed.

278
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,041
[MINORI] Your Highness...

00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,166
[KOUSAKU] Ahh...

280
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,416
Heh...

281
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,708
Glad we're not playing
spin-the-bottle, huh?

00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,750
[MINORI laughs]

283
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,875

[KOUSAKU] Tee-hee.

286
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,583
Yes. Exactly as planned.

287
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:19,041
As king, I command Number Three
to step on my face barefoot!

288
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,833
Ugh. Is something wrong with you
or do you just hate me?

289
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,875
[KOUSAKU] No!

290
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,333
[KOUSAKU grunts]

291
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,333
I... hate my life!

292
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,250
If you're going to
signal me, be consistent!

293
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,041
Uh-uh, don't pin this
one on me!

294
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,583
Did you or did you not
say my secret code

295
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,958
was stupid last time?

296
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,166
Whatever, just do it!

297
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,541
Step on my face!

298
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:39,041
You really need to see
a therapist at some point.

299
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's get this over with...

300
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,375
[KOUSAKU] Do it quick.

301
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,083
[KOUSAKU whimpers]

302
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:53,125
[quiet giggling]

303
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,750
[MINORI] I don't know
what this is doing for you

304
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,000
and I don't need to know.

305
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,416
Let's just agree
never to speak of this again.

306
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,333
[KEI] You're a good sport,
Minori. Heh.

307
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,833
You know what they say,
"the more you stomp it,

308
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,416
the bigger the barley grows."

309
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,083
[MINORI] Nobody says that.

310
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,500
Okay, that's enough!

311
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,958
Right. That looked bad.

312
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,000
But... I swear!

Looks like it's me.

317
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,416
Oh. Yay.

318
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,416
It's you.

319
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,583
Huh. Nice...

320
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,833
Uh, is something the matter?

321
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,291
No, I'm good.

00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,833
What're you?

00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,708
Huh?

00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,958
I can't just tell you!
That takes the fun out of it.

326
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,000
What number do you have?

327
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,250
Eh! Uhm... One. But
this is against the rules.

[RINGO sighs]

329
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,833
[RINGO] Number One has to
call me by my first name.

00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,416
[KOUSAKU] You...
You'd be okay with that?

331
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,375
I mean, we only just met.

332
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,833
[RINGO] It's Ringo, by the way.

333
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,166
[KOUSAKU] Yeah... I-I know.

334
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,791
Good.

335
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,541
Call me that from now on.

a load of the dream I had.

transferred here from Tokyo

and was totally putting
the moves on me

playing "Who's the Ki--".

your dream girl's.

527
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,541
These, on the other hand!

528
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,250
[KOUSAKU] So I basically just
buried my nose in your...

529
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,000
Afraid so.

530
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,416
[KOUSAKU] How could you?

531
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,333
I thought you were my friend?

532
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,208
You've tricked me! Why?

533
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,500
[BOTH gasp]

534
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,000
[KOUSAKU] What have I done
to deserve this...?

535
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,750
This was all on purpose!

536
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,541
Bastard! You knew exactly
what you were doing!

537
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:10,166
You've turned this laundry room
into a den of lies!

538
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,083
[KOUSAKU sobs]

539
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,833
C'mon, man get a grip, already.

540
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,875
Let this be a lesson to you that
not all used panties

541
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,083
have seen the kind of trenches
you're interested in.

542
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,291
Then tell me....

543
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,958
How's a man supposed
to judge quality?

544
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,708
There's no surefire way.

545
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,208
Value is in the eye
of the beholder.

546
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,541
[MINORI] Why do you sound
like a guru all of a sudden?

547
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,875
[RINGO] I don't understand.

548
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,208
[KEI] Consider this:

549
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,833
Stop thinking in terms
of the panties themselves.

550
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,583
The only pair worth its weight
in gold is the pair unseen.

551
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:44,208
The one thing we're drawn
to without fail is mystery.

552
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,708
Once we've seen them they're
just a run-o'-the-mill fact.

553
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,041
What they are is nothing
compared to what they represent.

554
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,833
That's really deep...

555
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,000
So, one in the hand is...

556
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,958
Is worth none in the bush.

557
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,916
Wow, I... I was jerk.

558
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,625
Sorry I threw them away.

559
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,333
I didn't understand
their panty power.

560
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,000
Nah, I was the jerk.

561
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,250
I didn't understand
any better than you.

562
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,416
[KEI] There, that's the spirit.

563
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,375
Glad you two remember
how to be friends.

564
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,666
Since my work's done,

565
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,416
I'll be taking Kinoshita's
panties for myself.

566
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,291
[KOUSAKU] What?!

567
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,416
You dirty double-crossing--!

568
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,750
[KOUSAKU grunts]

569
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,083
[KEI] Stop belly-aching!
You already have your own!

570
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,750
Huh? What are you talking about?

571
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,833
[KEI] The ones in your heart...

572
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,291
[KOUSAKU gasps]

573
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,125
[KOUSAKU] Of course!

574
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,208
They've been with me
from the beginning!

575
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,333
Everyone carries their own
high-quality pair

576
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,750
of ladies' unmentionables
in their heart!

577
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,166
Guys! Let's hang these up like
banners and have a party!

578
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,666
A Spring-line Panties Party!

579
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,416
I'll make my special red rice!

580
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
[laughing]

581
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,500
Yo, sweetheart--you in
or you out?

582
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
[RINGO] You guys are all idiots!

583
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,750
[ALL whimper]

584
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,666
[KOUSAKU] And so our
Spring-Line Panties Party ended.

585
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,000
About five seconds
after it started.

586
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,250
But, man, it was fun!

587
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,083
[KOUSAKU] "Super Sub-Mom War:
Training Stage"

1
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,958
[KOUSAKU] I am so tired.

2
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,875
Changing outta these clothes
and grabbing some dinner

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,875
sounds awesome right about now.

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,875
[screams]

5
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,208
[KOUSAKU] Where are my
Yukatan posters?!

6
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,583
My Yukatan wall scrolls?!
My Yukatan body pillow?!

7
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,708
My Yukata DVD and
BluRay collection?!

8
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,500
My scrapbook of
Yukatan-related news articles?!

9
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,041
[KOUSAKU screams]

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,708
Yeah, Dumped them
in the furnace.

11
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,083
Don't say I never
do nothing for you.

12
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,458
[KOUSAKU] What would possess you
to burn my posters?!

13
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,291
Hey! Would you feel
comfortable in a room

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,375
with pictures of you
all over the damn wall?!

15
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,166
I did you a favor so
your dream girl won't freak out.

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,750
She doesn't need to know
how obsessed you are.

17
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,708
And besides, your mom
begged me to do something.

18
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,333
I promised her I'd watch
your back out here,

19
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,125
so get used to it.

20
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,833
Well. You could've asked.

21
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,208
[MINORI] Don't read too much
into it 'cause just so you know

22
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,041
I'm going to do everything
in my power to make sure

23
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,416
you never hook up
with that little slut.

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,000
Believe me,
I know why she's here.

25
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,166
And if Little Miss Pop Sensation
thinks this is the place

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,791
to stink up her
would-be green thumb,

27
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,250
she's got another thing coming!

28
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,250
--That doesn't even make sense.
--Oh, doesn't it?!

29
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,708
Whatever, who cares?!

30
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,458
Her first time working the farm
is supposed to be

31
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,875
tomorrow morning, correct?

32
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,375
I think so.

33
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,875
Well, Her Highness is
due for a trial by fire!

34
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,500
Hmph!

35
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:21,583
Alrighty then.

36
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,125
Does that mean
what I think it does?!

37
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,458
'Cause if the girl I've known
since we were playing doctor

38
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,000
has it in for the girl
who made my gonads drop...

39
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,708
Not that I'm proud of this,
but the whole thing might be

40
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,958
a little too hot
for me to handle.

41
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,875
[MINORI] Huh. I give her credit
for even bothering to show up.

42
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,166
[KOUSAKU] Yeah?

43
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,500
Well if she knew you were
planning to put her

44
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,666
through her paces,
she probably wouldn't have.

45
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,666
[sighs] Of all the
days for Kei to be out

46
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,208
on a welding gig for
shop class. This is balls.

47
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,375
I will own this whore!

48
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,583
Why do I always end up having to
deal with this crap by myself?

49
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,833
That didn't take long.

50
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,291
Don't be shy.

51
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,791
C'mon down and show us all
how you look in the uniform.

52
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,250
Sure thing.

53
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,125
[screams]

54
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,958
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

55
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,750
She looks like... She looks
like a tentacle magnet!

56
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,833
Huh.

57
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:45,958
Must've given her
the wrong outfit.

58
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,458
In what way exactly
does that suit

59
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,083
of comic-shop stripper-pole
armor look anything

60
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,500
like one of our work uniforms?!

61
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,666
I know what you're up to
and it's just wrong!

62
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,875
Ugh. What I'm up to
is for her own good. Hmph.

63
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,541
She can't work in that!

64
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,083
She'd better learn how quick,

65
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,250
'cause the first test she's got
is coping with distraction!

66
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,500
If she wants to work the earth,

67
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,208
she's got to get over
caring how she looks!

68
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,625
All the more reason
not to stuff her into

69
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,458
something out of
an online fan fic!

70
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,833
This whole thing is ridiculous,
I'm putting my foot down!

71
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,166
I'm okay.

72
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,541
See? She's down with this.

73
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,083
Now then.

74
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,083
Just to show you
I'm a good sport...

75
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,791
[screams]

76
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,500
Yup. Say hi-di-ho to girl power!

77
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,833
Hyah!

78
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:22,625
Hey!

79
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,958
--Wha--?!
--Whoa-whoa!

80
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:24,916
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,416
I... can't... take it!

82
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,958
[screams]

83
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,750
Whoa. This is so hot!

84
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,791
Yeah, no. Rein it
in there a bit, tiger.

85
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,583
Huh? Wait. No!
That just came out!

86
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,291
[KOUSAKU whimpers]

87
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,791
[RINGO] Hmph.

88
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,041
Heh! You know,
Miss Kinoshita,

89
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,916
if you're self-conscious
you can back out now.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,375
Like hell.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,791
[KEI] Of course.

92
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,541
[KOUSAKU] Holy crap,
it's a Paladin!

93
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,708
Or just Kei. Seriously, dude?
A suit of armor?

94
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,916
I thought you were
supposed to be out welding.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,375
[KEI] I felt a disturbance
in the force.

96
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,166
And I like to watch.

97
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,625
[MINORI]
Welcome to the Cucumber House.

98
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,250
Hey, Yukatan.
Can I get an autograph?

99
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,958
Screw her, man,
look at this one!

100
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,333
Now that's some produce!

101
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,166
The First job's a cinch.

102
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,416
All you have to do is check
the leaves for diseases

103
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,458
and what not.
See any bugs having a party,

104
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,875
you pick 'em off. Understood?

105
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,958
I'll play nice and
give you the row on the left.

106
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,250
One on the right's mine.

107
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,125
Battle starts
when Kousaku says go.

108
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,666
If he can do it
without drooling.

109
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,208
[KOUSAKU] Wait, why me?

110
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,583
[MINORI] Go on. It's the easiest
job in the world, I promise.

111
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,375
Okay fine, whatever.
Just do it.

112
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,708
And they're off!
In full cosplay!

113
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,875
[KEI] Minori's a sneaky one
when she wants to be.

114
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,916
Huh?

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,291
[KEI] Don't get me wrong,

116
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,791
cucumber's a beginner plant,
sure. We all know that,

117
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,250
it's just...

118
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,958
If you're not ready for the
prickly bits on the leaves

119
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,500
and stems, that stuff
can sting like a mother.

120
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,541
[KOUSAKU] Are you saying
Minori put her in bikini armor

121
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,416
on purpose to get her pricked?!

122
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,958
[KEI] Minori knows her cucumber;
she's used to it.

123
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,875
City gal like Ringo, though.

124
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,208
I'd say she's in
for a rude awakening.

125
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,458
[KOUSAKU] Wow. Look at her go!
She's a demon!

126
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,583
[STUDENTS laughing, cheering]

127
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,666
[KEI] Game over, man.

128
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,083
Wait. No. Not yet.

129
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,916
Not until Minori
wipes the floor with her.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ahh... Oh, right.
I totally forgot.

131
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,250
Yuka may be naturally immune
to the prickly bits.

132
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,791
But what about the caterpillars?

133
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:25,875
[KEI] Bingo.

134
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,000
Those things make even

135
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,083
a seasoned cumcumber-er's
skin crawl.

136
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,125
[screaming]

137
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,500
And now we see
what she's made of.

138
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,291
No! She's too wet
behind the ears for this!

139
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,500
Get an eyeful of those
cute little buggy-wuggies

140
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,958
and bawl yourself sick.

141
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,500
"Um. Bye, everybody:
I'm going back to the Big City

142
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,083
where the only insects I
have to worry about are flies!"

143
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,500
[STUDENTS] Whooa!

144
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,000
[GUY 3B] Oh snap. Keinez
the Catalyst goes Oratorio!

145
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,875
That's what you call the power
of bikini armor, guys!

146
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,833
[KEI] Of course! Ringo's never
seen a caterpillar before!

147
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,625
How would she know
to be grossed out by one?!

148
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,250
She's too innocent and pure
to realize how vile they are!

149
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,416
Oh my glob, this is amazing!

150
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,250
[KOUSAKU] Whoa! She's closing
the distance between them

151
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,041
--like nobody's business!
--Nice try, sister,

152
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,750
but I didn'tt sign on to be the
laughing stock of my peers!

153
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,083
[MINORI growls]

154
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,625
Clear! Clear!

155
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,541
Clear-clear-clear-clear-clear-
clear-clear-clear-clear...!

156
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,166
[gasping]

157
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,666
Clear!

158
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,166
Photo finish!

159
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,958
Nuh-uh, dude:
Nakazawa won by a nose!

160
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,958
[screams]

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,833
Bag, please.

162
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,416
Heh! Yeah, well don't rest
on your laurels just yet.

163
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,416
This battle is far from over.

164
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,625
[MINORI] Next up,
we have the Hen House!

165
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,916
[KEI] Alongside rice farming,
cleaning the chicken coops

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,750
is the most important part of a
freshman Ag student's training.

167
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,750
If you can handle what's on
the other side of that door,

168
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,500
you can handle anything.

169
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,791
Good luck in there!

170
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,166
[KEI] Hens are a barnyard
predator's dream.

171
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,625
If we didn't
keep them penned up,

172
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,208
we'd have nothing but bones
and feathers come morning.

173
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,583
The coops are great,

174
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,500
but the downside is they're
humid and, well, cooped.

175
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,125
First one of us to
make the floor shine

176
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,250
without losing her lunch
takes home the gold!

177
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,333
Feathers got to go.
Food scraps got to go.

178
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,291
Poop's got to go.

179
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,041
And if feathers, food scraps,
and poop are too much for you,

180
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,083
you've got to go.

181
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,166
[MINORI laughs]

182
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,958
[GUY 3D] Whoa!
It's nothing to her.

183
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,500
She's acclimated to the smell!

184
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,416
[GUY 3E] Don't call it yet!

185
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,666
We're still just
getting started!

186
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,208
That's right.

187
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,250
The putrid aroma is only the
beginning of her season in hell!

188
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,791
[KEI] The smell you deal with.
The heat you deal with.

189
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:45,791
But then...

190
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,250
Abandon all hope
ye who enter here!

191
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,750
Oh. Hey, hon?
I love the energy,

192
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,041
but I think you might've
overlooked something important.

193
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,916
Can't forget about
the feed stall, can we?

194
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,333
--[buzzing]
--[KOUSAKU] Aah!

195
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,833
--[buzzing]
--Whoa!

196
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,666
--[buzzing]
--Aaagh!

197
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,625
[BOTH scream]

198
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,208
It's like a cockroach Armageddon
every time we open that door!

199
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,583
Just think about it, man:

200
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,083
Darkness, humidity, an
all-you-can eat poop buffet.

201
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,416
This is paradise for them!

202
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,208
[laughs] That's right!

203
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,583
Dealing with cockroaches
is part of the job!

204
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,125
Admit defeat and I'll help you
clean them out.

205
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,791
[GUYS screaming]

206
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,208
[GIRLS screaming]

207
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,083
[GUY 3D] Ewww!
She's stepping on them!

208
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,416
[GUY 3E] I'm going to say
what we're all thinking

209
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,875
and call this beyond gross.

210
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,791
Disqualification! Y-You're
supposed to be freaking out!

211
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,250
Sorry.

212
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,250
So, is that it?

213
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,708
[gasping]

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,125
[KEI] And the winner is,
Ringo Kinoshita!

215
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:55,833
Huh?!

216
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:56,958
Nice.

217
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,000
No! Not yet!
She isn't done!

218
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,791
Minori, please.
Give it up.

219
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,625
We still have to test her
most basic agricultural skill!

220
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,833
Trial by Rice Field!

221
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:06,916
Rice field?

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,375
Oh, yes!

223
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,083
Rice has been a vital part
of the Rising Sun experience

224
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,458
since the Yayoi Period!

225
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,208
You can't claim to know
what it is to be Japanese

226
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,833
until you've gotten your
feet wet! I defy you to try!

227
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,416
Only after you've mastered
our landscaping and

228
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,708
dietary epicenter will I allow
you to count yourself worthy!

229
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,250
[KEI] Uh. Don't oversell it.

230
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,125
Or, stop talking
outta your ass.

231
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,833
Argue all you want.
History is on my side!

232
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,208
But don't worry.

233
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,666
Back out now and I'll
spare you the embarrassment!

234
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,541
Bring it.

235
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,166
Someone's feeling feisty, huh?

236
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,166
[sighs]

237
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,875
All-righty, then.

238
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,708
So, meet at the rice fields
Saturday morning

239
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,916
dressed in clothes you don't
mind getting water-logged.

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,375
Woo-hoo.

241
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,541
[KOUSAKU] This field's roughly
one tenth of a hectare.

242
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,291
That's about a
thousand square meters.

243
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,708
[KEI] It takes four people
half a day to plant rice.

244
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,375
Hah! Prepare to watch me set
a new world record, losers!

245
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,875
Um. Before we get started
I'd like to clarify something.

246
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,583
Usually when you're
about to take the plunge.

247
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,541
It's a good idea to dress in
clothes appropriate to the task.

248
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,708
But, uh... Seriously,
you guys, this is just...

249
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,083
I mean, c'mon.

250
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,333
Sorry. Should I change?

251
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,708
Nah, it's okay. No worries.

252
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,166
You definitely rack up points
for thinking ahead.

253
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,791
And looking fly!

254
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,541
You, however!

255
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,958
What's wrong?

256
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,541
What do you mean "What's wrong?"
Have you seen yourself?!

257
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,791
I mean, okay, yes, technically
it is a bathing suit,

258
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,875
so it qualifies as appropriate
for getting wet in and all.

259
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,083
But, other than that,

260
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,583
nothing about what you
have on isn't wrong!

261
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,375
I can't un-see this,
man! Not cool!

262
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,625
[KEI chuckles]

263
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,458
Well you'd be the first
to want to un-see it.

264
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,833
Don't even! That's just...

265
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,791
Where do you go
that people encourage this?!

266
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's just say
somewhere popular.

267
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,416
And sopping wet.

268
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,833
Mah! Never mind, dude!

269
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,166
Everybody loves to see
the Gaisenmon.

270
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,458
Whoa, highbrow!

271
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,916
That's like a French English
play on words, bro.

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,833
It's a combo of English for dude
and French for Arc of Triumph!

273
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,208
That's why Kei's a trailblazer

274
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,833
and we're just
a couple of followers!

275
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,375
I'm just happy we get to
bask in his presence!

276
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,666
Look, Kei.

277
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,333
I'm not trying to tell you
what to wear, but...

278
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,458
I mean we got to consider
the ladies, right?

279
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,625
Poor Ringo doesn't need to--

280
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,625
Give me a second,
I'm in the middle of something.

281
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,833
[GUYS] Kei is a living god!

282
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,291
Wait, don't encourage him!

283
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,958
Hey! I see you there!

284
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,791
That's the point, silly!

285
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,041
[KOUSAKU]
Has the world gone mad?

286
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,625
This is an Ag school,
you're a teacher here!

287
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,250
Why would you wear something
like that to farm in?

288
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,541
Oh, sweetie.

289
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,125
Wedding dresses
are meant to get soiled.

290
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,708
I'ma need you to not
elaborate on that, please!

291
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:25,750
Uh-oh. Have I crossed a line?
I'm such a naughty girl.

292
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,416
Somebody really needs to
teach the teacher a lesson.

293
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,125
Okay, you're like a hundred
years old and that's super bleh.

294
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,875
But the experts say
I'm at my peak.

295
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,833
[KOUSAKU] Stop hitting on
your students and go home!

296
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,125
We don't need you to supervise!

297
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,500
Oh stop playing hard to get:

298
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,291
this is every
teenage boy's fantasy.

299
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,625
[KOUSAKU]
I just want to plant rice!

300
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,750
Why is that so
difficult to let me do?!

301
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,375
I don't need this!
I don't deserve this!

302
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,083
You'll never sow your seed in
a field wetter than this MILF,

303
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,291
lover boy!!

304
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,791
[KOUSAKU screams]

305
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,541
How has the school board not
axed you twice-over by now?!

306
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,875
[GUYS] Whooaa...

307
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,416
You're only a MILF
if you actually have children!

308
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Thank you. That was, uh,
that was getting kind of weird.

309
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,333
[MINORI] Hmm. Meh.
Minori's got your back.

310
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,000
Hey, Minori? What're those?

311
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,458
What? Bloomers.

312
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,375
Wait...

313
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,625
Did you...?

314
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,541
[KOUSAKU] Behold.

315
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:21,208
A deeper shade of blue than sky
on a Spring Afternoon. Wow.

316
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,208
Okay, I'm not trying to say
they're hideous or anything.

317
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,958
But what's the story
with these things?

318
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,500
You've read the
student handbook, right?

319
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,083
Girls are supposed
to wear shorts.

320
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,250
It's no big deal.

321
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,208
I had them sent to me
special for today.

322
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:33,958
No joke?!

323
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,375
Whoa! Historic!

324
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,583
I can't remember the last time
I saw a pair like these.

325
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,500
Didn't know they
were still a thing.

326
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,125
They're not new or anything.

327
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,250
Just a hand-me-down
from my sisters.

328
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,208
Damn it, Minori,
what is wrong with you?!

329
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,583
What?

330
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,166
I was adjusting the hem
to cover up a mosquito bite.

331
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,333
Well, it's mighty suggestive!
When you're dressed like that,

332
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,875
there's just
some things you can't do!

333
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,250
Hems have been playing
fast and loose

334
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,541
with men's short-term memory
since the caveman days!

335
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,500
The bloomers are too much!
Disqualification!

336
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,250
Control yourself
for five minutes

337
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,791
and they wouldn't be an issue.

338
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,166
Creep.

339
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,916
Whoa, whoa! Don't turn this
into a feminist rant.

340
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,791
You chose them!

341
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,458
Deal with it, pervert!

342
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,916
Wait. What the-- What do
you think you're doing?!

343
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,333
[GUYS] Yeah! Show us some of
that sweet swimsuit action!

344
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,333
[KEI] School swim team uniform.

345
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,125
Bold choice. Very "kyu-suku."

346
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,291
Kyu-suku?

347
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,541
--Now listen closely.
--[KOUSAKU yells]

348
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,541
Kyu-suku refers to a
popular old style swimsuit.

349
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,000
The distinguishing feature of
its design is the crotch area

350
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,791
being divided into
two discreet regions.

351
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,541
This ingenious shape
allowed the wearer

352
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,166
greater flexibility both in
and outside of the pool.

353
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,625
it also protected
the susceptible

354
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,875
female nether regions
from getting water-logged.

355
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,416
Form and function combined
to make a truly wonderful thing.

356
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Yep, this beaut
was a game-changer.

357
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,833
Wow. You guys know water sports.

358
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,541
Well, either way
I'm a fan of the style.

359
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,500
It's just the right balance
of functional and girlie.

360
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,875
And I know nothing
about fashion.

361
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm just shooting from the hip.

362
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,708
Don't look at me like that.

363
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,708
[gasps] My bad! I, uh...

364
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,458
I just think
you look great in that.

365
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,125
I mean it totally
suits your curves.

366
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,666
Kind of makes you
look like a model.

367
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,666
[gasps] You... pervert.

368
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,666
[gasps] Forgive me!
I won't look anymore promise!

369
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,125
Chauvinist!

370
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,750
Please. Ladies,
you got to stop this.

371
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,291
The landscape students
are gawking.

372
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,916
Is it too much to ask
that we all just get along?

373
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,583
--[BOTH] Stay out of it!
--[KOUSAKU gasps]

374
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,083
Okay, look, I'm only
trying to point out

375
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,916
that we're about to start the
whole rice-planting thing,

376
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,750
so it's probably best if
everyone lets bygones

377
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,416
be bygones.

378
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,375
[WAKA squeaks]

379
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,875
[BOTH] Ready when you are.

380
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,875
[KOUSAKU sighs]

381
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,666
[KOUSAKU] Alrighty, folks!

382
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,291
Let's get this show on the road
and start cultivating!

383
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,041
[gasps]

384
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,541
Pay no attention to that.

385
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,125
Only a little mud
between the toes.

386
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,291
You'll get used to it.

387
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,958
You might even find it
kind of pleasant.

388
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,291
Oh, okay.

389
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,750
First up: Let me show you
how to plant properly.

390
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,416
You're really good at this.

391
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,416
Huh? You... You think so?

392
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,166
Around here, Kousaku's the
man when it comes to rice.

393
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,166
His technique is legendary.

394
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,333
True fact: in class,

395
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,583
the teachers don't
hold a candle to him.

396
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,625
[KOUSAKU] Yeah. Back home,
they all used to call me

397
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,208
"the rice cultivating mad man."

398
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,458
No worries. It's not
as hard as it looks.

399
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,000
I call foul!

400
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,625
In case you haven't noticed,
we're trying to run a race here.

401
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,833
This is hardly the time
for one-on-one instruction!

402
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,666
Not so fast! Girl's got
a right to be taught.

403
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,625
I say let him.
We want a fair competition.

404
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,791
He can give her everything she
needs to know in a few minutes.

405
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,500
[MINORI] Fine then, teach her
your "legendary technique." But!

406
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,625
You'd better not be
stalling for time!

407
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,041
Yeah, yeah.

408
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,375
Let's see what you got.
Can you do it like I showed you?

409
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,541
Yes.

410
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,833
Not too shabby, but you got to
stick it down in the mud

411
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,416
a tiny bit deeper.

412
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,416
See, the way you've got it in
there now it'll get washed away.

413
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,125
So...?

414
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,583
Deeper.

415
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,041
Watch me.

416
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,458
You see how far I'm putting it
down in there? Bam.

417
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,375
We have to make sure the roots
are supported well. Yeah?

418
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,791
It's kind of hard to see.

419
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:14,916
Sure. Kind of.

420
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,250
Ugh! Come on already! Let's go!

421
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,375
Miss Becky could get a date
in half the time.

422
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,791
Just look at her!

423
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,833
Any longer and the poor woman
is going to shrivel up!

424
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,458
Take it from me: life is cruel.

425
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,000
Idea. Why don't you two
race as a team?

426
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,625
She leads, you come from behind.

427
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,666
Yeah, but for
that to work,

428
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,916
our bodies will have
to be touching--

429
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,333
Actually, what am I
complaining about?

430
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,833
This is a solid plan.
I'm excited to be a part of it.

431
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,000
Wait! I'm not liking this!
What is it teaching her?

432
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,500
Minori, give it a rest.

433
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,125
At the end of the day,
she's here to learn,

434
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,500
not worry about whether you
think she can pass the muster.

435
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,000
This is just too--!
Look at this thought bubble!

436
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,000
They're basically spooning, how
can I be comfortable with that?

437
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,625
Ringo. Are you okay
with touching?

438
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,208
--Sure.
--Seriously?!

439
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,625
This won't come back
to bite me in the ass?!

440
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:58,958
--Nope.
--Wait.

441
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,416
"Nope, not seriously" or
"nope" as in "we're" cool?

442
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,291
Bah! I'm in either way!

443
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,541
[squeals, chuckles]

444
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,541
'Kay, so...

445
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,458
Look out below,
mud's slippery! Timber!

446
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,791
Oh, I'm such a klutz!

447
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,750
Not as sure on my feet
as I thought I was.

448
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,666
Maybe I need some
one-on-one tutoring.

449
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,750
Do you charge, or what?

450
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,500
Uh, in case you
haven't noticed, Minori,

451
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,875
we're trying to run a race here.

452
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,333
Asshole.

453
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,541
All right. Since Miss Kinoshita
is the beginner,

454
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,083
we'll start her from there.

455
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,833
Miss Nakazawa, being the expert,
will start slightly behind.

456
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,791
The big moment
is almost upon us.

457
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,125
The tension in
the air is thick.

458
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,458
Welcome to the No-Rin
Rice Planting Cup.

459
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,625
Kousaku and myself
will be your hosts.

460
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,791
Thank you,
it's good to be here.

461
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,000
[KEI] We're waiting for
Miss Becky to do the honors.

462
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,458
[NATSUMI] Ready.

463
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,541
Go!!

464
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,708
[GUY 3B] Man, look at her go!

465
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,291
Nakazawa has
started strong.

466
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,833
But will that breakneck pace
take her to the finish line?

467
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,875
Bear in mind, Kei, the girl
has a reputation for stamina.

468
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,333
And it's clear she intends to
use it to bring the heat down

469
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,750
on her opponent.

470
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,625
[KEI] One has to question what
Kinoshita's plans are

471
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,958
once the two are neck and neck.

472
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,500
Come on!

473
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,791
Conserve your energy or you're
going to burn yourself out!

474
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,458
Yeah-yeah! Go, Ringo!

475
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,916
[GUY 3C] Slow and steady
wins the race!

476
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,500
[KEI] What the challenger
lacks in speed

477
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,541
she makes up for in
attention to detail.

478
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,666
You know, at the end of
the day, with a view like this

479
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,416
it doesn't even matter
who brings it home.

480
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,791
How does that work?

481
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,125
Give it a ponder, man!

482
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,625
For centuries men have
been in one of two camps:

483
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,208
You dig that ass, you're a perv.

484
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,750
Ta-tas and you're a mama's boy.

485
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,791
Brothers have been killing each
other over the difference

486
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,291
--since forever!
--He's right!

487
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,416
This competition is like
a peace treaty!

488
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,875
[GUYS] Whoa-ho!

489
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:55,833
[GUY 3D] Bloomers!

490
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:56,833
[GUY 3C] Swimsuit!

492
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,125
[GUY 3C] Ta-tas!

493
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,000
[GUY 3B] There's something
for everyone!

494
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,125
No longer must a man choose!

495
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,500
[GUYS sob]

496
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,583
Nakazawa is swiftly
closing the gap!

497
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,958
It's only a matter of moments
before she takes the lead!

498
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,958
Stop glaring. Just give up.

499
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,166
No way.

500
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,041
Look, deny all you want
but I'm telling you:

501
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,416
It's time you make peace
with the fact

502
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,208
you're not cut out
for this lifestyle.

503
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,458
Whatever you say.

504
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,291
Alright. That's it.
You're through!

505
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,166
[grunts]

506
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,833
Oops. Sorry.

507
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,458
Ha! Hey, no worries.
Accidents happen.

508
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,958
Occupational hazard
when you're a stupid slut!

509
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,541
[MINORI cackles]

510
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,958
[gasping]

511
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,958
Jackass.

512
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,875
Oh, that's it! I'm done
playing nice with you!

513
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,333
[grunts]

514
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,791
You stupid little hussy!
You're going down!

515
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,000
[RINGO] Quit being such a bitch.

516
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,291
[MINORI] I'll show
you bitch, bitch!

517
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,083
And it looks like they've
gone from rice planting

518
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,541
to mud wrestling!
We've got a spank fight!

519
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:13,333
I'd say so. I don't know
about you, Kei, but I'm riveted.

520
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,166
[KEI &amp; KOUSAKU] We should
probably stop them.

521
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,416
[KOUSAKU]
You've had your fun, ladies!

522
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,083
Stop trampling the rice field!

523
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,458
Damn but this is hot!

524
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,541
[grunting]

525
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,833
--[BOTH] Get away from me!
--[gasps]

526
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,875
[yelling]

527
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,583
[KEI &amp; KOUSAKU]
This was a bad idea!

528
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,833
[yelling]

529
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,416
[MINORI] That all you got,
jail bait?

530
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,750
[RINGO] Bring it, Bloomers!

531
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:33,333
[yelling, screaming]

532
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,125
Oh, boy.

533
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,083
You know, you're
actually pretty good.

534
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,750
Not as good as you.

535
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,208
[BOTH giggle]

536
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,583
[KOUSAKU] It's funny sometimes,
the things that'll make

537
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,750
two people want to
bury the hatchet.

538
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,708
That's life for you, I guess.

539
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,791
Oh, don't worry. I re-planted
the rice the next day.

540
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,000
Not with Miss Becky.

541
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,500
[KOUSAKU]
"The Smile You Showed Me."

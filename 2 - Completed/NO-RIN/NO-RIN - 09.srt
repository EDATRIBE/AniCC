00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,541
[MALE ANCHOR]
In other news, the heat is on

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,041
as the temperature soars
and the mercury rises,

3
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:15,375
though fun-seekers at Oarai
Beach will not be deterred.

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,916
[KOUSAKU] You know, when I was
kid, I couldn't say "Oarai."

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,375
So I used to think
it was pronounced

6
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,375
"Old Wall-Eye" Beach.

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,708
It did seem like a
weird name, though.

8
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,541
Huh. Your brain must
be a fascinating place.

9
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,000
Guys, it just dawned on me.

10
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,333
I haven't been to the beach
yet this summer.

11
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,958
[MINORI] Yeah.

12
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,458
I haven't been to the beach,
like, once in my entire life.

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,666
[ALL gasp]

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,083
Okay, that shouldn't
even be possible! Wow.

15
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,500
You-You're absolutely serious?

16
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,916
[MINORI] Mm-hmm...

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,166
I'm just going to come
right out and say that's sad.

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,166
Well, it's not like there's a
shoreline where we're from, so.

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,541
But don't they take you
on field trips?

20
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,833
Sure they do!

21
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,666
In grade school they
took us to Kyoto and Nara.

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,000
Then when we were older,

23
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,166
in middle school they
took us to Nara and Kyoto.

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,958
Sounds like the teachers
were really trying

25
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,583
to broaden your minds.

26
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,291
[RINGO] All right.

27
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,333
It's sand and surf time!

28
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,916
The schedule's flexible.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,125
I think we ought to be able to
squeeze in some fun in the sun.

30
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,916
Yeah! We got a break coming up.
Let's get our feet wet!

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,333
Woo-hoo!

32
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,250
Nice...

33
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,625
Ringo in beachwear...

34
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,125
Something fun...

35
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,166
Something skimpy...

36
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,333
That's a fabulous idea.
Where do I sign?

37
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,333
[KEI] Hell yeah!
We've worked hard!

38
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,791
And now we play hard!

39
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,208
[ALL] Yeah!

40
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,166
[KOUSAKU] But on the big day...

41
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,541
Unfortunately for those
planning a day at the beach,

42
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,958
this category one typhoon
lost none of its strength

43
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,625
before making landfall.

44
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:44,041
[KOUSAKU]
Mother Nature had other ideas.

45
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,458
[KEI] Flash flood warning, wind
advisory, lighting advisory,

46
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:24,500
rockslide advisory. Whoa-boy.
Trifecta plus one.

47
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,500
In poker, this would be
a straight flush.

48
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,125
Are we counting high-tide
and storm-surge warnings?

49
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,291
'Cause, uh, if so, we're going
to need another metaphor here.

50
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,875
This really sucks, guys.

51
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,958
Wow. A category one? On top of
all the rain we've been having

52
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,208
the past couple of weeks?

53
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,250
The weather this summer
has been out of control.

54
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,541
[MINORI] Beach! Beach!
Beach! Beach! Beach!

55
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,291
[MINORI shrieks]

56
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,458
Hah. And speaking of
out of control.

57
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,208
[MINORI]
The point is to get wet, right?!

58
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,208
So why are we letting
a measly little typhoon

59
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,250
rain on our parade?!
Damn it, I want to go to beach!

60
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,666
This isn't fair!

61
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,958
Minori! Please! Look, we all
want to go to the beach,

62
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,875
but we can't get there if
the buses aren't running.

63
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,958
There's nothing stopping us from
using our bicycles,

64
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,583
--is there? [sobs]
--I vote we tranquilize her!

65
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,500
Bikes won't do a whole
lot of good under water.

66
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,750
No one's going anywhere
in this, all right?

67
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,083
The beach will still be there

68
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,750
when our next break comes
around. We can go then.

69
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,291
I'll even buy you
an ice cream cone.

70
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,541
Is that a promise?!

71
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,083
If you calm down, yes.
Cross my heart, 'kay?

72
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,208
Okay! But we'll have to be
good and wait thirty minutes

73
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,541
before getting in the water!

74
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,000
Forces beyond all human
understanding are at work!

75
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,000
Ugh. Fantastic.
Just what we need.

76
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,458
[KEI] What happened to you?

77
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,416
They cancelled practical lab
on account of the weather.

78
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,208
I didn't get the notification
till I was halfway here.

79
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,833
And with all
the buses shut down,

80
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:39,291
let's just say I've had worse
days, but not all that many.

81
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,750
So, have they
cancelled everything?

82
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,083
Yep. And it looks
like I'm stuck here

83
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,833
till the weather decides to
stop being a pain in the ass.

84
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,541
Huh. Actually,
I guess we all are.

85
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,625
Yeah, well.
At least we're staying dry.

86
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,875
[RINGO] What kind of
practical lab was it?

87
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,791
Oh, just
cymbidium repositioning.

88
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,166
Cym... bi--what now?

89
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,791
Cym-bidium. It's an orchid.

90
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,125
One that prospers in the
southeast part of Asia.

91
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,458
Specifically in the crisp air
of the plateau.

92
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,125
We haul them up the
mountain each summer

93
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,833
to prevent their being
blasted by seasonal winds.

94
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,000
[KOUSAKU] The wind's
that rough on them, huh?

95
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,500
Indeed, and the plants
don't develop well

96
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,916
--when it's too hot.
--Perfect swan dive! Woo-hoo!

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,083
If they're stunted,
then they're worthless.

98
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,541
--[KOUSAKU] Wow. Didn't know
--Makin' a sandcastle!

99
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,583
--orchids were your thing.
--Sandcastle, sandcastle...

100
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,583
Didn't I mention
what they go for?

101
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,916
[KOUSAKU] Of course.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,583
Oh, historically, orchids
have been known to fetch

103
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,458
a king's ransom
on the open market.

104
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,166
Collectors the world over
go nuts for the little buggers.

105
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,416
So... Anyway,
before the storm hit

106
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,750
the plan was for us to haul a
batch of new cymbidiums

107
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,625
to market in the microbus.

108
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,625
Whoa. The microbus, huh?

109
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,166
You got to be brave
to ride in that thing.

110
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,375
[KANEGAMI] Truth is, with this
wind, I'm just as worried

111
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,041
about the greenhouse as I am
about the flowers themselves.

112
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,916
One good gust and
it's all she wrote.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,416
[KOUSAKU]
Hadn't thought of that.

114
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,791
Hey, uh... You think we should
close the storm shutters?

115
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,375
I mean, better safe
than sorry, right?

116
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,458
Yeah. Good idea.

117
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,250
Ah! Can you believe this?

118
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,125
Kind of Humbling, isn't it?

119
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,083
It's like...

120
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,500
I know.

121
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,833
[KOUSAKU] An ocean.

122
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:05,791
[KEI] Right?

123
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,666
[MINORI grunting]

124
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,833
Like an ocean.

125
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,416
[MINORI gasps] Ocean?!

126
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,875
Crap.

127
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,958
Stop her! Don't be
afraid to use force!

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,541
Minori! Get back
in here right now!

132
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,750
The glorious ocean
has come to us!

133
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,500
I feel like a mermaid!

134
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,541
[MINORI laughs]

135
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,250
It's not the ocean,
it's a flood!

136
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,125
[MINORI laughs]
This is beyond awesome!

137
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,500
Look at me! I'm swimming!

138
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,375
Earth to Minori! You'll drown!

139
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,125
The current's gonna
sweep you away!

140
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,666
[MINORI] This is so much fun!

141
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,333

142
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,125
[MINORI] So. Much. Fun!

143
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,125
Really?

144
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,208
[MINORI]
I've never felt so alive!

145
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,750
[KOUSAKU] This is ridiculous.
Get out of there, damn it!

146
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,208
This isn't--!

147
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,250
Yah-hoo!

148
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,333
--Splash!
--Oh, it is totally on now!

149
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,500
[MINORI laughs]
I ain't afraid of you!

150
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:18,458
[BOTH laugh]

151
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,791
Whoo!

152
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,416
No having fun
without me, guys!

153
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,500

156
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:45,291
[laughing continues]

157
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,916
Should I feel dirty
or is this normal?

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,208
Hey, it's just mud. There's
not a thing dirty about it.

159
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,750
[KOUSAKU] We're just two guys
enjoying the scenery.

160
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,750
[KEI] Key word: enjoying.

161
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,416
Someone find a
beach ball right now.

162
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,166
I want to do like they do
in the movies!

163
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,916
Volleyball!

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
[whistle blows]

165
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,958
[KOUSAKU] Service!

166
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,416
[KOUSAKU] Good game, everybody!

167
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,666
[ALL] Yay!

168
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,625
Okay, now we have to
split a watermelon!

169
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,416
Who's got one?

170
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,416
Somebody say watermelon?!

171
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,625
[MINORI] Huh?

172
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,458
Yeah! Watermelon!

173
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,791
[ALL] Woo!

174

00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,458
[KOUSAKU] With the stalks
already that long...

349
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,833
...they don't stand a chance.

350
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,833
This wind will knock 'em over
like bowling pins!

351
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,166
[RINGO] Oh no!

352
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,208
Why would you guys cultivate
something so risky?!

353
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,458
What was I supposed to do?!

354
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,583
This particular variety
sells like gang-busters!

355
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,958
You won't be selling
much of anything

356
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,250
when the whole field
goes tits up!

357
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,958
You two, quit your bickering!

358
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,291
Now is not the time
for that argument!

359
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,541
[KOUSAKU] You're right!

360
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,750
There are more
important things to focus on!

361
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,791
Captain Aramis must
save the day! Pronto!

362
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,208
Just... Just give me
a minute to think.

363
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,541
[KOUSAKU]
There's too many stalks for us

364
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,166
to move them out of harm's way.

365
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,333
The only thing to do
is block the wind.

366
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,875
Except... how, exactly?

367
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,791
Hey, our volleyball net
is super durable.

368
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,166
Why don't we use that?

369
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,708
[KOUSAKU] Last I checked,
a net is made of holes!

370
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,208
We need something
that'll make a wall.

371
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,333
Well, sandbagging would
be the best option,

372
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,208
except it's a
little late for that.

373
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,958
Thank you, Captain Obvious!

374
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,875
Ah! Ah-ha! Kanegami! The keys!

375
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:57,958
[KANEGAMI] Huh?

376
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,208
[KOUSAKU]
To the microbus! Give me!

377
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,833
You had it gassed up to move
the cymbidiums, didn't you?

378
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,791
[KANEGAMI] Ugh. Of course.

379
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,291
What are you
cooking up there, chief?

380
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,333
[KOUSAKU] Sorry!
No time to explain!

381
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,875
I'll be back, just start
roping off the field!

382
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,125
Ha! This is gonna work...

383
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,250
[RINGO] Kousaku!

384
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,083
Ringo! The field!

385
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,083
The others have it
covered, it's okay.

386
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,208
Fun Bags didn't like you
wandering off on your own

387
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,750
in the storm, so she
asked me to stay with you.

388
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, thanks. I'm a child.

389
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,750
Thank you, Fun Bags...

390
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,333
[RINGO] So what's
your big plan, exactly?

391
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,875
[KOUSAKU] We're gonna
improvise a wall.

392
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,291
[RINGO] O-kay...

393
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,291
It's simple: drive this upwind
and we block the gusts.

394
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,833
Stay with me here: Class D's
field is the furthest up, right?

395
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,791
Of its four sides,
three are flanked by roads.

396
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,750
If we drive the microbus
to the road up top,

397
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,500
it'll shield their
crop from the wind.

398
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,958
I had no idea you
even knew how to drive.

399
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,791
I don't, but it's a
standard diesel engine.

400
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,250
So, you know...

401
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,708
It can't be that
different from a tractor.

402
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,166
[engine sputters]

403
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,166
Okey-doke. First gear.

404
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,208
Release the emergency brake.

405
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,541
Rev the engine just enough
to get her nice and ready.

406
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,958
Ease up on the clutch
about halfway.

407
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,916
Release the clutch
once we get things a-moving.

408
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,250
[KOUSAKU]
And give her some juice.

409
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,250
Hell yeah!
Didn't even stall once!

410
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,416
That's incredible!

411
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,416
Nothing any farm boy
couldn't do, really.

412
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,125
Thing is...

413
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,875
Yeah?

414
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,541
[KOUSAKU] Driving without
adult supervision

415
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,125
is majorly against the rules.

416
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,791
Miss Becky's gonna be
out-of-her-mind furious.

417
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,708
Watch me get suspension.

418
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,250
You're not alone.

419
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,708
[KOUSAKU gasps]

420
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,500
[RINGO] If she gets upset,
it'll be at both of us.

421
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,166
Let's pull this mother out!

422
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,875
[KOUSAKU] Whoa! Aw, damn it!
I can't see the road!

423
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,333
Use the windshield wipers!

424
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,916
The, uh, what?

425
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,791
Those little things that go back
and forth on the windshield!

426
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,666
[RINGO]
It comes with those, right?

427
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,125
Hello?

428
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,041
Yeah, I don't know.

429
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,583
[RINGO gasps]

430
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,916
[KOUSAKU] Well tractors and
combines don't come with them,

431
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,583
how am I supposed
to know about buses?

432
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,458

433
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,708

What are you doing?!

434
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,875
Don't freak.

435
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,916
I'm going to act as
your lookout, okay?

436
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,166
I need you to follow my
directions to the letter!

437
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,916
Uh... Okay.

438
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,500
[RINGO] Keep going straight!

439
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,208
You got it!

440
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,208
Start veering to the right!
We're passing the gym!

441
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,666
[KOUSAKU] Veering right!

442
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,791
All right, now
straighten the wheel!

443
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,500
Easy does it, easy does it.

I give the word. Got it?

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,333

[KOCHOU] Oh, orange juice

459
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,500
Yeah. Here.

461
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,458
How about it, guys?

462
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,583
Is the marketing teacher
awesome-sauce or what?

463
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,708
Hell yeah you treat the people
who saved your rice crop

464
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,083
to a day at the beach!
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,166
[chuckles] Yep.

466
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,750
I'm finally going to
see the ocean

00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,625

You're a lucky man, dude.

Can't believe you got off
with a slap on the wrist.

No kidding, right?

472
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,166
If your little stunt
hadn't saved the field,

473
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,083
you'd both be suspended.

474
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,333
Whatever. Big whoop.
It was so totally worth it.

475
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,875
Hey. Kousaku.

00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,958

You, uh, might
wanna listen to this.

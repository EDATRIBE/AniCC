The way her eyebrows arch
as if to say, "Who, me?"

178
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,083
[KEI] Right. Thanks.

179
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,291
We get the picture.

180
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,708
[KOUSAKU] Oh-ho, no
you don't, my friend!

181

Not 'til you've heard me talk
about that one-of-kind,

[KOUSAKU yells]

184
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,875
Wrap it up, lover boy!
No one here gives a crap!

185
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,750
The survey's about
life after school.

186
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,625
Okay, fine.

187
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,875
What'd you put on yours, then?

188
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:49,958
[MINORI] Hmm?

189
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,416
[MINORI chuckles]

190
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,625
[KOUSAKU] College or job?

191
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,500
Uh! Ah! Um... Well, I guess
all things considered,

192
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,666
Let's say, "job."
Something in an office?

193
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,333
Hang on! Do-Don't read it!

194
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,333
[KEI] If any of those things
happen in an office,

195
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,291
you're doing them wrong.

196
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,625
This is dumb. Really dumb.

197
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,708
Don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot!

198
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,458
I'm thinking long term! Ugh!

199
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,291
Stop running your mouths.

200
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,166
Vulgarians!

201
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,125
[KOUSAKU &amp; MINORI]
It's Fun-bags McGee!

202
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,458
The name is Kochou!

203
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,625
Say it with me, now:
Kochou Yoshida!

204
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,083
Got it?!

205
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,666
The plebes in
Cultivation are a tragedy.

206
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,250
Small-minded
guttersnipes, that's you.

207
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,833
Production Science
is wasted on you.

208
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,333
Why they lump Cultivators

209
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,833
and Animal Husbandry students
together, I'll never know.

210
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,208
I'm charged with the care
of animate creatures.

211
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,125
You all just
roll around in the dirt.

212
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,083
A-hem.

213
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,291
The students across
the hall will thank you

214
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,916
to keep it down to a dull roar.

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,750
Your inane chatter
is distracting.

216
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,333
Oh, Like your big, smelly cow

217
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,833
isn't putting us
all off our game?

00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,250
Silence, Vulgarian tramp!

220
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,250
You know nothing!

221
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,791
Sit down and be schooled!

222
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,791
This magnificent beast, Agehagou
by name, is a Hidaushi,

223
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,791
the highest of the
elite wagyu rank!

224
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,875
Which makes no real difference
in her market value.

225
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,791
Actually, her fetching
price is expected

226
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,250
to be stratospheric, plebe.

227
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,833

228
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,458

[MINORI growls]

230
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,916
You can't just
switch sides on a dime.

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,333
That's not how this works!

232
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,000
[KOUSAKU] I pick the side
that doesn't murder me!

[KOUSAKU grunts]

234
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,583
[KOCHOU] Hmph. Violence
in lieu of dialogue.

235
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,250
I must say, you sum up
the Cultivators perfectly.

236
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,791
Yoshida.

as though we were equals?!

[KOCHOU whimpers]

240
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,083
We are worlds apart!

241
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,083
Cows are sort of on
the skittish side, right?

242
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,833
They don't do all that
great around people?

243
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,375
Not to tell you your job, but
do you think it's a smart idea

244
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,708
to bring one into
a classroom

245
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,708
full of loud,
obnoxious "vulgarians?"

246
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,083
Trying to hoist me
by my own petard, eh?

247
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,083
Well, your attempt at a touché
is as predictable as you!

248
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,708
Wow. Not cool.

249
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,583
Following this
morning's debacle,

250
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:09,041
I realized Agehagou's reaction
could create a teachable moment.

251
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,791
Call this an exercise
in moron endurance.

252
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,250
[KEI &amp; KOUSAKU]
Moron endurance?!

253
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,041
[KEI] That actually makes sense.

254
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,958
Nice. Well done, Yoshida.

255
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,541
That's some cutting edge
animal psychology technique.

256
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,916
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

Well, so long as we're
on the same page, I suppose.

259
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,625
So you understand why
it's inappropriate

260
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,208
to confer with me on even terms.

Points for calling me
"Miss," by the way.

273
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,708

she's not feeling her age.

good explanation. Yoshida?

[KOCHOU] Yes, ma'am.
You see, Mr. Mutsu

unfortunate accident.

I thought it best that I
care for her while he recovers.

That's a complete one-eighty
from what you said!

the task of babysitting a cow?

Oh, absolutely.

If she gets to bring a cow
into the classroom,

then the rest of us should be
able to bring our planters, too!

himself a man!

00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,541
Earth to Kousaku! Come in!

350
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,875
Damn it, what do you want?!

351
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,375
Can't you see
I'm deep in meditation?

352
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,958
You seriously need to
look at the television.

353
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,875
Yeah, it's a pretty big deal.

354
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,125
What?

355
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,583
Like anything's a
bigger deal than my Yuka--

00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,958
[REPORTER A] Excuse me!
Is it true you're retiring?

357
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,958
[KOUSAKU] God is dead!

[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

359
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,166
[KOUSAKU] It's not true!
I refuse to accept it!

360
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,750
No, no, no, no, no!

361
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,291
It's all a vicious lie!

[various animal cries]

363
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,708
[MINORI] Will you come out
of there already?

364
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,416
We're going to be
late for class.

365
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,458
[KEI] Life marches on, dude.

366
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,791
[MINORI sighs]

367
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,500
Fine. I shouldn't
have to do this, but...

368
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,166
Time to come out
and face reality!

369
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,333
Why do you have to be
such a pain?

370
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,500
Everybody gets--

00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,208

00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,583
[muffled crying]

373
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,250
[MINORI] What's wrong with you?!

374
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,166
[crying continues]

375
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,916
Can't believe people
actually buy those...

376
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,291
[MINORI sighs]

377
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,916
[MINORI] You're kidding me.

378
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,750
And here I'd been thinking you
were a semi-normal human being.

379
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,833
You do realize this means we
have no choice

380
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,166
but to take you out back
and put you down, right?

381
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,208
At least tell me you're
wearing a shirt under there.

382
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,500
[KOUSAKU yells]

383
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,666
[KOUSAKU] No, I am
not wearing a shirt!

384
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,166
Yukatan and I are of one flesh!

[KEI] Textbook PTSD.

386
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,750
He's like that guy who can't
wash the sheets

387
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,708
after his girlfriend puts the
kibosh on their relationship.

388
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,666
It might be too late for him.

389
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,666
Hey!

390
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,958
Stop being a freak
for two seconds

391
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,916
and come back to the real world!

392
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,791
If you don't come
to class, you'll fail.

393
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,375
Nobody wants that.

394
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,541
How else you going to
be a "trendy farmer?"

395
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,125
[KOUSAKU] What'd be the point?

396
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,458
[MINORI] Excuse me?

397
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,208
[KOUSAKU] I only ever grew stuff

398
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,500
so I could send fresh
vegetables to Yukatan.

Kibo 209 to Osaka...

00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,833
[KEI] Let me make sure
I get this:

403
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,458
You send it all to her?

Everything you've grown
in class since forever

405
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,541
goes to feed a well-off
Japanese pop star?

406
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,958
[KOUSAKU] Yup.

407
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,416
Eggplants in particular, though.
Big, bulging eggplants.

408
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,958
Pretty sure that's harassment.

409
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,000
Congratulations,
you're a stalker.

411
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,083
What are you talking about?!

412
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,500
If you were a girl, how would
you feel about

413
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,583
some complete and total
stranger shipping you a box

414
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,208
of produce shaped like that?

415
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,958
But... she lives in Tokyo! It's
a concrete jungle over there!

416
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,750
It's impossible
to find good veggies.

417
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,583
C'mon, who cares
what it's shaped like?

418
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,833
It's fresh!

420
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,250
Listen.

421
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,291
I know in your mind this is
all completely innocent.

422
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:35,041
Thanks. Knew you'd get it.
That's why you and me are bros.

423

have some daikon in there!

wrong with this, huh?

School me. Now.

00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,166
Explain to me exactly what
it is I'm doing wrong here.

Go on. I'm all ears.

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,041
Give me a break.

446
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,083
You need to be told
why it's creepy?

447
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,541
Apparently, yeah.

448
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,625
What about sending something
made with love to someone

449
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,625
who means the world to you
is such a huge crime?

450
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,375
Uh, you don't think
eggplants might've been

451
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,833
a little too suggestive?

452
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,041
Fine. Never mind the eggplants.

453
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,416
The real issue is you mailing
them anonymously

454
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,083
to someone you've
never even met.

455
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:35,750
Yeah.

00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,791
No. Nuh-uh.

00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,041
Don't skip over
the eggplant thing.

458
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,625
You're the one who
made it the hot button.

459
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,666
Put yourself in my shoes:

produce-I mean, come on,

you wouldn't
need an explanation?!

00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,750
No one's ragging on
your produce.

00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:50,500
It's just, eggplants
are... shaped funny...

464
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,125
[KOUSAKU] Oh, I see.
So eggplants are shaped funny.

465
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,458
Funny as in: dirty. Uh-huh.

466
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,333
Remind you of something, maybe?

467
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,750
Seems like a personal
problem if you ask me.

468
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,291
[MINORI] Hey. It's not--

469
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,416

make the rules, okay?

472
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,125
[KOUSAKU]
And what rules are those?

473
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,875
You'll have to
spell them out for me.

474
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,750
Describe for me what
the eggplant looks like

475
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,333
so I'll know for
future reference.

476
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:17,083
C'mon. It's clearly important--
What're they shaped like?

477
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,208
Huh?

478
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:23,125
Uh... They're-They're
shaped like a...

...pen...

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,083
Stop trying to make me
sound like a pervert!

481
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,208
Nice one.

482
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,000
You have to admit
you had that coming.

483
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,166
[KOUSAKU] Yeah. Guess it's
kind of hard to argue

484
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,375
with the logic of that
from this perspective.

485
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,583
[MINORI] Whatever.

486
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,666
She probably doesn't even open
the box you mail them in.

487
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,916
You ever gotten a
response from this girl?

488
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,833
[KOUSAKU] Never have,
never will...

489
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,333
[MINORI] Don't be so dramatic.

490
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,791
You're bound to get
something from her.

491
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:57,916
Eventually.

492
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,708
[KOUSAKU] I've stayed anonymous.

493
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,875
[MINORI] There is officially
no hope for you.

494
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,916
[KEI] Makes it that
much creepier.

495
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,208
It doesn't matter.

496
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,333
Just 'cause her career is over

497
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,916
doesn't mean you
get to skip class.

498
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,041
Here!

499
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,208
Get off your rump
and make an effort!

Pass! Life as I know it is over!

502
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,541
From now on if you want me...

503
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,833
You'll have to talk to
Yuka-tan!

504
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,333
Oh, she's so beautiful!
She's so sweet! So perfect!

507
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,583
Ugh. Fine.

508
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,625
The real one's probably
a total bitch anyway.

509
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,208
[KOUSAKU] Blasphemer!

510
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,250
Just because no man in his right
mind would give you his eggplant

511
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,333
doesn't mean you get to
foul-mouth my true love--

Goodbye, future offspring...

00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,000
[MINORI] I am not going
to say this again!

515
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,208
Stop being a titty baby
and grow a pair!

516
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,458
Our grades are on the line and
if you don't get it in gear,

517
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,958
I'll give the holier-than-thou's
in Animal Husbandry free reign

518
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,708
to mangle your
shriveled ball sack!

Now do we have an understanding,

00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,458
or do I need to drill you
a little more?

521
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,916
[KOUSAKU] Got it...

522
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,625
[KOUSAKU]
Why are we doing this?!

523
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,125
There's no point!

524
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,791
[MINORI] Stop bitching!
Nobody cares what you think.

525
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,708
Kei, make him
focus on his work!

526
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,583
[KEI] Huh? Right.

527
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,541
[NATSUMI] So last night
was a complete wash!

528
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,791
Literally!

529
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,750
I bought this fabulously
expensive essential oil

530
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,083
I read about online
everyone says

531
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,708
makes you look
ten years younger.

532
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,708
Talk about incredible!

533
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,958
Oh, my skin was so soft,

534
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,541
you'd think I just
popped out of the womb!

535
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,916
Then I thought, "why
spend so much," right?

536
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,833
What's so 'essential'
about essential oils

537
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,458
that any old oil won't do?

538
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,541
So, it's into the kitchen for a
bottle extra virgin olive oil

539
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,083
with a sprinkle of chili powder,

540
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,208
'cause, you know, in for a
penny, in for a pound.

541
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,083
And let met tell you boys
and girls, it made me slick.

542
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,125
As in, like a fish. A fish!

543
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,375
So out comes the smart phone,

544
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,875
'cause we all know I'm
a bit of an over-sharer.

545
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,375
Selfie after selfie
posted on the web.

546
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,750
Good times!

547
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,916
Kind of pathetic actually.

548
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,583
A grown woman dousing herself in
olive oil to try

549
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,750
and grab a little attention
from the opposite sex.

550
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,541
That, class, is what
adults call "desperation."

551
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,916
You might think you understand
the meaning of the word,

552
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,791
trust me, you don't.

553
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,083
Oh. Right.

554
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,625
You have a new classmate.

555
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,166
It's not a cow, is it?

556
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,458
No. In fact, she's anything but.

557
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,291
Hey. Miss Kinoshita. Come on in!

558
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,208
[KOUSAKU] No way this girl's
an ordinary high school student.

559
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,041
She's too pretty.
I mean, look at her.

560
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,458
She makes that uniform look like
something out of a magazine.

561
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,291
She looks like a pop star.

562
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,708
She looks like...

563
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,666
My Yukatan.

564
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,500
My name's Ringo Kinoshita.

565
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:11,958
[KOUSAKU] Eh?

566
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,500
[KOUSAKU] "The King of Farmers."

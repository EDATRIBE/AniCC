00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,291
[roosters caw]

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,750
[mooing]

3
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,583
[KEI] Time for the next phase
of your farm education.

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,875
Your time in the
rice paddy was instructive,

5
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:17,875
but I think you're
ready for more.

6
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,750
Lesson number two
is... going in dry!

7
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,500
[MINORI] There are tons of crops
that grow in those conditions.

8
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,458
What're we gonna
start her on?

9
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,791
[KEI] Hmph.

10
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:27,666
The soybean.

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,083
[KOUSAKU &amp; MINORI] Outta sight!

12
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,083
[KEI] I chose them, not only
because as novice farmers go,

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,666
they're a pretty forgiving crop,

14
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,041
but because the end-product
is such a Jack of all trades.

15
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,375
Miso, soy sauce, tofu,
natto, cooked beans,

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,291
soymilk and soy flour.

17
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,958
They can also be made
into bean sprouts or edamame.

18
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,625
Edamame is soybean, then?

19
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:49,666
You betcha!

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,000
The humble soybean.

21
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,166
So packed with nutrients
and carbohydrates.

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,875
some call it "the meat
of the field".

23
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,083
People eat it all the
time, it's fairly common,

24
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,791
but that's just one use
for this awesome legume.

25
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:04,041
In a bean-ocracy,
they would be king!

26
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,041
When will it sprout up?

27
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,833
Soybeans grow pretty quickly.

28
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:18,916
Tonight, then?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,750
Wow. You are so from the city.

30
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,625
[KEI] Ten days' to two weeks'
time, give or take.

31
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:29,833
All right!

32
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,708
Show them who's boss, Ringo!

33
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,500
As Ringo pushed those handy
little soybeans into the soil,

34
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,958
we had no idea that one
of their products, miso,

35
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,750
would soon be leading me
down the shirtless path

36
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,375
of yogurty hell!

37
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,625
[MINORI] Aww! Guys,
we're out of miso!

38
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,375
Who feels like going
on a supply run?

39
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,125
But doesn't that mean
going up to Biotech?

40
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:21,750
[MINORI] Yeah.

41
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,375
What's a Biotech?

42
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,708
Oh. It's another class, like us.

43
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,250
Its full name's the
Biotechnology Department.

44
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,041
We also call them Class B,
which works out pretty well.

45
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,916
[KEI] Miso is important, but...

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,541
Biotech...

47
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,375
I'm not a big fan of
their class rep, to be honest.

48
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,375
Why's that?

49
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,125
He's totally weird.

50
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,541
He's so standoff-ish
most of the time.

51
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,458
And then he's staring
at you all funny-like.

52
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,083
Does he want to talk?

53
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,291
You look at him to
engage him in conversation

54
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,166
but he runs away for safety.

55
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,708
Then stares some more.

56
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,416
Awkward...

57
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,833
Mm-hmm!

58
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,250
Fine then, don't talk to him.
But if nobody mans up,

59
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,083
there won't be any
miso soup at dinner.

60
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,958
[KOUSAKU] I want soup, but...

61
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,958
[KEI] Kousaku. We can do this.

62
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,166
[KOUSAKU] Yeah. Okay.

63
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:04,875
[KEI] You ready?

64
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:05,625
[KOUSAKU] Yeah.

65
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,791
Miso!

66
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,250
Hell yeah!

67
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,500
[KOUSAKU] Little did we know...

68
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,000
[KOUSAKU] Up here, right?

69
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:15,916
[KEI] So they say.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,041
You don't know, then?

71
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,375
[gasps, screams]

72
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,416
Ringo?! What the heck?!

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,625
I just wanted to know
where the room was.

74
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,958
Oh, right.

75
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,791
I forgot you've never
been up to Class B before.

76
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,208
We're kind of in the
same the boat--

77
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,125
We've never actually
gone inside.

78
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,875
[RINGO] Look at this stuff.
What do they do with it?

79
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:39,416
[KEI] Production's curriculum
is very different than ours.

80
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,541
[KOUSAKU] So they use
all these machines?

81
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,000
It's like a lab in here!

82
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,208
[GIRL] Such is the power
of science!

83
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,083
[ALL gasp]

84
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,208
[KOUSAKU] You...

85
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,833
You're Akari Suzuki,
a.k.a. Bio Suzuki!

86
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:56,083
In the flesh. Minori said you
might be paying me a visit.

87
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,375
Here at Tamo No-Rin,
the weirdest and strongest of us

88
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,291
are known as Farming's Top Four!

89
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,458
I never expected one of those
numbered students to be here!

90
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,791
Now, now.

91
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,250
Protocol dictates that
I receive the Class A rep,

92
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,166
his bosom friend,
and the rather much-discussed

93
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,250
transfer student with open arms.

94
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:18,708
If you want some miso,
take your fill, Class A!

95
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,791
[RINGO] Smells yummy.

96
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,416
As well it should.

97
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,666
Only soybeans that had
gone through a thorough

98
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,625
vetting process made it in.

99
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,791
Is that so?

100
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,791
[AKARI]
Put some onto a cucumber.

101
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,625
It makes for a wonderful snack
this time of year!

102
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:33,666
Hurry it up.

103
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,833
Will do.

104
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,208
I guess you're hungry, huh?

105
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,791
[KEI] Thanks for
this beany boon.

106
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,416
Not just yet.

107
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,250
Before you go, would you
be kind enough to help me

108
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,875
with a trifling matter?

109
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,750
"Trifling matter?"

110
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,541
What's up?

111
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,916
I require... some test subjects!

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,083
[KOUSAKU &amp; KEI] I don't want to!

113
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,791
[giggles]

114
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,083
[AKARI] Easy, boys...

115
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,458
We developed a
new product in Class B.

116
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,750
I merely need some help
with a trial run.

117
00:05:58,833 --> 00:05:59,791
Really?

118
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,416
What exactly did you make?

119
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,000
A Lactobacillus!

120
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,125
[KEI &amp; KOUSAKU] Lactobacillus?

121
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,875
Y'mean like that junk in yogurt?

122
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,125
Very good.

123
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,208
It makes lactic acid,
and this latest batch,

124
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,083
complements of the
Biotech Department,

125
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,708
is of the vegetable variety.

126
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,791
Yeah, as if!

127
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,916
Yogurt is made of milk.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,125
I didn't just fall off
of the turnip truck!

129
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,375
[giggles]

130
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,666
My poor boy, you must
have metal in your head.

131
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,416
Lactobacilli are in
rice bran pickles.

132
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,208
That miso you're holding.

133
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,166
You even find them floating
in the air we breathe.

134
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,833
We call ours--!

135
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,583
[BOTH] Dun dun dun!

136
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,875
Anal BB! You like that?!

137
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,666
For "All Natural Life
Science, Bio Type B".

138
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,750
It's the perfect acronym!

139
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,541
[KOUSAKU] Ho-boy.

140
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,625
With a name like that,

141
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,916
I thought it was some
kind of ointment

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,708
[KEI] Apply directly
to the anus.

143
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,875
Geez! Did you really
have to blurt it out?!

144
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,666
[KEI] I'm going
to regret asking,

145
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,375
but exactly what sort of trial
run did you have in mind?

146
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,500
[AKARI] Just testing the product
in real-world conditions.

147
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,583
Specifically, this yogurt
made from Anal BB.

148
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,791
A taste-test, huh?

149
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,500
Why didn't you say so earlier?

150
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,375
[AKARI] While I applaud your
willingness to lend me a hand.

151
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,750
This isn't the
kind of yogurt you eat.

152
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:08,583
Huh?!

153
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,791
[AKARI] No. It's the kind...

154
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,083
...you apply topically!

155
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,750
[BOTH] It's topical yogurt?

156
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,750
[RINGO] It's not for eating?

157
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,000
[AKARI] It's a fact.

158
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,666
Lactobacillus on crops
reduces vermin attacks.

159
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,166
Not to mention
the added promotion

160
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,083
of healthy germination.
This is common knowledge!

161
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,916
Even if the proof is anecdotal!

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,416
With that in mind, I thought
Anal BB might help

163
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,291
other things grow, too!

164
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,750
Well, she did hook us
up with the miso.

165
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,041
We're in her debt.

166
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,416
So what do you think?
Want to give it a shot?

167
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,750
[KEI] I'm game.

168
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,583
[KOUSAKU] Bad call, self.

169
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,250
So, uh, where are our shirts?

170
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,125
[AKARI] What, and get
Anal BB all over them?

171
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,166
I think not!

172
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,833
It's time for yogurt bukkake!

173
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,333
[AKARI] No need to
get involved, Kinoshita.

174
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,000
Your face is plenty
smooth without them

175
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,666
shooting all over it.

176
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,250
[KEI] You down for Anal BB?

177
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,291
[KOUSAKU] Yeah. Whatever
you're packing, give me.

178
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,708
Ugh!

179
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,333
Fill me in. What's up
with the camera?

180
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,583
Yeah, what's that about?

181
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,041
[AKARI] You troglodyte!

182
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,958
The answer to your question
is patently obvious!

183
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,958
I owe it to science
to document my results!

184
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,833
Now, less talkin'
and more bukkak-in'!

185
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,958
Dude. Really?

186
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,375
Ah--!

187
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,583
Candid shots!

188
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,458
[STUDENTS] Skeet!

189
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,666
Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet,
skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet!

190
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,166
You fool! Why'd you aim
for the chest?

191
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,375
Hit him in the
glasses next time!

192
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,958
If you know
what's good for you,

193
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,833
you'll shoot your wad
on his lenses!

194
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:42,916
Fix his make-up!

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,625
[STUDENTS] Skeet!

196
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,625
Kei, this is a food
experiment, isn't it?

197
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,458
Please tell me we're not
in a yogurt porn.

198
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,500
[KEI] Perhaps it's a
little bit of both.

199
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,041
I'm ready for my
close-up, Miss Suzuki!

200
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,083
Quiet on the set, men!

201
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,750
You, you, Splotch-a-Bro,
scene two, action!

202
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,541
Aw, come on!

203
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,958
Don't sacrifice my dignity for a
film with a ripped-off title!

204
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,000
She swiped Hakusho!

205
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,833
Now I will show you
my power at 80 percent!

206
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,916
Dude, not the time
to quote it!

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,375
Uwegh!

208
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,875
What the hell?
You're shipping us!

209
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,125
His bro-gurt is your destiny!

210
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,625
[KOUSAKU] Hmm... That line.
Put it in the fan-fic.

211
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,208
You idiot!

212
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,416
I don't want to be a
Mary-Sue in my own slash!

213
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,750
What does all that
even mean?!

214
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,291
Huh?!

215
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,250
--Kei! Where're your pants?
--Bro-gurt... Bro-gurt...

216
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,791
--You-You don't want to do this!
--Bro-gurt... Bro-gurt...

217
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,916
--No, please!
--Bro-gurt! Bro-gurt!

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,291
[KOUSAKU screams]

219
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,333
Glad you got it off!

220
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,375
These dailies are solid.

221
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,291
As a sign of thanks,
I'll give you a "tip."

222
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,416
Say "hint", not "tip".

223
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,000
Even now as we speak,
F is on the move.

224
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,083
So watch yourself.

225
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,583
[gasps]

226
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,375
Dear God! F?!

227
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,000
[KOUSAKU] Go-go-go-go-go,
got to go, got to go fast!

228
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,958
[WAKA squeaks]

229
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,875
[MINORI] Kousaku!

230
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:21,916
What're you doing out here?

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,333
No! Go back!
It isn't safe out here!

232
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,791
But waiting got boring.

233
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,083
[KOUSAKU] So you
threw your lives away

234
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,166
because you got a little antsy?!

235
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,791
[MINORI] What's got you
all freaked out?

236
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,375
[KOUSAKU sighs]

237
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,250
Legend tells of a class
of great brutality.

238
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,750
[KEI] Brute strength is the only
law they choose to recognize!

239
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,333
Sowing terror among their
foes for a century now,

240
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,458
these dervishes of doom
formed the backbone

241
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,458
of our very school!

242
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,333
Their class is the letter...

243
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,041
[BOTH] F!

244
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,708
[crows cawwing]

245
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,833
F, huh?

246
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,708
Yes! And the F stands for--!

247
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,125
[BOY A] --fooling with the
Woodmen is a fatal flaw,

248
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,416
friend-o!

249
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,875
[KOUSAKU] Hey...
I know you!

250
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,458
You're one of
Farming's Top Four,

251
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,541
Class F rep
Rintarou "Woodman" Miyoumoto!

252
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,041
Shut up, sapling!

253
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,750
I'm going to take you up
to the House of Pain.

254
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,208
The Treehouse of Pain, that is.

255
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,208
How come, huh?
What'd I do wrong?

256
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,125
Sure, play dumb.

257
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,875
You and I both know.

258
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,708
You talk to women so easy
just to spite us!

259
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,125
[yelling]

260
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,500
The F in Class F
is for "forest".

261
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,166
Of all the various departments,

262
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,416
Forest Engineering has the
single harshest curriculum.

263
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,583
None of us graduate
without first surviving

264
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,250
rigorous mortal combat.

265
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,666
We live up here
six months outta twelve.

266
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,333
We're men!
With wood in our hearts!

267
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,791
An' we're going to
show you our wood!

268
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,708
[MINORI] This guy has no idea
what he just said, does he?

269
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,625
Guys like you don't do anything
but mess around in the dirt

270
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,791
with seeds and junk,
and you have two actual,

271
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,333
real-live girls
following you around?!

272
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,708
That's balls!

273
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,666
[KOUSAKU] Didn't a girl join
your class this year?

274
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,333
She left the next day!

275
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,791
You Class A twerps bogart
the knockout transfer student,

276
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,458
and that's bad enough, but
watching you treat Nakazawa

277
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,208
like chopped liver hits us
like a handsaw in the heart!

278
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,083
That's old-growth devotion, man!

279
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,166
Wait. Do you like her?

280
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:17,666
She's nice!

281
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,583
Cheerful!

282
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,166
Boobies!

283
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:19,791
Childhood friend!

284
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,375
Good cook!

285
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,541
[RINTAROU] She's got everything
we Woodmen look for in a woman!

286
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,708
So why are you sprung
for the new girl?!

287
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,291
[KOUSAKU] Huh?

288
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,708
Yeah! I think the tree-dude's
making some good points there!

289
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,750
[squeals]

290
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,875
Listen up, Kousaku.
And listen good.

291
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,083
Cause I'm only
going to say this once.

292
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:41,750
Is it true that you and Nakazawa
here used to take baths together

293
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,000
'til you were in
the ninth grade?

294
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,416
Huh?!

295
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,291
No, of course not!
That's crazy-talk, man!

296
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,125
Yeah, I should've
known better!

297
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,583
No guy is that kind of lucky!

298
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,583
It was only up until
the eighth grade!

299
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,708
You son-of-a-bitch!

300
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,083
[FOREST GUYS yelling]

301
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,291
[KOUSAKU] Wait! It's not
what you're thinking, okay?

302
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,666
[WAKA squeals]

303
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,333
I haven't had a mom
for years and years now,

304
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,583
and my dad works away
from home in the winter.

305
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,958
Get to the bath part!

306
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,208
Dad sent me to live at
Minori's house for a while.

307
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,750
[RINTAROU] Get to the bath part!

308
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,750
There were too many
kids to bathe alone

309
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,166
so my baths were
with all four sisters.

310
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,583
[RINTAROU] You're telling me...
You had four girls in the bath?!

311
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,375
At once?

312
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,708
Yup.

313
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,833
[RINTAROU] All right.
You're dead!

314
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,375
I don't want to die
just 'cause I kept up

315
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,875
with my personal hygene!

316
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,833
You didn't miss out
on anything, trust me!

317
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,458
There were no branches on this
trunk, if you catch my drift!

318
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,000
No branches, huh?!
What the hell's wrong with you?

319
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,666
Well it was the truth,
wasn't it?!

320
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,250
Maybe then!

321
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,250
But maybe you should check out
these redwoods I'm packing now!

322
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,708
If you want to keep
the tree simile afloat

323
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,166
they're more like bonsais.

324
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,458
Ah! Why're you being
such a bastard?!

325
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,750
You know what?!

326
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,458
My bonsais and I are
dragging you into the bath

327
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,291
for a rematch later today!
If I'm really such a zero,

328
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,375
it shouldn't be a
problem for you, right?!

329
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,416
Yeah, fine. I guess.

330
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,750
Not that I care either way--

331
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,958
That a boy!

332
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,541
I'm going to give your back
a good scrubbing

333
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,000
the way I always used to!

334
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:57,750
Nah, I'm good!

335
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,958
No you're not!

336
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,500
There're some places
we just can't get to.

337
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,166
You could wash my back, too.

338
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,625
It's only fair,
you big butthead.

339
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,375
After that, we could take a
crack at each other's fronts!

[FOREST GUYS scream]

341
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,791

[RINGO] Huh. Eighth grade.

344
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,333
That story, is it true?

345
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,000
You were just joking, right?

346
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,791
[FOREST GUY 5D] Riny!

347
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,583
He looks tore up.
What the heck?

348
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,291
It's because love-triangles
are like poison to him!

349
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,875
[RINTAROU] Want to know
something, Kousaku?

350
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,833
[KOUSAKU] Yeah. I guess.

351
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,416
[RINTAROU] I.... I never got
to sit next to a girl in class

352
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,000
not having girls
or desks out here.

353
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,958
And I never will.

354
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,166
Not unless I take the bull
by the horns, right?

355
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,791
Problems are like trees.

356
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,125
Unless I start chopping away
at them, they won't go down.

357
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,666
[RINTAROU] That's it, then.
My mind's made up.

358
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,083
I'm going to give the Forest
Engineering Department

359
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,750
such a spit-shine, the ladies
will be signing up in droves.

360
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,916
Yeah? How you figure?

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,916
We'll court them.

362
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,625
Court who?

363
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:17,416
Forest Girls!

364
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,916
[FOREST GUYS] The F in
Class F is for Forest!

365
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,625
Yes, I speak of
that fashion trend

366
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,333
that's taking the
ladies by storm!

367
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,333
We'll be their
lumberjacks of love!

368
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,583
[FOREST GUYS cheer]

369
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,583
[MINORI] What? That idea
came and went, you guys.

370
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,625
[KEI] She's right.
They've moved on.

371
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,708
[KOUSAKU] You'll need
a time machine.

372
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,041
[FOREST GUYS] Shut up!

373
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,333
Can't you see how badly
we need women up in here?!

374
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,875
If only we could sit next to one
and then forget our textbook,

375
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,291
so we'd have to share?

376
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,083
Or both of us go to pick up a
dropped pencil at once

377
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,500
and our fingers touch?

378
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:50,208
And the group projects!
Think of the group projects!

379
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,250
The F in Class F is for Female!

380
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,416
It's like they were
raised on dating sims.

381
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,083
You know, they might actually
find the right ones yet.

382
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,958
While it's true that
the Forest Girl fad

383
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,833
didn't have quite so much
in the way of staying power,

384
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,833
there's a new breed of athletic,
outdoorsy women

385
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,875
who might just be what
you guys are looking for.

386
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,000
[FOREST GUYS gasp]

387
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,333
You mean it?
Take a knee, fellas!

388
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,625
I'm talking about.
Mountain Girls!

389
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,750
[FOREST GUYS] Mountain Girls!

390
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,833
They go hiking on
rock-strewn trails.

391
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,791
And some of them
even mountain-climb.

392
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,583
This growing trend could bring
them right to your doorstep!

393
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,666
[FOREST GUYS] The F
in Class F is for Mt. Fuji!

394
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,000
Back to the summit!
To await our womens!

395
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,708
[RINTAROU laughs]

396
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,041
[FOREST GUYS cheer]

397
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,416
I hope they're cool
with a hell of a wait.

398
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,875
[WAKA squeaks]

399
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,708
[GUY] It seems
Rintarou has lost.

400
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:44,416
[WOMAN] Of Farming's Top
Four, he is the weakest.

401
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,750
[AKARI] He's a disgrace
to our good name,

402
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,041
defeated by a mere
lack of women.

403
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,875
[AKARI giggles]

404
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:10,000
[GUY] It's time for a snack,
my tender morsel.

405
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:17,083
[KOUSAKU] Huh? Maybe she's just
running late or something.

406
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,333
Hmm... She said
she'd be here, though.

407
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,041
Wonder what's up?

408
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,666
[KOUSAKU] Well,
if she's not out here,

409
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,458
I don't know
where to look.

410
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,500
No! Her book!

411
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,291
[GUY] You're seventeen?
Serendipitous.

412
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:41,208
As years go, that one is
molto bellissimo.

413
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,916
[RINGO] Aren't you the same age?

414
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,833
[GUY] I am seventeen
at every age.

415
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,500
Numbers of its ilk
are known as prime.

416
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,875
They're lonely
in their indivisibility.

417
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,291
A loneliness I know
only too well.

418
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,666
[KOUSAKU] That's enough!

419
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,166
I knew that it was you,
Class E rep, Rose Hanazono!

420
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,666
Why, yes, I am!

421
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,041
[KOUSAKU growls]
I've got your number!

422
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,000
You're a student in the
Landscaping Department,

423
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,791
and you're one of
Farming's Top Four,

424
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,750
not to mention the fact you're
the hottest guy in school!

425
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,666
None of that gives you
the right to kidnap Ringo!

426
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,708
For that, your life is forfeit!

427
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,750
[RINGO slurps] Hey, Kousaku.

428
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,458
Please tell me your
virtue is still intact!

429
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,708
Why'd you no-show
at the library, huh?

430
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,708
[RINGO] He offered me
snacks, so...

431
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,208
[KOUSAKU] How the heck have you
even survived this long?!

432
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,500
And you! Did I or did I not
tell you to never ever

433
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,500
mess around with
Class A girls again?!

434
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,291
Oh yeah? So what
did he do before?

435
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,625
He tried putting the moves
on Minori about a year ago.

436
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,625
[KAORU laughs]
You still recall that?

437
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,958
Her too, I'll wager.

438
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,583
[KOUSAKU] Know what
happens when a hot guy

439
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,208
hits on a girl like Minori?!

440
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,083
She loses her damn mind,
that's what!

441
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,250
You're all she wanted to talk
about for the next three weeks!

442
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,000
[KAORU] I get what I want, my
dear boy, no matter the cost.

443
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,416
It's a good policy to have...

444
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,791
Eh?

445
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,583
You don't get to add her
to the list 'cause she's...

446
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,041
not for sale!

447
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,666
[WAKA squeaks]

448
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,041
[KAORU laughs]
That's just lip-service.

449
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,083
Like hell!

450
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,375
The Pockin knows your measure.

451
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,791
Face me in crunchy combat!

452
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,750
Where did you... get that?

453
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,041
The rules are few. We start
chewing at it from either side.

454
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,833
Whoever breaks it apart or
flinches first is the loser.

455
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,750
Have at you, churl!

456
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,041
Trial by Pockin! With Ringo
as prize to the victor!

457
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,375
Bring it on!

458
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,541
Don't fret, Ringo!
I've got this one in the bag!

459
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,333
[KOUSAKU] He's really going
on the offensive, huh?!

460
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,208
[KOUSAKU] What?!

461
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,916
Hanazono closed his eyes!
He's not backing off at all!

462
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,750
He just keeps nibbling!

463
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,375
My heart is pounding!

464
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,375
The heat from his face
is burning me up!

465
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,083
[KAORU chuckles]

466
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,708
Stop this game! It's a trap!

467
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:15,916
[sighs]

468
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,083
And not a single
moment to spare.

469
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,416
Kousaku, I need you to step away
from that man on the double!

470
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,416
Rose Hanazono is class rep of
the Landscaping Department,

471
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,166
but the landscape that
interests him most

472
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,833
is right in front of him!

473
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,125
[KEI] I was too late!

474
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,791
Get your mouth off of him!

475
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,500
That right there
is the money shot!

476
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,000
I have tasted the rainbow!

477
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,458
[KAORU] Your first kiss
wasn't Ringo! It was me, 'Zono!

478
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:02,083
You have a lot of
nerve, don't you!

479
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,083
Indeed.

480
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,000
How long I've waited
for this moment.

481
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,625
It was di molto bellissima!

482
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,375
Then... you couldn't care
less about Minori or Ringo!

483
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,791
Go on!

484
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,625
[KOUSAKU] You used them to
get to me 'cause you're--!

485
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,333
[KAORU] Yes! I am!

486
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,208
Well I am not, so slow
your roll, hot-lips!

487
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,375
And you guys just sat back
and let this happen?

488
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,958
You betcha!

489
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,833
Your uke hi-jinks will play out
fantastically in my doujinshi!

490
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,375
How come I got to
be the uke?!

491
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,916
There's a big gay world
waiting for you!

492
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,250
I'm fine right here!

493
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,375
It's all because he
bathed with me!

494
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,625
Your boobs are great, okay?!

495
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,416
Hey.

496
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,666
You need something, Ringo?

497
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,083
[RINGO] One, Bio Suzuki.

498
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,458
Two, Woodman Rintarou.

499
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,000
Three, Rose Hanazono.

500
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,791
[KOUSAKU] Mm... So?

501
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,000
[RINGO] Aren't there four?

502
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,583
[gasping]

503
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,041
[WAKA squeaks]

504
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,208
[mysterious laughter]

505
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,583
[KOUSAKU] Next time on No-Rin,

506
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,125
the last member of Farming's
Top Four will arrive!

507
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,916
Probably could've done all this
in one episode, but whatever!

508
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,791
[KOUSAKU]
Full-Moe Alchemist: Bounty.

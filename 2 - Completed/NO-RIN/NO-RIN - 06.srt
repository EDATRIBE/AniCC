1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,583
[ALEGGSIS] Moe Eggs!

2
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:13,291
Farm fresh, unfertilized
and unbelievably smooth!

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,750
Cooked or raw.

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,000
Yum! So very tasty!

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,916
[ALEGGSIS] Where else can you
get eggs likes this

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,333
but--you guessed it--Tamo
No-Rin High School?

7
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,083
Our eggs use condoms,
so you know they're safe!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,708
[KOUSAKU] Sure, that last part
was bit much,

9
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,625
but, hey, we had an idea
and we ran with it.

10
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,000
None of us knew it would be
the proverbial golden goose.

11
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,125
[MINORI] Moe rice.

12
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,708
Any clue what
I'm talking about?

13
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,250
[KOUSAKU] Yeah, no.

14
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,500
Oh-ho! You've got to see it!
They've been all over the news!

15
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,041
Very simple concept.

16
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,125
Rice with a hot naked lady
on the packaging sells like wow!

17
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,708
Step one: Produce.
Step two: Sex.

18
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,083
Step three: Cash.

19
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,750
[KEI] It's actually real.

20
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,041
Wow. Really?

21
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,833
They hired a manga artist.

22
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,833
I forget his name, but he's real
popular with the otaku crowd.

23
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,375
He drew a bishojo chick in
a tantalizing pose and boom.

24
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,625
Thirty-two tons of rice sold
online in ninety days.

25
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,000
The company normally unloads
about fifteen tons a year,

26
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,708
so the new mascot
earned them eight times

27
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,958
their average monthly sales.

28
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,375
Whoa! Damn!

29
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,958
[MINORI]
Imagine how much we can sell

30
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,541
if we took the same approach?!

31
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,791
A little tasteful nudity and the
school would be rolling in it!

32
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,875
[laughter]

33
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,625
I smell profit.
Ah, hello my lovelies.

34
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,666
Heads up! We've got a Top Four!

35
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,458
Whenever two or more
people talk finance,

36
00:02:56,541 --> 00:03:00,166
this one's ready to pounce!
Hide your 401k's!

37
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,708
[RINGO] Hmm...
So, she's a Top Four?

38
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:06,250
Correct! The school
has four of these types in all.

39
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,916
One: Fun Bags Yoshida
from Class A.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,333
Two: Bio Suzuki from Class B.

41
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,208
Three: Woodman
Rintarou from Class F.

42
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,416
Rose Hanazono
from Class E.

43
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,750
And last but not least,
from Class D,

44
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,166
agronomic specialist and
marketing-slash-logistics guru,

45
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,708
Money Kanegami!

46
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,208
[RINGO] Hmm...
You just named five.

47
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,916
Never mind about that!

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,416
[KANEGAMI] So...
Rolling in it, huh?

49
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,958
[sighs] Something we
can help you with?

50
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,500
[laughs] All we've been
through together

51
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,166
and that's how
you say hello?

52
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
Thought I counted
for more than that.

53
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,666
Didn't your recent
hedge fund shenanigans

54
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,166
get you indefinitely suspended?

55
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,583
Oh, they let me back
in as of yesterday.

56
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,833
But let's cut to the chase.
You're cooking something up.

57
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,375
Mama wants in.

58
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,666
Good for you.

59
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,416
The Moe racket's
a cash cow.

60
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,041
I've been wanting to dip my wick
into that honey pot for ages.

61
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,916
Yeah, well, easier
said than done.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,625
it's not exactly
low-hanging fruit.

63
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,958
He's right, you know.

64
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,666
We'd need a big name
artist onboard.

65
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,916
Anybody can slap a pic of
some spread-eagle bimbo

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,166
on the front of a rice bag
and use it to boost sales.

67
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,583
[laughs] You want a big-name
artiste, then here you go.

68
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,208
It doesn't get much bigger
than the illustrator for Kippu,

69
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,625
ladies ann germs.

70
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,458
He's available, he's interested,
and he's in my contacts.

71
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,541
[KEI, KOUSAKU, MINORI] What?!

72
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,541
When you say Kippu,
you mean THE Kippu?!

73
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,291
[laughs] None other.

74
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,041
You mean that one guy
who does all those

75
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,333
light novel illustrations?!

76
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,125
[laughs] That's him.

77
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,250
The genius who draws all
the critically acclaimed

78
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,291
pinup girl artwork?!

79
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,041
[laughs] Indeed.

80
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,250
The same dude who fell from
grace with the art community

81
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,333
not long ago for manga-fying
some lameass story about

82
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,125
Ag students and whose family
threatened to cut him off

83
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,708
if he didn't rethink
his career choices?!

84
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,541
[laughs] Yes, I think
we all know it is.

85
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,541
[KEI]
And he's sincerely interested?

86
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,125
[KANEGAMI]
Well he is a professional.

87
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,750
If the price is right, I think
we should consider him sincere.

88
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,791
He's worth every penny,
I can assure you.

89
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,500
Wow. You hear that?

90
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,750
That's the sound of us
actually having a shot at this!

91
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,625
[laughs] Lend me a hand,
my lovelies,

92
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,041
and I just might be able to
make it worth your while.

93
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,083
Huh. Lend you a hand?
What do you want us to do?

94
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,666
Look at me.

95
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,125
I'm not exactly in the yearbook
as "most trustworthy," now am I?

96
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,291
[KANEGAMI] But if I had fine,
upstanding students

97
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,916
like yourselves
to vouch for me...

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,708
We could get this thing
off the ground.

99
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,541
Ahh... So we're your
bargaining chip.

100
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,416
I completely understand!

101
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,875
Kousaku would be more
than happy to help!

102
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:21,958
Don't volunteer me!

103
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,208
Look, this is simple
risk management.

104
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,416
If Kanegami runs afoul
of anti-trust laws

105
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,750
and the school
needs a scapegoat,

106
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,125
somebody needs to stay
behind with the shredder.

107
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,541
Why does it get to be you?

108
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,500
[KEI] Basic question:
What are we planning to sell?

109
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,083
I'd say damn near anything
given this guy's talent.

110
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,500
A drawing of his
could sell ice to Eskimos.

111
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,333
Now, we got to balance
supply and demand,

112
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,958
so think stable inventory.

113
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,750
Best branding in the world
isn't going to do us

114
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,166
a whole lot of good if there's
nothing to package, right?

115
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,708
[KOUSAKU] Gotcha.

116
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,875
The trick is to sell something
we have constant access to.

117
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,541
Something with a yield
we can rely on.

118
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,750
I've got just the thing.

119
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,000
Excellent choice.

120
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,041
Oh yeah, those!

121
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,541
We have a winner.

122
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,083
Um, okay?

123
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,958
[KOCHOU] Out of the question!

124
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,708
[KOUSAKU] C'mon,
don't be like that!

125
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,125
They're perfect!

126
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,291
Your eggs are made for the
big time and you know it!

127
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,500
Ugh! Disgusting!
Moe eggs! Please!

128
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,416
The very idea induces apoplexy!

129
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,250
Producers with integrity compete
on the merit of their product.

130
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,791
Period.

131
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,250
[KANEGAMI laughs] Is it lonely
up there on your high horse?

132
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,416
This is no different
in principle than selling them

133
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,750
at the Green Shop.

134
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,125
Look, they're still being
touted on their merits.

135
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,916
We're just helping those merits
reach a larger market share.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,416
Ah! So it's you!
Why am I not surprised?

137
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,291
[KANEGAMI] Do we or don't we owe
it to ourselves and the school

138
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,416
to cast our net
as widely as possible?

139
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,208
And I suppose next
you'll lecture me on

140
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,666
laissez faire capitalism!

141
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,750
Don't think I don't know
what you're up to, madam!

142
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,041
D'aw. Please.
Why be so reactive, doll?

143
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,291
Take a moment to
give me a fair hearing.

144
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,791
Whatever I'm "up to" here,
the end game is this:

145
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,208
your eggs becoming
a household name.

146
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,958
Well...

147
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,041
I have to admit,
they are certainly worthy.

148
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,458
Just imagine...

149
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,833
[chuckles]

150
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,291
Think about it.

151
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,250
A carton in every
kitchen in Japan.

152
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,125
You know, I can't
think of another farmer

153
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,291
for whom that's true.

154
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,291
[KOCHOU] But we've
always prided ourselves

155
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,666
on the "locally produced" label.

156
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,333
Won't our regular
clientele feel betray--

157
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,500
Sweetheart, listen.

158
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,458
You've heard
the horror stories.

159
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,750
Feed laced with hormones
and antibiotics.

160
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,166
Unsanitary living conditions.

161
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,041
Now, haven't the corporate
farms had their shot?

162
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,875
Hasn't the public been subjected
to their "anything to fatten

163
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,666
the bottom-line"
ideology long enough?

164
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,958
C'mon, take your
place in the sun.

165
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,250
[KANEGAMI]
This isn't about money!

166
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,500
Oh, no. It's about
consumer rights!

167
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,375
Please! Do the right thing!

168
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,916
[KOCHOU] Y-Yes.
The system can work.

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,958
We can make it work.
I believe in us!

170
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,625
--I...
--[KANEGAMI] Game, set, match.

171
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,916
[KOUSAKU] Damn she's good.

172
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,708
[KOUSAKU] Okey-doke!
The product is Moe Eggs.

173
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:02,208
The mascot is Aleggsis.
We brand aggressively.

174
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,500
Come on! Let me hear you!

175
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,791
[ALL] Woo-hoo!

176
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,541
[KOUSAKU] So... How we doing?

177
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,250
Not so bad.
People seem to like the blog.

178
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,000
Great! Post the
four-panel manga!

179
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,458
How's the print media campaign?

180
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,125
Just bought space in
three issues of a top anime mag!

181
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,625
[phone rings]

182
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,833
Hello. Moe Eggs.

183
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes. Yes.

184
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,541
Just one moment.

185
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,791
Someone wants the
figurine copyright!

186
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,750
Huh? Okay. That was fast.

187
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,291
Heh. They're falling
over themselves.

188
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,125
[KOUSAKU] Hmm... Now what?

189
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,250
[laughs] They want to
use it for an event?

190
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,041
I say let them have
the copyright.

191
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,333
We're an LLC,
so the risk is on them.

192
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,916
Either way, it's free exposure.

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,083
That's the ticket!

194
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,291
Kei! Give them the go!

195
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,750
[KEI] Roger.

196
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,791
[ALEGGSIS] Moe Eggs!

197
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,375
They like it when you
peel them a little rough.

198
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,458
So wet and slippery...

199
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,708
Go on... No one's looking.

200
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,250
You deserve the very best!

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,666
[phone ringing]

202
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,583
[KANEGAMI] Thank you
for calling Moe Eggs.

203
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,958
No, sorry.

204
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,250
We're not accepting any more
preorders at this time.

205
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,166
Yeah, that's right:
as advertised.

206
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,791
Order now and your shipment
will get there in 90 days.

207
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,791
Okay. This is
getting out of hand.

208
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,625
Bad news.

209
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,208
The school server's down.
Too many orders!

210
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,250
Aw, man. This is
the last thing we need!

211
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,583
Oh, no. They'll start
burning up the phones.

212
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,000
[KOUSAKU] Alright,
that settles it.

213
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,333
We need a phone bank
in here, STAT.

214
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,583
First things first.

215
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,291
We've got to get these
packed up and shipped!

216
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,791
[KOUSAKU] Right, right.
Man, we need more hands.

217
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,625
Got anybody we can
bring in on this?

218
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,458
[KOCHOU] Sell my little
porcelain orbs, sell!

219
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,416
[phones ringing]

220
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,625
[STUDENTS talking,
phones ringing]

221
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,500
[KOUSAKU] Look, I'm telling you:
twins are the way to go.

222
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,208
[KANEGAMI] Perfect choice for
branding double-yolk eggs.

223
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,791
I say yes.

224
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,916
[KOUSAKU] I'm leaning toward
"Hard-Boiled Shelly"

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,416
and "Ramona Ramekin."

226
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,291
[MINORI] Ooh, I like that!
Plays up their versatility!

227
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,708
[RINGO] Bad news. I think
We have a graphics issue.

228
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,458
What in the name of...?

229
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,000
What is that?!

230
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,458
[KOUSAKU] Gross!
She's old enough to be my mom!

231
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,000
I thought we were all
in agreement to go Lolita.

232
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,583
I, uh, think there's
been a misunderstanding.

233
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,625
[KOUSAKU]
This is not good, people!

234
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,666
[chuckles] Older women
have their charms.

235
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,833
Th-They do?

236
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,250
[KANEGAMI] Call her experienced.

237
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,750
She's a shoe-in for
the soft-boiled line.

238
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,458
[ALL] Ooh!

239
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,708
[KOUSAKU] Make it happen!

240
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,916
[KOCHOU] Aye-aye, sir!

241
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,958
[KOUSAKU] Throw up a
teaser on the website!

242
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,291
[MINORI] All over it!

243
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,750
[goat bleats]

244
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,208
[KEI] I want out.

245
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,541
[KOUSAKU] Eh? Why?
We're kicking ass!

246
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,583
[KEI] I'll be honest with you:
I don't like where we're headed.

247
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,166
Just look at us.

248
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,833
Don't you resent having to fall
back on cheap marketing tricks?

249
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:57,166
[gasps]
It's about exposure, man.

250
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,666
How else are our eggs going
to compete in a global market?

251
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,750
Or don't you believe in
our product?

252
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,041
Hah. As usual, you've put
the cart before the horse.

253
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,541
[KOUSAKU gasps]

254
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,541
Oh, I'm putting the
cart before the horse?

255
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,958
How about you think
outside the box?!

256
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,708
Hah. Whatever, man.

257
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,708
Have fun playing
corporate tycoon.

258
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,875
[gasps]

259
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,083
Giddyup, Jun.

260
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,541
[goat bleats]

261
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,958
[KEI] Heeyah!

262
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:22,875
Kei, wait!

263
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,750
[goat bleats]

264
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,541
Ugh. He's going to break
that poor thing's back.

265
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,333
[ANCHOR]
You've heard the hype,

266
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,125
you probably have a carton of
her eggs in your refrigerator.

267
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,750
Now hear first-hand from
the chicken lady herself

268
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,375
whose business went
from modest to Moe

269
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,791
in a mindboggling
matter of weeks,

270
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,375
whether or not there's
a correlation between

271
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,958
egg consumption and cup size.

272
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,500
Well organically produced eggs
are a good source of protein,

273
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,000
so it's reasonable to posit
a relationship-- Ugh!

274
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,250
I did not agree
to debase myself!

275
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,166
She sure has become a celebrity.

276
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,250
[chuckles] Yeah,
the camera adores her.

277
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,625
Did you ever think the company
would take off like this?

278
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,916
I don't know. Maybe.

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,708
I mean, I figured
we'd do well-- Whoops.

280
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,375
There. Don't want
the meat to catch fire.

281
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,375
You want intestines a little
crispy, but not well done.

282
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,541
When the fat's crackling,

283
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,291
that's the sign to
move it off the heat.

284
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,000
Voila.

285
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,666
That's a new one to me.

286
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,458
Oh, nice! Absolutely perfect!

287
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,416
It's a good metaphor
for business.

288
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,708
When it's cooked
to perfection, you're done.

289
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,375
You've got to know
when to move on.

290
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,500
It's the difference between a
gourmand and a pyromaniac.

291
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,958
Huh.

292
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,458
[KOUSAKU] So what's next
on the board for Moe Eggs?

293
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,291
That's the point
I'm trying to make.

294
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,791
Moe Eggs is a thing of the past.

295
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,708
What? But, we...

296
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,500
Local farmers will
buy the trademark.

297
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,916
The school will make a killing.

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,208
And we move on to other things.
All for the best really.

299
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,958
Our business venture has
been a shot in the arm

300
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,000
for the local economy.

301
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,291
We're selling out?

302
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,666
Well, sort of. But we
won't reap a profit.

303
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,916
Students aren't legally allowed
to exploit the school

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,833
for personal gain.
You do know that, right?

305
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,416
Hang on--!

306
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,291
Easy now, Rockefeller.

307
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,833
Ag training's not about making
returns on the produce we grow.

308
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,916
It's about learning
how to make returns.

309
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,416
Think of it like a
financial laboratory.

310
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,041
Now's the time for
experimentation,

311
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,583
not portfolio building.

312
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,916
Which is great, 'cause once
we're out in the real world,

313
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,125
we won't have the
safety nets we have here.

314
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,583
We mess up, we make
bad business choices...

315
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,041
We're on our own.

316
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,666
See, kid. There'll be
plenty of time to amass

317
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,416
our fortunes once
we've graduated.

318
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,625
For the moment, the trick is to
take advantage of our freedom.

319
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,333
[KANEGAMI] A gourmand enjoys
a dish cooked to perfection.

320
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,416
A pyro just ends up
getting burned.

321
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,875
[KOUSAKU] Kanegami.

322
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,250
[KANEGAMI] Yeah?

323
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,375
[KOUSAKU] Well. I don't
really know how to put this.

324
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,583
I guess I always thought your
whole MO was making money.

325
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,625
[KANEGAMI laughs]
Don't get me wrong.

326
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,125
Money's all that
and a bag of chips, no lie.

327
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,958
But it's far from the
be-all-end-all, trust me.

328
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,583
Thing is, when push comes
to shove, I crave adventure.

329
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,041
Passion. Sure, money
can make that happen,

330
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,000
but it's not the end goal.

331
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,458
It's a tool. That's all.

332
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,458
Wow, that's deep.

333
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,458
[KANEGAMI] Right. So.
Eggs are old news.

334
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,625
But, there are plenty of
other markets to tap.

335
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,291
[KOUSAKU] Such as?

336
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:22,416
Heh... Clearly the next
logical step is yaoi.

337
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,833
[AKARI] The B in Class B
stands for Boy Love!

338
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,625
[KOUSAKU yells]

339
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,208
[KANEGAMI] Nice of you
to finally put in

340
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,083
an appearance, Akari.

341
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,041
Garcon! Warm glass of milk,
please! No ice cubes!

342
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,750
What's going on?

343
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,333
The otaku market is setting
its sights on the female dollar.

344
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,250
Women are dropping
more cash on sex merch

345
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,875
than their male counterparts.

346
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,375
Maybe the modern woman
has become lonesome.

347
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,583
Whatever the case, only a
fool would ignore the trend.

348
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,416
[KOUSAKU] Yeah, I get it.
But, what's our product?

349
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,875
Try to stay with me, chief:

350
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,291
you know the fungal culture
practicum from Class F?

351
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,333
You mean those grubby
old logs they use

352
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,291
to cultivate
shiitake and shimeji

353
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,666
and other crap like that?

354
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,583
Think about it, kiddo.
You're a fungi, am I right?

355
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,166
[gasps] What does
that even mean?

356
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,083
Look, I got to be honest.
Mushrooms sorta gross me out.

357
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,458
Oh calm down, reverend.
It's not the 'shrooms I'm after,

358
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,208
it's the logs those little
fellas are cultivated on.

359
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,375
The market's screaming for one.

360
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,458
Wait. Really?

361
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,833
[laughs] The branding
creates itself.

362
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,833
The hell are you?! Crazy?!

363
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:26,166
[chuckles] Try to be objective
for a moment, please.

364
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,250
The demand-side definitely
has an upper limit.

365
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,291
--It'll be a cash-grab
--[AKARI] O.M.G....

366
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,916
--pure and simple, you dig?
--I can't look away...

367
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,916
We'll adopt a
hit-and-run strategy

368
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,708
that'll maximize
our market impact.

369
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,666
I, uh... think you might be
taking things too...

370
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,958
Hey, Suzuki, I could use a
little help any time now.

371
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,916
[AKARI] You know
what'd be perfect?

372
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,458
A little dab of yogurt
on the tip.

373
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,458
I am not comfortable with this!

374
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,125
Cross promotion!

375
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,333
We could say
"apply Class B yogurt

376
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,958
for mushrooms bigger
than your wildest dreams!"

377
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,333
[chuckles menacingly]

378
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,083
[KANEGAMI] You know what?

379
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,958
That's just insane
enough to work.

380
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,583
This is gonna be huge.

381
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,750
[RINTAROU] I ought to put
an axe through your skull!

382
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,500
Yeah, I know, right?

383
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,583
What do you say
we go to the roof.

384
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,083
Just you and me.

385
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,541
'Cause I really feel like
teaching somebody how to fly.

386
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,125
Maybe some other time,
that's not why I'm here.

387
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,750
I thought you'd be
interested in showing off

388
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,333
Class F's mad skills.

389
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,375
Very funny. Good one, man.

390
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,458
You think we train as hard as
we do to help make pornography?

391
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,708
[KOUSAKU] Believe me,
I'm as uncomfortable as you.

392
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,958
No worries, dude.
I get it. It's too weird.

393
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,916
I should've seen this coming.

394
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,333
But could you at least
have a look at it

395
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,666
and tell me whether
or not it's possible?

396
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,291
Fine. Technically it
couldn't be easier.

397
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,208
You drill yourself a big enough
hole, stick in the spores,

398
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,791
and then there's
fungus among us.

399
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,166
And if the log was carved
into a crotch-shape,

400
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,166
it would still work?

401
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,250
Not on your life!

402
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,041
Okay, got it.

403
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,125
[KANEGAMI chuckles]
That's a damn shame.

404
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,625
And here I thought we had
the perfect storm of skill

405
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,125
and target audience to flood
the Forestry department

406
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,708
with easy women.

407
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,583
[RINTAROU] Huh?

408
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,666
Oh, yeah. Of course.

409
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,166
If ever there was a product
designed for fujoshi girls,

410
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,291
this would've been it.
That lot loves their fantasy.

411
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,333
Fujoshi.

412
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,625
Genuine fujoshi.

413
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,125
Yeah!

414
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,791
Think of all the
lonely ladies out there

415
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,958
who dream of you
manly forestry types!

416
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,125
What you do is pure sex to them:

417
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,791
you hunks are like the
Texas Rangers or something!

418
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,666
Right, Kousaku?

419
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,666
Huh? Oh, yeah! Absolutely!

420
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,625
Like I said,
it's a damn shame.

421
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,666
Had we been able to make this
work, there's no telling

422
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,125
how many free-wheeling gals

423
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,208
would've been falling over
themselves to join Class F.

424
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:37,000
All those hotties desperate for
attention from big, strong men.

425
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,125
You know, maybe I was
jumping the gun.

426
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,375
I should hear you out.

427
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,833
[chuckles]

428
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,541
[KOUSAKU] So here's the name.

429
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:51,000
Ugh. Brace for it, we're going
with "Yeah. Pick That Mushroom.

430
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,583
There You Go." 

431
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,791
You're looking at hundreds of
years of mushroom cultivation

432
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,958
at its finest.

433
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,916
I give you the standard
shiitake mushroom

434
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,708
with its dark, meaty cap!

435
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,166
The shimeji, with its cluster
of fleshy forking tendrils.

436
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,583
Hungry, anybody?

437
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,208
Eight inches of thick,
magisterial heft.

438
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,791
The king trumpet!

439
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,083
The maitake, whose dark frills
give off an intoxicating scent.

440
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,791
Smell that musk!

441
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,166
The nameko, with it viscous coat
and suggestive skin-tone.

442
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,458
Careful ladies!

443
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,500
The lovely mukitake.
Like a gymnast's six pack.

444
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,625
And the oyster, fungal art
splayed like a mosaic.

445
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,958
This is the stuff!

446
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,458
Call now and we'll
include with your order

447
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,000
the visually alluring
fertilizer mix.

448
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,708
Our very special
ANaL BB Yogurt Blend!

449
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,166
Now, for obvious reasons,
we can't sell this stuff

450
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,416
through the usual networks.
Not to worry, though:

451
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
we'll be moving units through
Bio's very own fujoshi pipeline!

452
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,583
Packaging will be plain. The
label will say "Folk Crafts."

453
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,916
[chuckles] Right.

454
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,375
Needless to say, if anyone
catches us selling these things,

455
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,958
we're toast. So let's
keep everything on the DL.

456
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,000
[KOUSAKU] We took advantage
of our freedom, all right.

457
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,583
The world didn't know what
hit it when we were done.

458
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,416
And we were done pretty quick.

459
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,625
[KOUSAKU] Just as we
were starting out.

460
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,750
We got busted.

461
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,291
Oh boy. Suspension.

462
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,750
[KOUSAKU sighs

463
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,291
[NATSUMI] My, Miss Kinoshita,

464
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,958
that yukata looks
fabulous on you!

465
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:23,833
Think so?

466
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,708
[NATSUMI laughs] Why yes!

467
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,750
They were made for
flat-chested girls!

468
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,250
[RINGO growls]

469
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,583
[NATSUMI giggles]

470
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,000
Just think. Caught 'cause
one of the top clients

471
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,958
was a classmate's grandmother.

472
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,208
Yeah, well.
Guess we had it coming.

473
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,583
Hey, look on the bright side.
It's like three days' vacation.

474
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,083
You got off a lot easier
than your ring leader.

475
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,208
She had it much worse,
appropriately.

476
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,208
Repeat offenders like her get
three weeks' suspension.

477
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,208
And all of Class F got a formal
reprimand which, believe me,

478
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,041
you wouldn't have wanted.

479
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,958
So... what happened to them?

480
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,750
[KEI] The forestry teacher,
Mr. Tachikawa, beat their ass.

481
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,250
Yeesh.

482
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,208
Their summer break's
going to suck, too.

483
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,416
They'll spend most of it
on Mount Onake.

484
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,750
Oh snap. Mount Onake. No thanks.

485
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,000
[KANEGAMI] I'm with you on that.

486
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,708
[ALL] Hm?

487
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,250
[KOUSAKU] Oh. Hey.

488
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,083
Got a new business
idea brewing.

489
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,708
For when I get back.

490
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,708
What do you say?
You interested?

491
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:17,875
Huh?

492
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,541
[KANEGAMI] I've got
everything lined up.

493
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,916
I just need your...
front-man skills.

494
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,541
Didn't think so. Oh well.

495
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,250
[KANEGAMI] One more thing.

496
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,833
Tell me. Did you have fun?

497
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,458
It's a simple yes or no.

498
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,791
[KOUSAKU] Hmph. Yeah.

499
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:56,375
[laughs]
Then my work here is done.

500
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,708
[KANEGAMI] Let's see how far
we can take this mascot trend.

501
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:07,083
[AKARI] Ooh! How about
a talking prolapsed anus?

502
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,750
[MINORI] Some people
refuse to learn, huh?

503
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh! Look at the bamboo!

504
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,875
Let's write wishes
for the Star Festival!

505
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,916
[KOUSAKU] Uhh...
What should I wish for?

506
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,958
[MINORI] Ah, there we go!

507
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,750
[RINGO] This is cool.

508
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,041
[NATSUMI] Too many, you think?

509
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,041
[KOUSAKU] Seems like
kind of a lot, yeah.

510
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,291
I mean, it's good
to want things, but...

511
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,291
[KOUSAKU gasps] You are
not hanging these up!

512
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,208
[NATSUMI] Oh! I almost forgot!

513
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,541
I want you to tie me up!

514
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,833
[KOUSAKU] Ugh. Who hired you?

515
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,208
I'm going to have a look at
what everyone else wished for.

516
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,916
[KOUSAKU] I like Star Festivals.

517
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,666
We all wish for
different things,

518
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,250
but the wishing
brings us together.

519
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:03,333
The deal is, none of us gets
to be happy unless we all are.

520
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,666
[KOUSAKU] Seems like
a good thing to me.

521
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,041
No, really. Makes us a family.

522
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,666
[RINGO] Sob Salad.

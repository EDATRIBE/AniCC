00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,166
[yells]

2
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,666
[MINORI] Thing is,
I want to be there for you.

3
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,916
[RINGO] Any village that
raised you must be wonderful.

4
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,208
[TSUKASA] Thank you for
coming ladies and germs!

5
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,583
How y'all doing this
lovely country morn'?

6
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,833
[CROWD] Finer than frog hair!

7
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,333
Alrighty! Now the moment
you've all been waiting for!

8
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,208
Let's get the first annual Aioi
village mixer up and running!

9
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,083
What do you say, folks?!

10
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,583
Who's ready to mingle and slam
headfirst into your soul mate?

11
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,000
[CROWD cheers]

12
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:18,458
[talking, laughing]

13
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,166
[KOUSAKU] Here you go, ma'am.

14
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,125
[sighs]

15
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,541
We got a live one.

16
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,500
I need you to get in there and
run interference for me.

17
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:31,833
Huh? What's up?

18
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,291
Be discreet. There's a
cougar at your 8 o'clock

19
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,875
liable to chase off the men.

20
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,791
Let her sink her claws
into you for a bit.

21
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,375
Eh? Okay, we must be
talking about a real piece

22
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,666
of work if she makes
you uncomfortable. Wow.

23
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,791
Deal is, no one's gonna
buy the age she put down.

24
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,750
Granted we all fudge the
numbers a tad

25
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,041
when we're looking to bag
a mate, but this is absurd.

26
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,291
She's just...
Well, see for yourself.

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,708
[TSUKASA] I mean... Damn...

28
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,750
[KOUSAKU sighs] Where is she?

29
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,208
[gasps]

30
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,166
Holy crap! You've gotta
be kidding me! Miss Becky?

31
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,458
What are you even doing here?!

32
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,208
And why do you look like
Ramses' the Great?!

33
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,250
--Forget it, General, I can't!
--You know this bag of bones?

34
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,458
[groans]

35
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,458
She's my teacher.

36
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,291
Good, so there's
no ice to break.

37
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,916
Go get her, chief!
You're my hero!

38
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,291
[sighs]

39
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,500
[KOUSAKU]
Miss Becky, is that you?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,166
Almost didn't recognize you,
you look so--eh, slender...

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,291
I'm on a new anti-aging regimen.

42
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:41,416
Strict fasting.
That's the secret.

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
Revitalizes the cells.

44
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,250
Huh. That's nice. Wow. Fasting.

45
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,666
I bet is shaves years off--Not
that you have that many years

46
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,208
on your back to shave off
in the first place, of course!

47
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,416
But you know what'll
work even better?!

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,166
Goin' organic!

49
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,250
Mega refreshed!

50
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,416
Poo! And here I've been trying
so hard to stay disciplined!

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,166
You're a terrible influence!

52
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,666
[KOUSAKU whimpers] Please
stop looking at me like that.

53
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,750
Sorry, my love!
Old habits die hard.

54
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,625
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.
Is this seat taken?

55
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,666
No. Please. Be my guest.

56
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,083
[giggles] Oh my, aren't we
a perfect gentleman?

57
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,833
A-buh-bayummm!

58
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,666
[WOMAN] So anyway,
so they were all up in arms

59
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,416
about the skirt being too short.

60
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,750
See, I'm in a better place
about my legs now.

61
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,750
Skinny jeans. That's the goal.

62
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,125
[KOUSAKU]
I've gotta do something!

63
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,958
Miss Becky's being swallowed
by the generation gap!

64
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey, there! Hungry?

65
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,125
Made fresh by the
Aioi Wives Association!

66
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,125
Oh, how cute! That smell
really takes me back.

67
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,708
Kind of reminds me of
cafeteria food.

68
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,291
[NATSUMI] I know, right?
Like whale fritters!

69
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,833
[COUPLE] Fritters? Do what?

70
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,750
Just where did you go to school
that they served you whale?

71
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,833
My grandparents used to
eat that kind of stuff.

72
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,458
Miss Becky, no!

73
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,625
[NATSUMI] It's too late.

74
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,833
I've held back as long
as I could stand.

75
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,416
I must unleash!

76
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,000
Crap! Not that!
Anything but that!

77
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,583
Forty-ish... Dimension!

78
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,875
[NATSUMI] Believe it or not,
home skillets:

79
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,875
Life before the dot com bust was
all that and a bag of chips!

80
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:36,458
Uh... O-kay. Is it just me,
or did it get seriously 90s

81
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,916
up in here?

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,416
[NATSUMI] What you want,
what you really, really want!

83
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,000
--I'll tell you what I want..
--Wow, that's neat. Uh...

84
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,750
I'm going to go
get us all some refills.

85
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:46,833
[NATSUMI snarls]
No you don't, Skinny Jeans!

86
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,916
[NATSUMI snarls]

87
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,750
[laughs]
Well, that was... a thing.

88
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,458
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

89
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:02,583
[sighs]
So, what brings a lady like you

90
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,541
to a country mixer like this?

91
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,541
I mean, farming's
so yesterday, right?

92
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,791
Oh, no! Farming's
awesome! Really!

93
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,041
Hunky men,
working with their hands...

94
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,791
Girls love that
whole thing right now.

95
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,791
I guarantee you every woman
here's in the market

96
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,666
for a farm boy.

97
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,500
[gasps] But what's the appeal?!

98
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,833
It's not like there's any
money working the soil.

99
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,625
Just back-breaking labor
sunup to sundown.

100
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,166
Oh, come on. It's exotic.

101
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,791
At least it is when
you're from the big city.

102
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,500
Really? But... I mean...

103
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,375
I'd think the big city
would be more exotic

104
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,083
than a pile of dirt like this.

105
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,416
Right...?
This is nowheres-ville.

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,625
Are you kidding?!

107
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,500
You have no idea
what it's like in the city!

108
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,875
There's traffic congestion,
office politics,

109
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,208
sexual harassment suits,

110
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,666
dog-eat-dog corporate
takeovers...

111
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,291
A real farm beats a
cube-farm any day!

112
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,250
At least here you're not
just a cog in the machine!

113
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,833
Huh...

114
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,125
[WOMAN] Sorry.

115
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,250

116
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,500
[WOMAN]
But you see my point, don't you?

117
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,291
[squeals]

118
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,666
Friends of yours?

119
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,375
I'm his queen.

120
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,125
And I'm his knocked-up wife.

121
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,125
How's it going, folks?

122
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,666
We good? Y'all enjoying
yourselves or what?

123
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,375
[CROWD cheers]

124
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,708
How about a little game
to loosen things up?

125
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,958
Maybe spice this party
up a notch!

126
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,791
It's time to give our
"First Impressions!"

127
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,041
Here's how it goes:

128
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,125
I'll unveil a word from the
easel and ask,

129
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,750
"Who's the most-whatever the
word happens to be," okey-doke?

130
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,416
Then, you point to the
person in your group

131
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,541
you think that applies to!

132
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,416
Ugh.

133
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,708
Oh! This'll be fun!

134
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,333
I'm liking this.

135
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,458
Alright, round one: go!

136
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,208
Let's see now...

137
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,041
Who's the cutest?

138
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,375
[KOUSAKU groans]

139
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,875
Yeah, you got it.

140
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,916
Come on, silly. Which of us
you going to point to?

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,916
Yeah, yeah.
You gotta pick one.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,375
Uh... Well...

143
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,750
I think it's pretty obvious
who I'm going to go--

144
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,583
Oh, that's so adorable.
My honey-baby's--SHY!!

really starting to heat up
out there, huh?

Moving on up to round two.

148
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,916
Who at your table
is the kindest?

150
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,708
Sweet pea,
you must be exhausted.

151
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,583
Why don't you let me
give you a massage?

152
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:20,500
Uh-oh. Somebody looks thirsty.
Baby wanna drink?

153
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:24,625
Uh... Sure, why not? Thank you?

--[RINGO] Hi-yaah!
--Not the face!!

157
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,916
[NATSUMI] Tee-hee.

158
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,000
[KOUSAKU yells]

159
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,500
[RINGO, MINORI] So... Who is it?

--[KOUSAKU] Forfeit!
--Next up!

00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,625
Who in your group
is the chubbiest?

[BOTH grunt]

164
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,125
Oh now, now. Be nice.

165
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,708
Didn't your mother
teach you not to lie?

166
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,125
Don't get defensive.

167
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,166
So you've packed on a
few pounds since coming here.

168
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,791
There's no shame in that.

really popping now!

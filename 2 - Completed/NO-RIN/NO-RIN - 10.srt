The Wase Shinkuro eggplants

Hello?

[MAN] Kei?

[KEI gasps] It's you...
How did you find me?!

00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,541
[MAN] You didn't really think
you could escape, did you?

13
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,166
Come back right now.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,416
I will not!

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,625
You and me, we're done,
do I make myself clear?!

16
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,291
[MAN] I'll be paying you
a visit very soon.

17
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,625
If I were you, I'd get ready.

[KEI] One phone call...

My past rears
its ugly head yet again.

00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,291
[NATSUMI] Oh no!
Everyone, I have terrible news!

23
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,166
With an entrance that dramatic,
this better be important.

24
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,583
It's bad. I don't know
how else to put it

25
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,208
other than to say the

Whoa. Is this the same mighty

The legendary warrior who killed

00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,791
[PRINCIPAL] What's that?

00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,500
No, I'm afraid you won't be able

32
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,166
Okay.

33
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,583
It's clear he's completely lost
his mind, but why are we here?

34
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,291
Well, that's a great question.
For the eggplants!

35
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,333
[GROUP] The eggplants?

36
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,458
[PRINCIPAL] Eggplants!

37
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,250
He keeps rambling on
about eggplants

38
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,583
and I have no idea why.

39
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,000
Stop it!

40
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,250
It's not like we have a
shortage of eggplants out there.

41
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,125
Why don't you just
give him some already?

42
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,500
Yeah, that's the whole problem.

43
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,875
I've already given
him eggplants,

44
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,125
but then he started saying,

45
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,875
"Hey. These are not
real eggplants!"

46
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,583
Rrgh... Oooh, that burns me up!

47
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,125
Do you mind if I take
a look at them?

48
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,375
Maybe there's something wrong?

49
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,000
[NATSUMI] Knock yourself out.

50
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,666
They seem perfectly edible,
in my expert opinion.

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,833
Well, he disagrees.

52
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,333
And since these
don't fit the bill,

53
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,625
I figured we could use our
own eggplants instead,

54
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,625
which is why I brought you
all here to save the day.

55
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,375

56
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,625

65
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,916
Those eggplants. Not a

66
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,375
[KEI] They're manufactured.

67
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,166
Wait. What makes you say that?

68
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,458
Yes, what exactly are you
blathering on about?

69
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,500
Sorry, but you're wrong,
I've tried them myself.

70
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,333
They're thick, fresh, firm,
and quite the mouthful.

71
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,375
See?

72
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,708
I can put the
whole thing inside.

73
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,250
[KEI] Listen to me.

74
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,750
If you let me use the
home-ec room tomorrow.

75
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,083
I'll show you what a
real eggplant looks like.

76
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,458
Oh, eggplant.

77
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,083
All right then, mister,
you said you'd show us

78
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,166
the real deal,
so bring it on!

79
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,291
I just hope your stuff
has what it takes, Kei.

80
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,666
If it disappoints,
then I'm stuck with

81
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,291
your itty-biddy eggplant
either way, huh?

82
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,625
[KEI] It's all yours.

83
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,458
Kei, no! Surely you
don't mean that?

84
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,541
I appreciate your
confidence, but let's not

85
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,791
get ahead of ourselves.

86
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,041
To begin, why don't we
take a good, hard look

87
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,291
at the eggplants
I've brought to the table?

88
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,916
Top of the line and
one hundred percent organic.

00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,250
Farm to table.
Five hundred a piece!

It's your move, Kamatori,

93
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,666
if you have one, that is.

94
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,541

00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,125
Before you knock it,
give it a taste.

00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,458
Unless you're a
"scaredy cat", of course.

101
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,416

Yeah, I'm shaking in my boots.

103
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,416

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,791
[KOUSAKU]
Yeah. Ms. Becky's eggplant

105
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,916
has started to let go
of its moisture.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,625
But Kei's hasn't changed at all.

107
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,500
And notice the size
of those seeds.

108
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,458
Unlike yours truly,
Kei's dish is disappointing

109

inside and out!

00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,625
But you guys

This is very delicious,

00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,291
That just might be the
best eggplant I've ever had!

Under-ripe.
Just a little, though.

115
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,916
And the skin's too tough.

Thank you very much. That dish

Mr. Kamatori. That,
my dearest young man,

00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,500
is an eggplant to rival

142
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,125
My friend, you have to tell me,

143
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,958
where in the world
did you find such a thing?

144
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,125
Well, as a matter of fact, I
grew it myself in my spare time.

145
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,583
Amazing.

146
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,666
But I must know, how's it so
much better than the rest?

147
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,291
The seeds are my

00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,666
See, the thing is...

151
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,125
My seeds are purebred.

154
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,000
they will always retain
their time-honored taste.

155
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,000
The reason those other

156
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,833

they're F1 hybrid fakes.

157

Wait a sec. What?

158
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,041
[KEI] First filial generation.

159
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,375
It's no big deal, just a
genetics term we plant guys use.

160
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,416
Bred for appearance first
and taste second,

161
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,958
these first generation

00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,291
for one reason
alone: efficiency.

00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,750
Efficiency?

164
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,791
[KEI] This supreme focus on
efficiency over quality

165
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,958
leads to the liberal use of
chemical fertilizers

166
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,583
and pesticides on F1 products
in an environment

167
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,125
that's as far from
natural as you can get.

168
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,958
If that's not a bunch of
manufactured crap,

You do make an excellent
point, Kamatori.

It's the truth,
plain and simple, sir.

00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,791
that gives some of our more
exemplary students

175
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,750
the unique opportunity to study
global agriculture abroad.

176
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,458
Miss Kochou Yoshida.
Mister Kei Kamatori.

177
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,208
Would the two of you
care to participate?

178
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,333
[GROUP gasps]

179
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,041
Well... Shall I do it?

180
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,541
Perhaps it might be
worth a serious think.

181
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,500
Large-scale agriculture
is flourishing overseas.

182
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,125
But, if Kei and I journey
across the globe together,

183
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,208
people might mistakenly
believe we're on our honeymoon.

184
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,500
Oh, what a delightful,
and romantic,

185
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,500
comedy of errors that would be!

186
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,541
[laughs]

187
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,708
Thank you,
but I'm not interested

188
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,750
in overseas agriculture.

189
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,375
I'm here to study
small-scale, pesticide free,

190
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,458
organic farming based on the
"eat local" concept,

191
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,791
not to learn the ins and outs
of mass corporatization.

192
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,208
[knocking]

193
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,666
[MAN] Excuse me.

194
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,208
[gasps] You! You're here!

195
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,625
So are you. Well,
what fortuitous luck.

196
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,875
You've saved me the trouble
of having to summon you.

197
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,958
I do hope you've made
your preparations.

198
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:23,833
[gasps]

199
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,416
--What's wrong?
--You okay?

200
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
[screams] Hey, I know this guy!

201
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,958
You were on "Sunrise
on Gaia", weren't you?

202
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:34,041
You're President Menjou
of Hexa Techs!

203
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,000
Hexa... what?

204
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,333
Hexa Techs is a
massive company

205
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,708
that does everything
from growing crops

206
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,958
to shipping them overseas.

207
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,958
It's the most successful
produce company there is

208
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,375
and he runs it all!

209
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,625
[KOCHOU] So, that means
Kei Kamatori is--

210
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,375
[MENJOU] My unworthy son.

211
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:53,291
[KEI] No! You're not my father!
You're not anything to me!

212
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,958
[MENJOU] Hmph. So, you're
his teacher I take it?

213
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,791
Yes, and available!

214
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,958
Please begin the process of
transferring my son out of here!

215
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,375
Like, very available!

216
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,125
[MENJOU] Gather up your things.
You're not to waste time

217
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,250
wallowing in a place
like this a moment longer.

218
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,333
How dare you?

219
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,166
What do you mean a
"place like this"?

220
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,500
Ah. Ringo.

221
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,333
Answer me. What exactly
does that mean?

222
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,916
[RINGO] This school is the best.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,791
In all of-- I was
going to say Japan,

224
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,166
but I really think
this school grows

225
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,166
the most delicious vegetables
in the whole world.

226
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,250
[MENJOU] "The most delicious
vegetables in the whole world"?

227
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,000
[MENJOU laughs]

228
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,416
[KOCHOU] Um. What is so amusing?

229
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,916
Well, I'll give her this much:
for a lowly ag-school student,

230
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,750
she does have a
strong imagination.

231
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,458
Like you're one to talk with
that F1 manufactured garbage

232
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,541
you call produce, you jerk!

233
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,833
[MENJOU chuckles] You've got
quite the lip on you,

234
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,250
but would you be willing to put
your money where your mouth is?

235
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,583
I'll gladly take you on
any day, old man.

236
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,458
[MENJOU] If that's the case,
how about a showdown?

237
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,791
[KEI] Bring it.

238
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,333
[MENJOU] I propose
a simple match:

239
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,083
your vegetables versus mine.

240
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,333
Whoever sells the
most product wins.

241
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,166
I do have one stipulation.
If I manage to beat you

242
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,916
fair and square, you'll stay
out of agriculture forever.

243
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,541
All right. But if you lose,
you leave this school.

244
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,291
And never come back!

245
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,791
[MENJOU] Good luck.

246
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,375
[KEI] I haven't shown this
to anyone yet.

247
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,291
But this is where I'm raising
my purebred vegetables.

248
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,166
[MINORI] So, this is where
you've been running off to

249
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,125
when you disappear
for hours on end.

250
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,333
[KOUSAKU] Geez, you're taking
care of all of this by yourself?

251
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,375
Yeah. Bringing back
heirloom vegetables

252
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,583
is a deep passion of mine.

253
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,250
Unlike my father...

254
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,583
The only thing he cares about
is lining his pockets.

255
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,958
Quality doesn't matter
to him at all!

256
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,833
Hey, Kei. I'm confused,
if Menjou's your real last name,

257
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,833
then how come
you go by Kamatori?

258
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,500
[KEI]
Kamatori is my aunt's name.

259
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,875
I asked her to adopt me,
and she did.

260
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:55,875
[RINGO]
You're adopted?

261
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,291
[MINORI]
But why forsake your name?

262
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,833
'Cause my stupid father is
a despicable human being!

263
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,500
[gasping]

264
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,166
[KEI] At the end of the day,
he's just a guy in a suit.

265
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,875
He has no real love
for agriculture.

266
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,791
All he cares about is business.

267
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,708
[MINORI] So, is that the real
reason why you didn't want to go

268
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,166
into that study abroad program,
because of your father?

269
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,416
[KEI] I love farming. And I'm
here because it's important,

270
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,375
even if it is
on a small scale.

271
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,000
I refuse to end up like him.

272
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,875
[KEI] Back home,
we tended a melon farm.

273
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,875
Without chemical fumigation,
melons are often prone to pests,

274
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,250
and let me tell you, our farm
wasn't without its share

275
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,500
of issues on that front.
But the problem was,

276
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,250
my mother was very sensitive
to these chemicals.

277
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,000
That didn't stop him
from using them though,

278
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,375
his eye always fixated on
the bottom line.

279
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,041
How awful.

280
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,666
Even after they killed
his own wife,

281
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,375
he still uses those chemicals.

282
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,916
Because when all's
said and done,

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,541
profit matters to him more than
anything else in this world.

284
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,375
Even his own family!

285
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,833
[KOUSAKU] I'm sorry. But if
that's not a prime example

286
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,916
of why all farms should
operate chemical-free,

287
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,958
then I don't know what is.

288
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,833
[KEI] Look,
this is a lot to ask.

289
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,291
And I know I shouldn't get you
involved in this showdown.

290
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,958
But the truth is, I really do
need your help!

291
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,250
We're here for you, Kei.
What do you say, you guys?

292
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,875
Sure! Done!

293
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,541
What I mean is,
from a personal stand-point,

294
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,333
I have no reason to care
whether Kei Kamatori

295
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,916
has to leave us behind.

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,125
But for the sake of Tamo-No Rin,
we cannot afford to lose him!

297
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,166
We'll show that old fart
of a want to-be farmer

298
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,958
who really runs things
around here!

299
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,583
What do you think
about that, Ringo?

300
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,750
He's going down.

301
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,583
We'll wipe the floor
with his dumb face!

302
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,083
[KEI] Thanks, everyone.

303
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,833
[MENJOU] Whoever sells the most
product in one hour wins,

304
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,375
plain and simple.

305
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,041
[KEI] Just to clarify, you mean
sales, not profit, correct?

306
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,250
Yes, that's right.

307
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,958
But we have the
same amount of market space.

308
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,083
You can try to boost sales
by selling at a loss

309
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,291
but it won't work.

310
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,916
I know that,
I'm not an imbecile.

311
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,541
If I were in your shoes,
I'd worry about myself.

312
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,041
Right. First thing we need
to do is set some prices.

313
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,750
Whatever his prices are,
we'll match them.

314
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,125
Huh?

315
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,666
[KEI] My vegetables are
organic and pesticide free.

316
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,208
Taste will win the day!

317
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,291
[KANEGAMI chuckles] Well,
look at what the cat dragged in.

318
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,291
[KOUSAKU] Whoa. What the heck
are you doing here?!

319
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,791
I came to help you.

320
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,541
Look: If you want to
sell some vegetables

321
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,125
and be filthy stinking rich,

322
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,625
then all you have to do is use
Class D's Ace Sales Technique.

323
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,708
You'll leave ol' daddy
dearest in the dust!

324
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,166
What's that sprayer for?

325
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,125
[KANEGAMI] Watch and learn.

326
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,208
[KOUSAKU] Incredible!
They look amazing!

327
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,166
Freshly picked, and covered top
to bottom in sweet morning dew!

328
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,708
[KANEGAMI chuckles]

329
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,958
[PA ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and gentlemen.

330
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,250
Visit the parking lot now

331
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,083
for a limited-time-only
fresh vegetable market!

332
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,375
All right! Let's get out there
and sell, sell, sell!

333
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,708
[STUDENTS] Yeah!

334
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,333
[WOMAN A]
It looks like it's pretty fresh.

335
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,291
But it does have
a very unusual shape.

336
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,375
And worms have been at it.

337
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,083
Yes, and that's proof
of its organic,

338
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,458
pesticide-free upbringing.

339
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,166
If you don't believe me,
have a taste!

340
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,791
[WOMAN A] Well. I suppose
that's why the bugs like it.

341
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,041

00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,541
And last I checked,
you had neither.

514
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,833
But at Hexa Techs
we have plenty.

515
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:13,791
So brand recognition
isn't the only reason you lost.

516
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,708
I've failed. It's over!

517
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,166
I'm a man of my word...
So take me where you will!

518
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,416
[ALL whimper]

519
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,416
No. Actually,
I've changed my mind.

520
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,750
You what?!

521
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,958
[MENJOU] I can't let my
company fail in the hands

522
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,791
of a successor that cares
only to grow paltry crops.

523
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,583
You are free to do
as you wish.

524
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,041
I don't understand!

525
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,708
[MENJOU] You want to win?
Then find a realistic method

526
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,208
to grow better vegetables
than your old man.

527
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,166
[KOUSAKU] I hope the
study abroad program

528
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,541
gives you what you need!

529
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,916
If I don't get to know my enemy,
how can I ever hope

530
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,500
to defeat him?

531
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,208
And besides, I really should see
what this world has to offer.

532
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,916
I'm a little worried
that you-know-who

533
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,833
hasn't shown up yet.

534
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah, where is Boobs?

535
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,208
[KOCHOU] Have no fear,
Kochou's here!

536
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,750
[RINGO] Oh, wow.

537
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:20,833
[MINORI] The little princess
looks like a bride

538
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,666
about to leave for
her honeymoon.

539
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,375
[KOCHOU] No, no, no, no, no,
you're wrong!

540
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,875
I resent the implication!

541
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,791
What you see here is nothing
more than proper etiquette!

542
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,916
You country bumpkins know
nothing of the chic world

543
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,250
of international travel.

544
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,291
Umm. Come along, Kei Kamatori.

545
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,791
Right.

546
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,291
Well, I guess it's time to go.

547
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,625
Yep. You guys be careful.

548
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,458
Woo! Bring me something awesome!

549
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,208
See you later, guys.

550
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,958
[MINORI]
Cheerful Farming Village.

1
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:11,916
[KOUSAKU] Hello again.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,458
Our story today begins a little
while after Ringo transferred

3
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,625
to "Tamo No-Rin High."

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,166
[KOUSAKU] Seriously, slow down,
you're stressing me out here!

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,583
Geez. Not like we have
anywhere important to be.

6
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,333
[KOUSAKU] Life likes to
surprise us sometimes.

7
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,666
Just when we think
we're comfortable.

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,125
Bam: Game Changer.

9
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,958
And all we can do is stand there
and take the moment in.

10
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,500
We've been terrorized!

11
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,000
Ugh. What a nightmare.

12
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,625
Maybe someone should
call the police?

13
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,958
Had a feeling this would
happen one of these days.

14
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,250
[GUY 4C]
There's not even a fence,

15
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,500
this field's
completely vulnerable!

16
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,541
Did anybody here happen
to see who did this?

17
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,541
If so, speak!

18
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,750
[KOCHOU] I saw it.

19
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,333
Yes. The perpetrator
of this foul deed was a child.

20
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,791
Child?

21
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,833
He was wearing a grey coat
or some such thing,

22
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,875
running off with his arms
filled with our vegetables.

23
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,250
Wait. What time would you
say this happened?

24
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,708
I believe it was yesterday
evening on my way back home,

25
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,291
after I finished
feeding the cows.

26
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,833
I would say it was a touch
after eight o'clock.

27
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,625
The fiend dropped this.

28
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,458
It would seem
you're telling the truth.

29
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,875
The question is:
what are you planning to do?

30
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,583
If it was a child, then you have
to impartially investigate

31
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,375
the facts and figure
out his motives.

32
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,583
Yes. We have to figure out
what happened fast!

33
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,416
Do you think it's possible
the boy did this

34
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,625
'cause he's starving?

35
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,916
Please, sir. Please,
may I have some more?

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
[GUY 4D] Aah!
Don't you people get it?!

37
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,375
If we don't get to
the bottom of this,

38
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,916
these kids will keep coming
around and eating

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,375
all our vegetables, willy-nilly,
with no consequences at all!

40
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,625
Hey, you guys!

41
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,583
The adults are talking, Minori!

42
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,125
In case you haven't noticed,

43
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,333
I am attempting to prevent what
could become a major crisis!

44
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,458
You know. It could've
been a monkey.

45
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,958
[BOTH] A what?

46
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,958
I'm picking up a monkey
vibe, aren't you?

47
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,000
This has monkey
written all over it.

48
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,416
You're wrong!
He was walking on two legs!

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,583
Wild monkeys may not be
able to walk for miles

50
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,333
upright like that,
but they can do it!

51
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,500
That's true. I've
seen them run off

52
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,041
with whole watermelons before.

53
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,333
[KOCHOU] Wait. You've seen
this with your own two eyes?!

54
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,875
[KOUSAKU] Minori and I
are seriously from

55
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,250
the middle of nowhere, so we
saw crazy stuff all the time.

56
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,416
[MINORI] Dogs, monkeys,
pheasants. You name it.

57
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,375
What is this?
Japanese folk hour?

58
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,500
Oh, man. I'm just glad
there wasn't a starving orphan.

59
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,500
[MALE STUDENT 4B] Okay,
everyone, we're done!

60
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,333
What's going on?

61
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:12,250
Oh. We're just thinking we're
in for a bit of a battle here.

62
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,041
Let's do this.

63
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,875
[BOTH chuckle menacingly]

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,708
[KEI] All right.

65
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,041
Welcome to the first ever
"A Monkey Showed Up

66
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,833
and We're in a Jam,
So Now We Have To Come Up

67
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,250
With Some
Countermeasures" meeting.

68
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,083
[KOUSAKU laughs]

69
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,791
Now. Why don't we all
take turns making suggestions?

70
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,000
Oooh! Kei! Pick me first!

71
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,000
Back where I come from,
if we want to keep varmints

72
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,500
from treating our crops
like a buffet,

73
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,750
we build an electric fence.

74
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,083
Yeah, but... Couldn't the
animals get hurt?

75
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,750
It'll shock them,
but they won't die.

76
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,458
Yes! Commence
fence building at once!

77
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,666
[KEI] Hmm...

78
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,458
While the idea itself
isn't all that bad,

79
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,208
I'm afraid it's impractical.

80
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,833
[ALL] Yeah, why's that?

81
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,375
[KEI] We're flat broke.

82
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,791
[KOUSAKU] That sucks.

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,166
He's clearly hungry,
so why don't we just feed him?

84
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,166
[ALL] Huh?

85
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,666
It does seem like the
humane thing to do.

86
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,333
[MINORI] I get it now.

87
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,125
You're saying if we stuff
his belly till he can't eat

88
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,583
another bite, then he won't need
to mess up our fields anymore

89
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,166
and we can get back to
business as usual!

90
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,333
That is the greatest
idea of all time!

91
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,791
[KEI] Not bad, but there's
only one problem.

92
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,666
The food supply
isn't his only target.

93
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,666
He's been ransacking
our potted plants as well.

94
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,416
It seems pretty obvious to me
the beast is doing this for fun,

95
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,708
so I'm not so sure a
full belly will stop him.

96
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,291
[KOUSAKU] So much for that!

97
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,500
Listen up.

98
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,250
I've spent my whole life
battling these monkeys.

99
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,875
I know where
their weaknesses lie.

100
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,666
Sheer brute force is the only
way to stop these evil bastards.

101
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,833
Behold! I give you
Super Hitoshi, with thirty times

102
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,583
the power of the old Hitoshi,
a weapon guaranteed to blow

103
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,916
his monkey butt
back to the jungle!

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,333
Oh my. That's an awful
big gun you have!

105
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,666
[KOUSAKU] This bad boy
can launch up to

106
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,000
thirty fireworks simultaneously!

107
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,375
What the heck?
Well, that's weird.

108
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,458
Maybe the gunpowder's
wet or something.

109
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,875
Here, let me take a look.

110
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,416
[screams]

111
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,666
Kids, believe me
when I tell you this.

112
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,375
It's never a good idea to stare
down the barrel of a loaded gun.

113
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,625
[KOUSAKU] Who's idea was this?!

114
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,625
Poop.

115
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,958
Because you have all
failed miserably,

116
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,791
I will now unveil to you
my super secret plan!

117
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,083
All right then. Spill the beans.

118
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,500
Listen, Vulgarians.

119
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,083
As you know, humans and
monkeys are both primates.

120
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,083
If we deal with this rationally,
I think you'll see that--

121
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,458
[ALL] Hell no!

122
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,458
Uh. Whatever.
It was ingenious.

123
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,458
--You can't deny humans
--[KOUSAKU] Hunter?

124
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,625
--and monkeys are both primates.
--Yes. He's just one monkey.

125
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,875
It's not like a whole army.

126
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,166
We should be able
to dispose of it easily.

127
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,416
Dispose?

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,375
Uh. Kei. I know we've got
to put a stop to this,

129
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,708
but won't you feel bad
about having the monkey killed?

130
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,750
Farming is a brutal business.

131
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,291
Truth is...

132
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,250
I'm prepared to do whatever it
takes to solve this problem.

133
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,625
Ah. Yeah, okay...

134
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,125
[KEI] As a matter of fact,
I know a skilled hunter.

135
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,083
He's just the man for the job.

136
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,083
Hello. My name's Ohmori.

137
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,916
Wow. Guy's a total creeper.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,083
Whoa! Keep those
thoughts to yourself!

139
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,708
No, she's right,
the man's a troll.

140
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,291
Hey! Did you not hear
what I just said?!

141
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,666
[KOCHOU]
Surely this isn't your man.

142
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,291
You claimed you knew
a skilled hunter.

143
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,416
I'll wager the only skill
this man possesses

144
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,125
is finding the nearest
box of snack cakes.

145
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,041
[KEI] People are only 90% looks.

146
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,125
Which means there's 10% of them
that'll take you by surprise.

147
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,166
Ohmori might be large.
But he's large and in charge.

148
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,833
And he's a blowgun pro!

149
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,500
[ALL] You got to be kidding me!

150
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:16,833
Oh no. It's no joke. It's real.
Yours truly is the founder

151
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,375
of the Ohmori School
of Blowgun Arts.

152
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,291
That's not weird.

153
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,500
Okay then.

154
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,625
If you're a master,
where are your blowguns?

155
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,666
[OHMORI] Right here.

156
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,666
[RINGO] Huh?

157
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,333
[KOUSAKU] Seriously?
Those are your blowguns?

158
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,291
[OHMORI] They're my super
stealthy sniper blowguns.

159
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,291
[MINORI &amp; KOUCHOU]
"Sniper blowguns?"

160
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,000
[KOUSAKU] Right.
Of course they are.

161
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,666
Didn't mean to doubt you
or anything, it's just,

162
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,625
when I first saw them, I kind of
thought they looked a bit

163
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,833
like anime wall scrolls.

164
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,416
Oh. Actually, that's
precisely what they are.

165
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,416
[KOUSAKU] Huh?

166
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,875
These puppies make
decent blowguns

167
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,541
if you remove the thumb tacks,
take them off your wall,

168
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,666
and roll them up.

169
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,375
[KOUSAKU] Uh, yeah,
I can see they do.

170
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,708
So, Mr. Ohmori, if you

00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,583
and that I needed to relax.

342
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,708
But I really didn't
think much of it.

343
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,750
I figured I was just tired.

344
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,041
[RINGO] But. Over time,
I completely lost

345
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,791
the ability to smile.

346
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,958
Eventually, I couldn't summon up
other expressions either.

347
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,291
The way things were,

348
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,583
it didn't make sense for me
to stay where I was.

349
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,583
So I left,
just like that monkey.

350
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,166
Yeah... But...

351
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,750
In the end, the monkey found a
safe place where he belonged.

352
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,750
So you can too--

353
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,625
That's nice. Thanks.

354
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,916
[RINGO] But there's no point.

355
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,000
How can someone
not be able to smile?

356
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,583
It just doesn't make any sense.

357
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,375
I'm guessing it's psychological.

358
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:27,125
That's the only explanation
I can come up with.

359
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,541
Maybe it was all
too much for her.

360
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,833
Maybe she got burnt out
living in the limelight

361
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,291
and always trying to meet
other people's expectations.

362
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,500
She needs rest.

363
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,208
That'll make her go back
to normal, won't it?

364
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,291
Well. One can always hope.

365
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,000
[KOUSAKU] I want her
to smile again.

366
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,250
Do you think it's selfish
of me to want that for her?

367
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,291
If it is, maybe I don't care.

368
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,000
[VOICE] Kousaku. Kousaku!

369
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,583
[KOUSAKU] Whoa! Who are you?

370
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,750
[DREAM WAKA] Do you not
recognize me? Silly.

371
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,666
I am Gaia.

372
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,541
Gaia?

373
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,166
[DREAM WAKA] Yes. I have come
to deliver a message.

374
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,000
Uh... What message?

375
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,750
You must remember, Kousaku.

376
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,125
Remember what mankind
has done to me.

377
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,083
Remember your ties to the soil.

378
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:30,708
Please. Whatever the future
holds. Stand firm.

379
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,125
[KOUSAKU gasps]

380
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,166
[DREAM WAKA] Gaia is always
with you, my friend.

381
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,375
Till the end of time.
Listen and you will hear me.

382
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,500
Imploring you to honor the land!

383
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,791
No. Don't leave me here!

384
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,708
Please! Gaia!

385
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,375
Gaia!

386
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,791
[KOUSAKU gasps]

387
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,208
[KOUSAKU]
What was all that? Wacky.

388
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,833
[KOUSAKU] "Remember what
mankind has done to me."

389
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,875
Guys. I think I'm going to take
Ringo to you-know-where.

390
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,250
I really want to
show her that soil.

391
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,416
Good idea. After all,
she does have something

392
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,750
in common with it right now.

393
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,208
Yeah. That's true.

394
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,083
Maybe seeing that field and
hearing a positive message

395
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,458
would help her realize
there is always hope.

396
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,333
[KOUSAKU] Schools like ours
have things called

397
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,041
"Agricultural Clubs",
or "Ag Clubs" for short!

398
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,041
Well, at any rate, we're headed
to the site of a project

399
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,083
we inherited from some
former students.

400
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,000
[RINGO] A project?

401
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,416
[KOUSAKU] Yes.

402
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,583
And if you're willing,
we'd like for you to join in!

403
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:02,708
[RINGO] This is it?

404
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,791
[KOUSAKU] Yep!

405
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,583
[RINGO]
Not the tomato field over there?

406
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,416
[KOUSAKU] Nope. Here first.

407
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,958
[KOUSAKU] Try touching the soil.

408
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:12,666
[RINGO] Right now?

409
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,125
[KOUSAKU] Yeah.

410
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,750
It feels hard and dry.

411
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,250
[KOUSAKU] Mm-hmm.

412
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,958
The reason it feels that way
is 'cause the soil is dead.

413
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,541
It's dead?

414
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,208
[KOUSAKU]
It's a figure of speech.

415
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,291
Crops won't grow here
in its current condition.

416
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,791
That's so sad...

417
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,416
[KOUSAKU] It's replant failure.

418
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,333
Remember, Miss Becky
talked about it?

419
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,208
[RINGO] If you continue to grow
the same plant in the same soil

420
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,958
over and over, eventually,
it won't grow anymore.

421
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,666
Yes. That's exactly right.

422
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,583
People try to get
around this problem.

423
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,000
They use chemical fertilizers to
try to stimulate new growth.

424
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,666
But that only leads to disease

425
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,208
and winds up damaging
the environment.

426
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,166
What you're seeing is the
result of a vicious cycle.

427
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,708
[RINGO] Will the soil ever
go back to normal again

428
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,416
or is it dead forever?

429
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,791
The process takes time.

430
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,958
This field started out
with that very same soil.

431
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,958
It's been there
since the very beginning.

432
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,958
Previous Ag Clubbers
started this project

433
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,416
and we inherited it.

434
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,916
They worked for seven years.
Day in and day out.

435
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,083
Now it's our turn.

436
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,875
Seven years?

437
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,416
It's not fixed.

438
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,500
There's still a lot to do to
get this soil back to normal.

439
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,750
But even though this soil has
a long way to go,

440
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,458
this field is slowly improving,

441
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,375
doing her best to live
on the land she's got.

442
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,375
So, eventually, this
place will be reborn?

443
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,583
[RINGO]
Hey, those tomatoes look good.

444
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,375
Can I eat one?

445
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,166
What? Now?

446
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,166
[RINGO] I'd like to.

447
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,833
Sure. Why not?

448
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,958
Here.

449
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,000
[RINGO] It's bitter.

450
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,041
Yeah, that's 'cause
it's not ripe just yet.

451
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,791
Still, I'll eat it.

452
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,250
[KOUSAKU] Huh?

453
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,750
[RINGO] Yep, definitely bitter.

454
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:00,958
Told you.

455
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,666
Yeah, but...

456
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,333
I like it.

457
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,583
Whoa. You--!

458
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,750
What?

459
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,541
Wait, this one's
more ripe! Here.

460
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,458
It'll taste way better!

461
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,375
Mine is even riper than hers!

462
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,666
[MINORI] No, no, no,
stick with mine.

463
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,333
It's definitely juicier
than Kei's! Take it!

464
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,666
[KEI] Mine is fresher!

465
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,125
--[MINORI] Please!
--[KOUSAKU] Food made with love,

466
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:27,250
love of the earth, love of
people, spreads happiness.

467
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,416
The secret?

468
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,166
Reminding yourself
that it's Nature's gift.

469
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,833
Working the land is one the
greatest joys life has to offer.

470
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,375
One day, I hope...

471
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,333
I hope you'll experience
that joy firsthand.

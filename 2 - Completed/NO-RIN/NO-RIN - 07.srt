Come on, look at the
bright side, okay?

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,333
It could be freezing and we'd
have a bunch of dead vegetables.

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,750
Like our tomatoes and cukes.

6
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,875
Tomatoes and cukes
don't do well in the cold?

7
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,708
Nope. Low temps mess with
their growth and development.

8
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,958
It can cause them to
bruise super easily.

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,250
Wow. That's awful.

00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,333
Do soybeans do well in the heat?

12
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,166
Yeah. They'll be fine.

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,583
When you were
planting them earlier,

14
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,500
I think I mentioned how
incredibly useful soybeans are.

15
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,333
But what I didn't tell you is
that they have a special power.

16
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,708
They do?

major nutrients in farming?

19

[KOUSAKU] Sure.

Well...

21
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,458
Nitrogen. Acid. And Potassium.

22
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,083
Of the three, nitrogen
is the most special.

23
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,083
[KOUSAKU] It's true. Without it,
crops won't grow properly.

24

Nitrogen.

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,625
Yes. The mighty power of
the super special soybean

26
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,541
lies in its ability to
make large quantities

27
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,916
of the nitrogen nutrient.

There's a lot of the stuff
just floating around in the air.

30
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:12,541
Soybeans can convert it
to usable compounds.

31
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:16,041
Or... To put it another way,
they make their own fertilizer.

32
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,541
Soy beans are... neato.

00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,500
It's true. I even watered
them when it rained.

176
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,083
Well. For future reference,
best to skip the stormy days.

177
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,250
But a little mold's
not that big of a deal.

178
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,833
We'll take care of it.

179
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,916
Hey. Let's go take a look
on our next break!

180
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,041
[KOUSAKU] Let's see.

181
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,458
See it?

182
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,291
[KOUSAKU] Whoa... No way!

183
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,833
Is it bad?

184
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,750
Ringo. Go get a teacher, please.

185
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,875
[gasps]

186
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,333
Hurry up.

187
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,500
[KOUSAKU] Southern blight.

188
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,500
Wait, I don't get it.

189
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,041
What is "southern blight?"
Will the plants be okay?

190
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,791
[KEI] Southern blight
is a terrible disease

191
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,250
that can sometimes
develop in soil.

192
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,958
Crops hit by this disease don't
survive. They just fade away.

193
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,291
[gasps]

194
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,208
[KEI] What's worse is that
blight forms sclerotia

195
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,708
in the ground, allowing it
to keep multiplying there.

196
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,250
What does that mean?

197
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,750
It means the disease
contaminates the soil.

198
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,625
[gasps]

199
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,125
[RINGO] How can we fix it?

200
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,750
[KOUSAKU] Can't be fixed.

201
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,291
If any of the spores remain...

202
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,958
...then they'll infect
next year's crop as well.

203
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,208
To prevent that, we have to
throw out the soil,

204
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,291
and the crops, too.
We burn them all.

205
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,958
[RINGO] That's awful.

206
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,166
[KOUSAKU] This whole mess is
pretty hard to believe, huh?

207
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,625
[KEI] It sure is.

208
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,416
Southern blight turned up
at another school recently.

209
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,875
Apparently, we both use
the same dealer.

210
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,791
If only we'd heard
about it earlier,

211
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,833
we might've been able
to do something.

212
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:47,166
Maybe... But Kei... you know
this isn't your fault. At all.

213
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,833
[KOUSAKU] Minori. How's Ringo?

214
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,083
Don't know, she said
she wanted to be alone.

215
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,541
[KOUSAKU] No dinner?

216
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,000
She said she wasn't hungry,
so I set some food aside.

217
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:57,958
Kousaku?

218
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,000
Huh?

219
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,666
[MINORI] I think
she needs your help.

220
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,916
Talk to her. I'm worried
she's taking this on herself.

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,833
If she'll listen to anybody,
it's you. Please.

222
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,166
--[KOUSAKU] I don't know.
--Well, guess what?! I do!

223
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,291
Because that girl is--

224
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,750
[gasps]

225
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,458
[MINORI] Just go talk to her,
please. She needs you.

226
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,541
Ringo. It's me.

227
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,458
So look. Farming
can be really fun.

228
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:35,250
It can be one of the greatest
gifts that life has to offer.

229
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,583
But... at the same time
it can be really brutal.

230
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,541
That's why so many people quit,
'cause it's too difficult.

231
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,500
We work so hard for so little.

232
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,166
It's not like we're gonna
get rich doing this.

233
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,416
Sometimes we don't
even get paid.

234
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
[RINGO] Then why?

235
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,791
If the bad outweighs the good,
then why do it at all?

236
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,541
[KOUSAKU] Good question.

237
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,916
My answer is, "I don't know".

238
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,875
I guess I haven't figured
that part out just yet.

239
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,291
[MINORI] How'd it go?

240
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,500
[KOUSAKU] I'm not really sure.

241
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,916
Oh...

242
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,166
Well, it's like they say,
"time is the best remedy."

243
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,625
[sighs]

244
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,208
[KEI] Kousaku?

245
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,125
[KOUSAKU] Hm? What's up?

246
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,500
I wanted her to plant those
soy beans for a reason.

247
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,458
It wasn't a random choice.

248
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,083
In the same way
they enrich the soil

249
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,333
and give life to new things,

250
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,083
I hoped those beans
might help her.

251
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,041
That her soul
might be enriched.

252
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,625
And that she
might also be born anew.

253
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,166
That's really thoughtful.

254
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,833
Yes, it's just that... if she
were to regret coming here,

255
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,708
I don't think I could stand it.

256
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,000
Kei?

257
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,875
Yeah, what is it?

258
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,416
You're nice. And I'm lucky
to have a friend like you.

259
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,291
Same here.

260
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,416
Oh yeah, this is good stuff!

261
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,375
A deep, forbidden friendship
reveals its true nature

262
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,875
in a secluded greenhouse!

263
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,083
We can call it--[censor beep]

264
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,666
I'll even put out a fan book!

265
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,958
What?

266
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,125
[KOUSAKU and KEI gasp]

267
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,541
If we sell one thousand
of these bad boys

268
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,041
at five hundred a pop,
we'll be filthy stinking rich.

269
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,458
Who wants to buy a yacht?

270
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,250
This isn't really in character
for me, but I'm here.

271
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,166
I had a feeling my
services might be needed

272
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,666
and looks like I was right.

273
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,500
Hello there, my darlings.
Did someone say forbidden love?

274
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,333
I heard that phrase
and came as fast as I could!

275
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,916
[KOUSAKU] Uh, what's going on?

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,208
Does somebody want to tell me
what you guys are doing here?

277
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,416
What are these for?

278
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Duh. That's advance
payment for the footage.

279
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,250
Miso and a mountain lily?

280
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,000
Wait, are these for Ringo?

281
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,125
Uh. Yeah right!

282
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,458
[RINTAROU] "Ringo?

283
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,208
Of course they're not for Ringo,
why would they be?

284
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,916
It's not like we're too
embarrassed to give it to her

285
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,875
directly or anything!"

286
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,291
[RINTAROU fake cries]

287
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,541
Great! Now they know the truth,
you idiotic woodsman!

288
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,958
That was, by far, the
weirdest thing

289
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,375
that's ever happened
to me in my whole life.

290
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,166
Kei?

291
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,708
I actually think Ringo
will be just fine.

292
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,541
Don't you?

293
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah.

294
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,708
Kousaku. You're awake.

295
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,708
This is bad.

296
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:32,125
Yeah. Let's get Minori.
Ringo too.

297
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,500
[KEI] I called everybody
I could think of.

298
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,875
This is everyone who showed.

299
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,166
[RINGO] What happened?
What are we doing up?

300
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,958
We're here to pick
some tomatoes.

301
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,583
But it's so late.

302
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,375
Let's just hope
it's not too late.

303
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,083
Huh?

304
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,541
Come on.

305
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,916
Look.

306
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,875
[RINGO] They're splitting open.

307
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,208
It's been nothing but
hot and dry outside.

308
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,791
All this time, these tomatoes
have needed water.

309
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,166
[KOUSAKU] Now that it's raining.

310
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,000
The tomatoes will take in
as much water as they can.

311
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,583
They'll split right open.

312
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,291
Where am I needed?!

313
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,625
[KEI] Start with
that row over there!

314
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,791
[KOCHOU] Right away!

315
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,583
Focus on the ones
that haven't split yet!

316
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,041
[STUDENTS] Yes, sir!

317
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,000
[MINORI] We can still
eat the bad ones.

318
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,875
We'll just puree them, or make
them into jam, can them.

319
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,500
Keep on hustling, people!

320
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,333
[RINGO] I don't get it.

321
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,458
Why does everyone
seem okay with this?

322
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,958
You raised them so carefully and
waited so long for them to grow.

323
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,125
And now they're
completely ruined.

324
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,541
I don't understand why
you aren't more upset.

325
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,791
Hey. You got a sec?

326
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,708
[KOUSAKU] I like it out here.

327
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:21,375
Though you must really think
we're out in the sticks, huh?

328
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,541
You know....

329
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,458
I like it too, actually.
So much nature...

330
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,958
I'm glad.

331
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,041
[KOUSAKU] But...
There's no natural nature.

332
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,208
Not in anything you see
out here, anyway.

333
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,041
[RINGO] Hm?

334
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,125
[KOUSAKU] The fields, the farms.
The roads and the rivers.

335
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,791
People made them all,
bit-by-bit

336
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,750
and generation-by-generation.

337
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,708
Our predecessors had it hard.

338
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,291
There was a time when nature was
cruel and unforgiving to them.

339
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,416
And it's not just here.
Everywhere we humans live

340
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,833
is the remains of the great
struggle between us and nature.

341
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,083
A battleground.

342
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,166
[RINGO] Battleground?

343
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,750
Yep.

344
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,291
You know, there's a whole lot
that's hard about agriculture.

345
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,166
But at the end of the day, it's
more fun than anything else.

346
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,333
Just getting to watch
your crops grow.

347
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,541
And the same goes
for the people who made this.

348
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,750
It must have been joyful.

349
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,458
They pictured the kind of town
this was going to become.

350
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,250
They dreamed about us,
here in the distant future.

351
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,791
And with all that to look
forward to, they worked hard.

352
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,083
And who knows?

353
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,333
Maybe our vegetables
will inspire someone.

354
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,666
Maybe one day they'll
do something great.

355
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,416
And maybe they'll make
the world a better place

356
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,208
for us to live in.

357
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,750
But even if they don't...

358
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,125
Even if they decide to just
keep on doing their best.

359
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,208
Well, I think that ties into the
future of the landscape, too.

360
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,458
You asked why I do this?

361
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,000
'Cause I think we can
help people be better.

362
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,708
There's real power in what
we do. That's why.

363
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,125
I'm sorry.

364
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,458
That story went off the rails
pretty quick, didn't it?

365
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,291
[RINGO] It was you.

366
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,625
Huh?

367
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,583
The veggies. You were the
one who sent them to me.

368
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,791
Huh?

369
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,125
Back then, I was so
exhausted with my life.

370
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,958
It was like I didn't even
have the strength to eat.

371
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,166
Then someone on my staff
made me a salad

372
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,458
out of vegetables
a fan had sent me.

373
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,208
Even though I was
too tired to eat,

374
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,708
I figured I had to
at least try it.

375
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,541
But when I put it in my mouth,

376
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,166
what happened next
took me by surprise.

377
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,416
It tasted strange.
Not like what I expected.

378
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,833
It tasted bad?

379
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,625
No. Not bad. It was very earthy.
And tough in an odd way.

380
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,375
But somehow gentle and sweet.

381
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,875
Well, it wasn't that
big of a deal,

382
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,416
I just wanted to send you
some vegetables.

383
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,000
No. It was perfect.

384
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,041
It really was.

385
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,750
You'd given me
the taste of life.

386
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,375
You shared something I
never experienced before.

387
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,708
It brought me to tears.

388
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,958
In that moment,
I knew I'd be okay.

389
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,291
It was like someone was saying,
"If you trust this feeling,

390
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,166
and follow your heart,
everything will be fine."

391
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,291
Don't you see?

392
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:56,416
You helped me.
You helped me make my choice.

393
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,833
After that.

394
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,166
I happily ate every single scrap
of food you sent my way.

395
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,125
I looked forward to the letters
that came with them too.

396
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,666
From the moment we started
writing each other,

397
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,416
I knew beyond a
shadow of a doubt

398
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,875
that I wanted to come here.

399
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,750
It was like I could taste
how fun it was going to be.

400
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,541
Wait a sec.

401
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,666
Huh?

402
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,541
I... I didn't send
you any letters.

403
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,500
But... those vegetables
were definitely you.

404
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,916
Yeah, but I didn't put
my name on the box.

405
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,125
And no letters.

406
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,375
No, you... You signed them.

407
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,125
Those letters were
definitely from you.

408
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,208
And there was a picture
of everybody, too.

409
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,166
[KOUSAKU] A picture?

410
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,500
[KOUSAKU] This picture?
With a letter from me?

411
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,583
[KOUSAKU gasps]

412
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,625
The tomato tragedy is over!

413
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,958
I'd say it's time we had
ourselves some dinner!

414
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:55,666
--Hm?
--[KEI] Huh?

415
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,041
Uh... You guys...?

416
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,000
Dinner's a good thing,
so why do you look so stern?

417
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,541
Is everything alright?

418
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,541
There's something
I'd like you to see, Minori.

419
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,000
[gasps]

420
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,416
[KOUSAKU] Does this look
familiar? You wrote it.

421
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,333
How could you do
something like this, huh?!

422
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,500
Writing a bunch of
fake letters to Ringo?!

423
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,208
I mean, to Yuka Kusakabe,
pretending to be me!

424
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,541
[MINORI] I thought
you'd be thrilled!

425
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,541
Huh?

426
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,875
I was only trying
to help you keep

427
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,125
your super "creepazoid" factor
down to a minimum.

428
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,250
You should thank me!

429
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:28,333
But... Mm... Well.
That's thoughtful.

430
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,625
I guess...

431
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,791
Anonymously sending a girl
you don't even know

432
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,375
a bunch of vegetables for no
good reason,

433
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,541
that's a one-way ticket
to restraining order town!

434
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,416
[KOUSAKU] I think you're
missing the point here!

435
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,458
Just think how Ringo must feel
knowing all those letters

436
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,791
she read are actually
from you and not from me!

437
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:45,083
[MINORI] Hmm...
You've got a point.

438
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,458
Huh?

439
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,875
I am very sorry, Kinoshita.
I hate that I mislead you.

440
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,250
I only wanted to help.

441
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,666
To paint a picture of what
things are really like here.

442
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,833
But I see now
that I was wrong.

443
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,791
Okay. Stand up.

444
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,916
I wanted to meet you.

445
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,375
This whole time...
It was you...

446
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,708
Uh... Kinoshita?

447
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,541
[RINGO] All I ever wanted was
to look you in the eyes

448
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,375
and talk to you.

449
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,000
About school,
agriculture, all of it.

450
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,291
The way you did in your letters.

451
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,875
I wanted it more than
you could possibly know.

452
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,250
So, you're not upset?

453
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,541
Of course not.

454
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,166
[MINORI] I pretended
to be somebody else.

455
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,416
I lied to you.

456
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,958
But what you wrote
was true.

457
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,625
That counts for
something, right?

458
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,625
And besides...
If we're being real,

459
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,125
it's not like I was
entirely truthful either.

460
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,625
We're even. Truce?
What do you say?

461
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,083
Yeah, sure.

462
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,250
I guess we're all kind
of similar in some ways.

463
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,083
[BOTH giggle]

464
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,375
[KOUSAKU sighs]

465
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,250
[RINGO] Hey. Can I
call you "Minnopio?"

466
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,750
[MINORI] Sure!

467
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,666
I don't mind that as long as
I can call you "Ringotchi!"

468
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,708
[RINGO] I'd like that!

469
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,041
--Awesome!
--Minoppio.

470
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,958
I sure love you.

471
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,708
I like where this is headed.
Kinoshita's happy again,

472
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,041
mysteries have been solved,
and all's well.

473
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,833
Looks like a
fairy tale ending to me.

474
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,166
Well, I think
this is the worst!

475
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,958
Happily ever after, my ass!

476
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,333
[AKARI] Cooking Granny.

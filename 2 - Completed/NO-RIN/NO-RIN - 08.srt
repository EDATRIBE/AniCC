[KOUSAKU] Tamo No-Rin High
School, Class 2-A Daily Journal.

2
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,958
Entry by Kousaku Hata.

3
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,125
Today was pretty
typical, actually.

4
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:24,541
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Same people, same routine.

5
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,208
Everybody just
keeping on keeping on.

6
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,416
Kind of a yawn-fest, really.

7
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,875
[KOUSAKU] I helped check out the
cornstalks,

8
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,666
making sure that bugs or disease
weren't getting to them.

9
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,666
Ah... You need
something, Yoshida?

10
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,791
[gasps]

11
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,625
Hey, what's up? I didn't know
you were on corn duty.

12
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,791
Yeah. Me neither.

13
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,458
Not that it
particularly matters,

14
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,666
but I wonder what you
out-of-towners are doing

15
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,916
for summer break?

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,333
So far all we know
is our training schedule.

17
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,208
[KOCHOU] W-What about Kamatori?

18
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,458
Is he going home?
Sticking around?

19
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,750
[KOUSAKU] I don't know.

20
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,541
One way to find out, though.

21
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:35,958
Hey, Kei!

22
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,125
[KOCHOU] Ugh! Dammit!
Were you dropped on your head?!

23
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,416
Need something, Kousaku?

24
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,708
So what do you got
lined up for this summer?

25
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,083
Probably stay on campus
and work for a bit.

26
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,541
We should make a trip
down to the beach, yeah?

27
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,583
You want to come with?

28
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,458
[KOCHOU] B... B... You idiot!

29
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,875
How dare you invite me to
tag along all casual-like?

30
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,208
You've got some nerve!

31
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,375
So, you don't want to go
on a beach trip with Kei?

32
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,833
Must we hold this conversation
out in the open for all to see?

33
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,291
You are an evil mastermind!

34
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,375
Or an idiot! I can't tell which!

35
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,833
Shh!

36
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,083
I don't hear any birds.

37
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,416
Or the livestock.

38
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,916
[goat bleats]

39
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,000
Something's coming.
Kei, what is it?

40
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,500
Something... inhuman.

41
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,416
It's here!

42
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,125
[gasps]

43
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,583
It's a demon!

44
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,333
You like a boy?

45
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,375
Where's mine?!

46
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,750
Of course!

47
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,916
It was summoned by Yoshida's
obvious love for Kei,

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,166
which I totally didn't
mean to out, but whatever!

49
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,000
Huh? How's it my fault?!

50
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,583
Run for it, Youkul! Go!

51
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,875
Dude, his name's Jun...

52

[NATSUMI snarls]

54
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,041
Yoshida! Get the
girls to school!

55
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,041
[KOCHOU] I'm on it!

56
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,750
Kei! Don't let the cougar-demon
touch you, or game over!

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,250
Horny teacher!
Calm your fury!

Whatever you may be,
cougar or spinster loli,

61

these boys are
not yours to devour!

62
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,250
Yeah, she ain't
gonna like that.

63
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,916
Young love can suck it!

64
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,041
[KOUSAKU]
Are you all right, Kei?

65
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,125
Yeah!

66
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,958
She's heading for the campus!

[MINORI] Ringo--no!

71
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,458
[KOCHOU] Are you okay?!

72
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,083
We'll never catch her!

Oh, Youkul!

Still not his name, bro.

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Yaaah!

[NATSUMI babbles incoherently]

80
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:24,958
All right!

81
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:25,833
You saved us all!

82
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,166
Goodness.

83
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,500
She didn't go down easy.

84
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,041
You showed her who's boss!

85
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,833
Yoshida, were you hurt?
Are you okay?

86
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,041
Huh?! Of course I'm okay!
Why would you even ask?

87
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,208
That's good.
Glad to hear it.

88
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,666
Huh...?

00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,291

start migrating south,

Tits McGee. You'll know
my suffering soon enough!

[KOUSAKU] Whatever,
Teach--you're just jelly.

92
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,416
[KOUSAKU] So, yeah,
corn duty was pretty dull.

93
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,375
And homeroom was
same old, same old.

94
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,750
Honestly, kind of...

95
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,000
...a bust.

96
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,416
Hey there, little lady.
So what caliber of ammo

97
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,625
are you smuggling?

98
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,375
H-cup? Or I?

99
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,500
Damn, they're big.

Hey! Don't give them
the third-degree!

101
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,750
But... I gots to know!

[KOUSAKU] That's enough
of that, fella!

103
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,583
"Fella?"

104
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,583
You think those sweater-puppies
can be kenneled in a cup-size?

105
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,458
That's like trying to store
the Sahara in a litter-box!

106
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,916
[MINORI] Huh?

107
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,250
That said, if you want
to think about 'em in terms

108
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,541
of a cup size, they are...

109
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,375
World Cup boobs!

110
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,125
World Cup boobs?

111
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,583
[KOUSAKU] Duh!

112
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,041
No one country can lay claim
to such god-tier knockers!

113
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,958
Those watermelons are worldwide!

114
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,958
[MOBUYOUMA] I'll pass!

115
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,208
Big boobs are nothing more than
oversized bags of bovine fat.

116
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,375
Really, they do nothing
but hinder a woman.

117
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,000
Any busty girl
will tell you so.

118
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,541
Yeah! A-cup forever, haters!

119
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,541
[KOUSAKU whimpers] Seriously?!

120
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,958
Hey, Boss!

121
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,000
You want to drop some knowledge
about the itty-bitties?

122
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,791
Don't call me "Boss".

123
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,416
Call me "Big Brother"!

124
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,875
What the hell?

125
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,541
Allow me to demolish
his worldview.

126
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,000
[KOUSAKU] Sure.

127
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,125
Men are creatures that wish
to be mothered on some level.

128
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,458
Nothing symbolizes that role
as well, as the breast.

129
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:17,333
Ergo, huge breasts
are the realm of the real man!

130
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,458
Says you.

131
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,708
[KEI] What?!

132
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,333
The desire for mothering
is a real phenomenon.

133
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,625
However... Any self-respecting
guy should be well

134
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,291
out of that phase
by high school.

135
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,083
As they break away
from their parents

136
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,916
and become men
in their own right,

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,041
a new desire starts
to rear its head!

138
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,500
You're overlooking a
biological directive!

139
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,291
What is it? Enlighten me,
tiny schoolgirl!

140
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,875
[RORIITA] Behold!
Paternal instinct!

141
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,291
[KEI gasps] Say what?

142
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,041
[RORIITA] As a boy
grows into a man,

143
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,833
he awakens to a new
paternal instinct within.

144
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,833
What use has he for teats?

145
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,458
Giving a little girl
fatherly love

146
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,000
is the most natural of acts
for a grown male!

147
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,291
Anything less is a case
of arrested development!

148
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,000
Yay! [giggles]

149
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,541
Higher, big brother!

150
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,791

[GIRL] Uh-huh!
I love you, big brother!

152
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:21,791
[KEI] I admit. Such a
scenario is appealing.

153
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,833
Yikes...

154
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,625
[laughs] So,
what size do you like?

155
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,625
Huh? Boob-wise?

156
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,166
Mmm...

157
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,791
You know, boobs are nice and
all, but at the end of the day,

158
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,041
I'm more of a foot guy, really.

159
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,708
[RORIITA] Huh?

160
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,208
[KOUSAKU] Yeah.

161
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,791
Like the soles of a girl who's
wearing black knee-highs.

162
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,833
Or maybe she's been clomping
around in shoes all day,

163
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,833
and now they're,
you know... musty...

--[KOUSAKU giggles]
--[KEI] Are you having fun?

165
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,125
--Why, yes... Yes I would!
--No, big brother's arms

166
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,916
--like to rub them for you!
--aren't getting tired at all!

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,416
'Sup, guys! How's it hangin'?

168
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,250
[NATSUMI] C'mon!
That was totes adorbs!

How come you're so
mean to me? Boo-hoo!

I'm trying to be as young
and lively as possible!

172

You've got to respect that!

[STUDENTS] No, we don't!
You look ridiculous!

174
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,208
Better to be ridiculous
than dead!

175
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,666

Burn them with moe!

178
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,833
She's so powerful! How could
a woman her age be so strong?

179
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,041
In a world where
couples are running amok,

180
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,125
she appears to punish us
for their happiness!

181
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,250
She fights with the force of a
thousand ignored

182
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,291
online-dating profiles!
She rises from the ashes

183
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,875
of her own wreck of a
love-life again and again!

184
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,125
She is the
perpetually-single Phoenix!

185
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,083
Run, you fools!
Get out of here!

186
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,375
Wrong Side of Forty.

187
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,125
Genma. Fist!

Middle school.

High school.

Work.

196
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,750
Suddenly, I was forty...

197
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,708
...and just as friggin'
lonely as ever...

198
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,625
Even my 13-year-old niece
has a boyfriend.

199
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,291
Seriously, life,
what the actual hell?

200
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,958
[STUDENTS] Holy crap!

201
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,666
Wrinkles! The wrinkles
are everywhere!

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,333
[wails] My boobs
will be down to my feet!

203
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,458
Going out to eat, and
every single time

204
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,166
it's the same thing:
"Becky, party of one!"

205
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,833
The future...
it really sucks!

206
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:37,583
I never knew that being
an adult was so horrible!

207
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,958
It's nothing but loneliness!

208
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,291
Day after day,
a never-ending parade of suck!

209
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,916
We'd all be better off dead!

[STUDENTS scream]

211
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,666
That took the piss
outta ya, huh?!

[screaming]

213
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,916
Now, who loves Becky?

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,875
[STUDENTS] Me.

215
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,166
[KOUSAKU] The afternoon
class was Home Ec.

216
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,000
"If you make something
good to eat...

217
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,166
...you'll have 'em lined
up down the street."

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:09,791
It's Kousaku's...

219
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,166
...and Ringo's...

...cooking show!
"Let's Go Home Ec!"

00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,625
Hey, everybody,
you know what time it is.

222
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,458
Let's bring out our guest
instructor for the day, yeah?

223
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,583
[KOUSAKU] She was top of
her class in culinary school,

224
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,875
and won the Worldwide
Singles Cooking Contest

225
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,041
22 years in a row!
You know her...

226
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:31,958
You love her...

227
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:32,708
...kind of...

228
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,625
It's Ms. Becky!

229
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:38,791
I say 40 is the new 18!

230
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,291
Well, Ms. Becky, you certainly
seem glad to be here.

231
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,291
[phone vibrates]

232
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,500
Is that a phone?
Come on, you guys.

233
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,500
It's really distracting to hear
that in the middle of a--

234
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,041
Oh, my bad.

235
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,041
You want to answer it?

236
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,541
That is not a phone!

237
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,458
All-righty!

238
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,083
Today's dish is so good,

239
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,666
just one bite and any man
will be yours forever!

240
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,625
[giggles]

241
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,875
[KOUSAKU sighs]

242
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,708
Better eat up!
This feline's got needs, Hata!

243
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,333
Me-Meow!

244
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,750
Kill me.

245
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,750
Put something in his
mouth that he likes.

246
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,208
Maybe he'll return the favor!
Know what I mean?

247
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,375
Hata, what do you like to eat?

248
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,208
[coughs] I'm not really
that picky, but...

249
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,250
I kind of draw the line
at natto. I mean, it's so--

250
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,750
What the hell
do you like to eat?!

251
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,750
It wasn't a
hard question, was it?!

252
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,583
Time to shave
the tuna, you guys!

253
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,125
Now...

254
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,666
Check it out. Skipjack.

255
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,166
No second-rate bonito
for you guys.

256
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,125
Well, Ringo, how do you
think it smells?

257
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,958
Like tuna, because it's tuna.

258
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,333
[NATSUMI] Aw, geez!

259
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,083
Stop the tape! Cut!

260
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,875
We got to take that react again.

261
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,041
Why'd we stop filming?

262
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,583
Oh, come on.

263
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,708
Check the mannequin for a pulse,
'cause that was crappy-crap.

264
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,708
I don't think color commentary
is Ringo's forte.

265
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,291
[NATSUMI] If you think you can
coast by on your fresh face

266
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,916
and thousand-yard-stare, just
sit your bony ass down already!

267
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,750
I don't think we need
that for this recipe!

268
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,083
Yeah. Calm your tits.

269
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,541
Now, I'll show you
how to prep skipjack tuna

270
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,458
the Ms. Becky way!

271
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,791
[sniffs]

272
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,583
Oh, my... This thing has
such a musky odor to it.

273
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,041
But I... kind of like it.

274
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,000
Wow. There's
something on the tip!

275
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,375
Is that what I think it is,
you naughty skipjack--?

276
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,583
No, it's not!

277
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,000
[NATSUMI grunts] I'm sorry.

278
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,375
I guess I got a little
ahead of myself.

279
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,000
Get it? "A little head?"

280
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,750
[KOUSAKU sighs heavily]

281
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,666
Hey, Hata! Want to
be a pal and shave this down?

282
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,750
Aw. I'm going to be sad to
see you go, mister skipjack.

283
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:38,875
You're like a giant di--

284
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,333
Kousaku reporting in
for shaving duty!

285
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,666
Shave, shave, shave...

286
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,208
Faster, faster!

287
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,750
Shave, shave, shave...

288
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,208
Don't be so rough.

289
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,750
Shave... Shave...

290
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,125
Gimme a Latin beat!

291
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,125
Shave, sh-sha-shave

292
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,541
Right, now show me your O-face!

293
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,083
What is your problem?!

294
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,375
After that, you fill up
a bowl with white rice!

295
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,125
[KOUSAKU sighs] Here.
Knock yourself out.

296
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,791
Then, you grab a
big bottle of sauce!

297
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,666
So what're we making
here, anyway?

298
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,250
What the--?

299
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,666
Rice bowl--voila!
Loved up and good to go!

300
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,041
Isn't that a bit too simple
for a cooking show?

301
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,333
Ah-ah-ah! There's no point
going crazy in the kitchen

302
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,333
when you're the only one
who's going to be eating

303
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,000
the final product, right?

304
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,791
Here's the reality.

305
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,958
On any given day, you just go
from your apartment to work

306
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,583
and then back home again.

307
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,750
[NATSUMI] At work,
your so-called peers

308
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,083
avoid you like the plague.
And they somehow forget

309
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,375
to invite you to their parties
every damn time.

310
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,333
When you get home,
you're too tired to do anything

311
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,458
but flop into bed and
sleep in your makeup,

312
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,375
'cause that's a good idea.
On your rare days off,

313
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,875
you spend all your time
being lazy and farting around

314
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,000
on the internet.
Why bother cooking for reals?

315
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,750
Now what do you think?

316
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,416
I think white rice
with toppings is okay.

317
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,083
On to another topic!

318
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,833
[BOTH sigh]

319
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,791
When you're cooking,
there are five seasonings

320
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,791
that are fundamental.

321
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,958
Ringo, would you care
to list them off

322
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,666
with that perfect little
poker face of yours?

323
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,708
Sugar is one of them.
Salt is, too. Vinegar also.

324
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:16,833
--And then--
--[NATSUMI] And then?!

325
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,083
Huh? Uh...

326
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,125
Ur-urrr!

327
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,291
Sugar, salt, vinegar,
der-der-der!

328
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,125
Der-der-der! Bwalala!

329
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,583
Enough smack-talk!

330
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,166
The other two are soy sauce
and miso, now aren't they?

331
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,166
Miso horny!

332
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,458
[NATSUMI grunts]

333
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,583
Hey wait, isn't it a
turn-on for guys

334
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,375
when they see a girl
cooking for them?

335
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,958
No way! That's just...

336
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,083
[giggles] You're home! Take me!

337
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,541
Ms. Becky, it's high time
we got down to making it, yeah?

338
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,375
What, a baby?

339
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,500
No, the food!

340
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,541
Okay, then! I'll get
the cutting board!

341
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,625
Sorry about that,
Ringo! My mistake!

342
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,791
Your chest is so flat,

343
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,333
I guess I thought it was
the cutting-board!

344
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,833
Goodness, I am such a bonehead!

345
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,250
--Maybe she'll have some boobs
--Down, Ringo!

346
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,916
--when she's older!
--She's not worth it!

347
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,875
And for dessert, we'll make
delicious strawberries

348
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,041
topped with condensed milk!

349
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,625
Wash and drain the berries,
then put them in a bowl.

350

1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,041
[KOUSAKU]
Summer's in full swing!

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,875
We're talking puffy white
clouds, cicada's buzzing,

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,250
the whole bit.

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,000
[chuckles] Nice!

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,208
Dressed to impress!
That's how it's done!

6
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,000
This doesn't make me
look dorky?

7
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,666
No, not at all.

8
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,125
[MINORI] Uh, excuse me.

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,583
Eh?

10
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,125
Well, do I look
adorable or what?

11
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,000
You definitely
look something.

12
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,291
Uh-huh. Say it.
I have a glow.

13
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,041
[KOUSAKU] Or a bun in the oven.

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,625
[MINORI sighs] Same thing.
Wow, just imagine.

15
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,916
The outfit might get people
thinking that you and me are--

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,291
[yelps]

17
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,166
Oh dear. Careful.

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,916
With a butt like that
you've got to pay attention

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,125
to your center of gravity.

20
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,708
Might help a little if
you didn't shove me!

21
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:01,291
Alrighty. Train's about
to leave. So, yeah.

22
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,375
[KOUSAKU] With Kei and Yoshida
doing their thing abroad

23
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,875
over the summer break, I thought
it'd fun to take Ringo along

24
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,541
with Minori and me for a visit
back home to the boonies.

25
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,125
But, oh man, was there ever
a perfect storm brewing.

26
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,916
Would I live to tell the tale?
Your guess is as good as mine!

27
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,000
[KOUSAKU]
The Nagaragawa Railway.

28
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,416
Naga Rail for short.

29
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,875
Run these days by a third-tier
public transit company,

30
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:54,333
it picks up where the old
Etsumi South Line left off.

31
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,500
[MINORI] Okay, this rice is
perfect for mealtime

32
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,750
on the rails.

33
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,833
[KOUSAKU] Mm. Very tasty.

34
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,708
So, uh, exactly how far out
is your hometown?

35
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,666
Oh, it's in the
middle of nowhere.

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,583
But, Minori's family's nice.

37
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,416
Give Ringo the rundown
on your three sisters.

38
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,583
Tsukasa's the oldest,
then I came along.

39
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,458
The two youngest are twins:
Takumi and Akin.

40
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,666
[RINGO] Cool.

41
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,166
Ah, Tsukasa. Hey, uh...

42
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,875
So she moved back home
not that long ago, right?

43
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,041
What was she doing?

44
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,375
Ahh... Little of this,
little of that.

45
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,500
You know, whatever keeps
a gal like her busy.

46
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,791
Heh. Guess the old crowd

47
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,958
didn't nickname her
"The General" for nothing.

48
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,541
It's weird she
came back, though.

49
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,125
Figured she'd still be
out there blazing a trail.

50
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,708
Uh-oh. Stay still!

51
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,166
[WAKA squeaks]

52
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,625
So... Some special reason
he's along for the ride?

53
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,666
Gee. I don't know, uh...

54
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,041
Little fella gets super lonely
when you're not around,

55
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,000
and he's got kind of a
sixth sense for where you are.

56
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,541
[sighs] Whatever. You're
keeping tabs on him, though.

57
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,458
Far as this trip's concerned,
he's your mess.

58
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,625
[MINORI] Mm-hmm!
In you go, love.

59
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,791
Make yourself at home.

60
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,250
[WAKA squeaks]

61
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,875
Uh. Okay. What the...?

62
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,833
[MINORI] I made a special
pouch for him in there.

63
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,458
Awkward. Now you
really do look preggers.

64
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,083
[MINORI giggles]

65
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,708
[ANNOUNCER A]
Attention passengers,

66
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,291
if you peek out your
window right now,

67
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,833
you'll see we're passing over
the First Nagara River Bridge.

68
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,125
So cool.

69
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,250
Check it out,
they're waving! Ha!

70
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,208
C'mon, you too.

71
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,541
Uh, okay.

72
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,416
[laughing

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,958
[BOY] Hello!

74
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,416
Hey, Kousaku?

75
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,833
Huh?

76
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,666
You know... I've been on
my share of trains and stuff,

77
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,875
but this one's
probably my favorite.

78
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,083
[ANNOUNCER A]
Next stop, Aioi.

79
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,333
Thank you for choosing
Nagaragawa Railway.

80
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,541
We hope you have a pleasant day.

81
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,333
[RINGO] Where's the attendant?

82
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,583
[KOUSAKU] Oh there isn't one.
The station's unmanned.

83
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,666
[KOUSAKU grunts]

84
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,541
[BOTH] Bubba! Sissy!

85
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,666
[MINORI laughs]

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,041
[TWINS] Welcome back!

87
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,958
[KOUSAKU] Taku and Aki!

88
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,000
Someone's been
eating their vegetables!

89
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,833
Hey! How come Sissy's
got such a big tummy?

90
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,416
Now, now. Don't poke.

91
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,125
She's carrying
precious cargo in there,

92
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,958
not just her usual roll of fat.

93
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,458
Ha! Well, well!

94
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,333
You just couldn't
stay away, huh?

95
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,750
[MINORI] Oh, hey Tsukasa!

96
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,625
Whoa! We're getting a ride
from The General herself?

97
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,500
You eat a watermelon
on the train?

98
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,041
Wait...

99
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,125
Am I crazy or is the middle
child sporting a motherly glow?

100
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,375
Knock if off, Sis. Jeepers.

101
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,541
You're going to embarrass me
in front of everybody.

102
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,958
Don't be so self-conscious.
You look absolutely fabulous.

103
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,750
Thank you. [giggles]

104
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,625
You've filled out a
bit, too, Kousaku.

105
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,666
How're things?

106
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,958
Finer than frog hair
split four ways.

107
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,500
Frog hair?

108
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,250
Oh, country-folk jibber-jab.
Welcome to the sticks, Ringo.

109
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,791
This is how we do.
No standing on ceremony.

110
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,250
You'll be just fine.

111
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,875
How do you know my name?

112
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,791
Ha! We're all up in
everybody's business here.

113
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,916
Right. Load up and climb in!
Time's wasting, fam's waiting.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,416
Heh. Tiger gets shotgun.

115
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,458
Seriously?

116
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,500
Aunt Hisako, Uncle Kiichi.
What are we doing here again?

117
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,791
Exchanging engagement gifts!

118
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,833
Oh, yeah? Who's engaged?

119
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,333
Good one.
You and Minori, my boy!

120
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,375
[screams]

121
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,458
Sister. I thank you. My heart--

122
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,041
Miiinoooriii!!

123
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,250
Sorry, the jig is up! I get
why you dragged me out here!

124
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:02,166
Wakadana has a sixth sense, huh?
Oh-ho, motherly glow, eh?

125
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,625
You are absolutely
the worst kind of person!

126
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,416
[MINORI giggles] Darling,
please, save it for later!

127
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,083
No time like the
present for truth!

128
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,625
[MINORI screams]

129
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,208
[KIICHI] Minori!

130
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,666
[KIICHI yells]

131
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,875
[HISAKO]
What in heaven's name is that?!

132
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,625
[KOUSAKU]
It's a wallaby from school!

133
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,833
But she?

134
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,750
Young lady!
What is the meaning of this?

135
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:30,208
[wails] I caved
under the pressure

136
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,583
to give you
grandchildren, okay?!

137
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,416
[TSUKASA]
I see what you did there.

138
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,333
[TSUKASA] Let me give you
some sisterly advice, Hondo.

139
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,208
Next time you want us all
to think you're expecting

140
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,583
a visit from the stork, make
sure the proud papa-to-be

141
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,125
is in on the scam. You know
this is pathetic, right?

142
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,583
Yeah...

143
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,500
[WAKA squeaks]

144
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,500
Well, what I'd like to know
is how you all fell for it

145
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,833
in the first place!

146
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,416
I mean, how could you
possibly think me and her

147
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
were going to be parents?
How gullible can you be?

148
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,208
[KOUSAKU] Sorry!
Never mind about that!

149
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,958
The thing is, though...
What's the big rush?

150
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,625
--[TSUKASA] Kousaku.
--Ma'am?

151
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,333
Here's the deal. I'm getting
a non-profit off the ground.

152
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,250
This here town needs it.

153
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,625
Uh... Oh yeah?

154
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,458
We're calling it "Turn A!"

155
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,625
Do what now?

156
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,541
In city talk, coming
back to the country

157
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,875
is a U-turn, or,
sometimes, an I-turn.

158
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,125
But I'm thinking alpha.

159
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,333
A-turn is sort of clumsy
in practice, though.

160
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,333
So I "turned it around" and
there you have it:

161
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:31,208
coming back to your roots!
See, "A" also stands for Aioi!

162
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,708
[KOUSAKU groans]

163
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,333
Deal is, the town's about to put
on it's first full-fledged

164
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,416
Turn-A extravaganza.

165
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,041
I banked on you
two getting hitched

166
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,708
being the big draw
that brings in the crowds.

167
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,375
Huh? How so?

168
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,291
[ALL] A mixer?

169
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,625
You bet! Two hundred
upwardly mobile singles

170
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,500
mingling together over
country-fried hors d'oeuvres

171
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,875
right here in Aioi!

172
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:54,958
[BOTH] Hm!

173
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,000
And you two were
gonna be the big focus.

174
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,208
Young couple in love makes good
-our own farm-raised success!

175
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,041
Couple?

176
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:01,750
In love?

177
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,833
Whoaaa!

178
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,041
You first locked eyes in Aioi.

179
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:08,875
married in Aioi, live in Aioi,
work and play in Aioi,

180
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,291
and are about to be one baby
into rearing a family in Aioi.

181
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,541
You two'll be the ideal
PR centerpiece

182
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,833
for what this mixer's
meant to accomplish!

183
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:20,625
[chuckles, grunts]
I've got morning sickness.

184
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,041
[TSUKASA]
Here's the plan, chief:

185
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,458
you're going to get my sister
in a family way, pronto.

186
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,291
You're practically engaged as it
is, so what the hey, right?

187
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,375
Yes!

188
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,166
Come on, boy!
Think of the village!

189
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,375
The village!

190
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,708
This is crazy!
How am I supposed to just--?

191
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,208
Look, kid: we borrowed a lot
of dough to make this happen.

192
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,750
If the mixer gets called off,
we're a million in the hole.

193
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,833
In other words, I'd be happy to
help my community any way I can.

194
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,125
Yeah! Let's get
this party started!

195
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,291
[ALL] Yeah!

196
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,916
[TSUKASA]
We'll seal your engagement

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,166
at the community center!

198
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,583
--[KIICHI] Young couple!
--[HISAKO] Young love!

199
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,125
[TWINS cheer]

200
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,291
[MINORI]
This is gonna be great!

201
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,875
We're going to be
so friggin' happy!

202
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:07,708
[OLD FOLKS cooing, murmuring]

203
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,375
[KOUSAKU sighs]
Man, what a crazy day.

204
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,125
Um, where's Ringo?

205
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,083
I put her up in the guestroom.
Poor dear was exhausted.

206
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,500
I'll bet.

207
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,750
Guess today was a pretty
big shock to her system, too.

208
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,291
Don't worry, though.
I've got a bed ready for you.

209
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,541
[KOUSAKU] Yeah?

210
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,291
[HISAKO] Takes you back,
doesn't it? In you go!

211
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,333
Crap! [grunts]

212
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,791
[HISAKO] Sweet dreams,
future son-in-law!

213
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,291
[KOUSAKU] You locked the door?
What if I have to pee?

214
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,250
[MINORI giggles]
Memory lane, huh?

215
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,000
Remember back in the day
how you'd always wet the bed?

216
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,166
[KOUSAKU] Gee, thanks.

217
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,208
Damn. Should've known.
Towns like this...

218
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,500
There's nothing they
won't do to counteract

219
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,750
the declining birthrate!

220
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,833
I'm essentially breeding
stock to these people!

221
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,291
So, uh, you know...

222
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,250
I have kind of a suggestion
to make if you're open to it.

223
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,458
It's actually a swell idea.

224
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,250
Oh, yeah? Go on.

225
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,125
Well, uh... If you...
I mean, you and me...

226
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,375
Made, you know, like a baby...
My folks would get off our back.

227
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,000
So...?

228
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:27,583
What?

229
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,625
What?!

230
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,708
What?!!

231
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,208
[MINORI]
Just think about it for a sec.

232
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,458
They're really only rushing us

233
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,333
'cause there ain't
no babies around.

234
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,791
If we got started
making them one,

235
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,791
they'd change their tune
in a heartbeat, right?

236
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,833
[KOUSAKU] Yeah!
Not the problem! Forget it!

237
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,541
That is not a
viable solution, period!

238
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,416
Aw, c'mon, Kousaku!
You like kids, don't you?

239
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,958
Yeah? Don't be a grump.

240
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,000
Look at you.

241
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,583
You'd be a great dad
and you know it.

242
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,208
In fact, our kid'd probably
be your spitting image.

243
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,208
Wouldn't that be
super-duper cute?

244
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,708
You're... You're serious.

245
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,958
Of course I am.

246
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,833
Hey, remember when your
parents first brought you over?

247
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,416
We were little.

248
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,541
I can see it like
it was yesterday.

249
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,708
There you were,
hiding behind your mom and dad,

250
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,708
not looking up at me even once.

251
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,333
[KOUSAKU] What did
you expect? I was scared.

252
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,833
We'd just up and moved
on a whim.

253
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,750
I had no idea what was going on.

254
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,125
[MINORI] I know. It's just...

255
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,375
The expression on your face
always stuck with me,

256
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,625
kind of like you were halfway
between tears and a tantrum.

257
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,791
See, I knew right then that
I could never leave you alone.

258
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,916
--[KOUSAKU gasps]
--You need me.

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,333
Or someone, at least.
Might as well be me.

260
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,333
Thing is, I want
to be there for you.

261
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,750
Look... We... I...

262
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,750
[BOTH] Bubba!

--[TAKUMI] Bubba!
--[AKINA] Sissy!

264
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,000
We want to sleep here
with you tonight!

265
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,541
Uh... Sure! Why not? Eh?

266
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,541
Yeah! Cool beans!
We'll have a slumber party.

267
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,833
Just like the old days.

268
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,291
[TWINS] Yay!

269
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,166
[KOUSAKU yawns] Good morning.

270
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,750
[MINORI]
Good morning, my darling Koutan!

271
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,000
[MINORI, KOUSAKU] Back after
while, Tsukasa and me

272
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,791
are making arrangements
for the wedding.

273
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,708
[KOUSAKU] Your Loving Wife.

274
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,666
The-They're really going to go
through with this, aren't they?!

275
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,666
[RINGO] Morning.

276
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,000
[KOUSAKU gasps]
Oh, hey! Morning!

277
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,166
Did, uh, you sleep okay?

278
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,416
Where's the gang?

279
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,583
Huh? Oh. The day starts
super early on a farm.

280
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,375
Hey, uh.

281
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,291
What would you say to me
giving you a little tour?

282
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,750
[RINGO] Cool.

283
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,500
[RINGO] Everybody's so hard
at work already.

284
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,708
[KOUSAKU] If there's one hard
and fast rule in the country,

285
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,166
it's get your work in
while the weather's nice.

286
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,125
Uncle Kiichi lives by that.

287
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,666
He's always the first one up.

288
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,000
Also the last guy
to call it a day.

289
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,375
One of his prize-winning
tomatoes. Here, try a bite.

290
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,416
Good, right?

291
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,125
He uses a special technique
and everything.

292
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,791
Too bad he won't be able to pass
it down to future generations.

293
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,000
Wait. He can't?

294
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,125
[KOUSAKU sighs] Not a lot of
people left in rural places

295
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,250
like this. The old ways
have been on the down swing

296
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,916
for a while now.

297
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,916
[RINGO] I wonder...

298
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,333
What do you think came first,
the chicken or the egg?

299
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,583
Are people leaving 'cause
farming's not popular,

300
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,291
or is it the other way around?

301
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,375
Maybe farming's losing its
appeal for people

302
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,833
'cause so many farmers
are calling it quits?

303
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,333
[KOUSAKU gasps]

304
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,833
If there was a way to
make it all attractive again,

305
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,958
people would start moving back
out to the country in droves.

306
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,541
[KOUSAKU]
Make farming attractive.

307
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,875
That must be what
Tsukasa is trying to get at.

308
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,666
Can't really blame the girl
for trying, huh?

309
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,166
[MAYOR] You know
Kiichi's oldest daughter?

310
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,833
Well, just like that,
she's back,

311
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,291
stirring up all manner of
heaven only knows what.

312
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,416
That's the union chief
and the mayor.

313
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,916
[UNION CHIEF] Oh, I heard.

314
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,250
"The General" thinks she can
bring in a lot of new blood.

315
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,083
Like they won't pick up and
leave at first sign of trouble.

316
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,708
[MAYOR] Remember that
family came up from the city

317
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,375
once upon a time?
Hata, I think the name was?

318
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,166
[UNION CHIEF]
It'll be that all over again.

319
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,375
[MAYOR] What's the verdict
on Kiichi's girl?

320
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,875
[UNION CHIEF]
She abandoned ship once.

321
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,500
Stands to reason
she'll do it again.

322
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,375
Guarantee you her enthusiasm
won't survive the month.

323
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,083
Well now, if you ask me,
that's being right generous.

324
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,291
What did they mean
"it'll be that all over again?"

325
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,041
Kousaku, I want to
see your house.

326
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,750
I'm talking to you!

327
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,291
[KOUSAKU]
There's nothing to see.

328
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,250
[KOUSAKU] It's there,
it's just not a house anymore.

329
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,708
Wait, what?

330
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,125
What do you mean?

331
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,083
[KOUSAKU]
Can we not go there, please?

332
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,875
It's not a pleasant story.

333
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,541
Jerk.

334
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,666
Uh?

335
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,000
Jerk.

336
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,750
Huh?

337
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,416
So Minori would know
what you were talking about.

338
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,708
But you won't
"go there" with me?

339
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,541
It's totally unfair.

340
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,583
[KOUSAKU] My parents got the
farming bug when I was little.

341
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,625
Thought it was the
end all be all.

scrounge up money

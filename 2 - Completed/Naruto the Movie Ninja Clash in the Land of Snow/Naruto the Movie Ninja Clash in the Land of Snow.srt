00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,302
MAN: It’s over.

2
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,553
We have nowhere left to go.

3
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,597
This is it.

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,680
Our road ends here.

5
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:01,225
‐It was a foolish decision,
doomed from the start.

6
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,233
‐This is the end.

7
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,863
We must turn back.

8
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,114
‐There is a way.

9
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:10,897
Have faith.

10
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,779
I know that we will find it.

11
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,487
‐But, Princess‐‐

12
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,657
‐You mustn’t give up!

13
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,205
‐Princess.

14
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,040
‐[guffaws]

15
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:28,135
Princess Gale, this
is as far as you go!

16
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,095
Now, halt.

17
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,474
‐Don’t tell us, this
storm is your doing!

18
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,263
‐[snickers]

19
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,135
‐Behind you, Princess!

20
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,473
Look out!

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:39,970
‐Hah!

22
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,069
‐Give up, Princess!

23
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:56,915
Fall to your knees
and bow before me.

24
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,792
PRINCESS: I will never give up.

25
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,791
As long as I live, I
will gather my strength

26
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:08,285
and forge a path for
others to follow!

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,130
‐The princess!

28
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,592
‐Her Rainbow Chakra is ablaze!

29
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,682
‐My brothers, we must light
the flames of our chakra, too!

30
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,641
‐Right!

31
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,391
‐[inaudible].

32
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,652
‐Aaah!

33
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,364
Now!

34
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:33,857
‐Aaah!

35
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,828
[music playing]

36
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,337
‐[giggles]

37
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,389
All right!

38
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,223
Princess Gale, you rule!

39
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,308
Good sticks it to evil
once again! [laughs]

40
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,443
‐Hey!

41
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,349
What the heck do you think
you’re doing up there?

42
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,357
‐Hup, yike! [groans]

43
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,860
What’s the big idea?

44
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,192
‐Don’t play stupid with me.

45
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,779
You snuck in here
without paying,

46
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,492
you lousy little freeloader!

47
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,282
‐Wait, you’ve got it all wrong!

48
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,585
ere just getting
a little training in

49
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,291
while we watch the movie!

50
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,249
‐Training for what?

51
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,871
‐We have tickets.

52
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,538
‐Are you ninja from
the Leaf Village?

53
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,996
‐You bet we are!

54
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,706
You’re looking at
the next Hokage.

55
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,916
A super ninja, pal.

56
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,797
Oh, yeah, Naruto Uzumaki,
live and in the flesh!

57
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:42,854
[angry shouting]

58
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,891
‐Come, let’s push on.

59
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,815
Our fate lies
beyond the rainbow!

60
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,225
[angry shouting]

61
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,085
‐[sighs]

62
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,553
Kakashi Sensei is late.

63
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,934
‐So what else is new?

64
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,142
‐Aw, man, that
movie was so cool.

65
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,555
I don’t think I’ve ever been
so blown away in my life.

66
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,693
‐I don’t want to hear it!

67
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,190
You made such a
racket in there, we

68
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,151
didn’t get to see
the whole thing!

69
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,234
[sighs]

70
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,027
I wish we could’ve
stayed a little longer.

71
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,990
I could have watched
that handsome Omiji

72
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,532
who played Tsukekuro
all day long.

73
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,446
Oh, of course, he doesn’t
compare to you, Sasuke.

74
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,326
‐Man, I don’t know where you
got your taste in men, Sakura.

75
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,326
But it stinks.

76
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:50,787
‐Come again!

77
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,634
‐I’m sorry.

78
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,841
What was the question?

79
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,750
‐Humph!

80
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,958
‐[sighs]

81
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,306
I wonder if there’s
anyone like her out there.

82
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,729
I mean, where’s my
Princess Gale, you know?

83
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:15,649
If I could fight for a girl
like that, I’d be on cloud nine.

84
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,402
‐Whatever.

85
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,743
It was just a movie.

86
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,239
‐[sighs]

87
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,241
‐It’s funny.

88
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,322
I wonder why Kakashi
Sensei told us

89
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,947
we had to go see this
movie before he’d

90
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,754
give us our mission.

91
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,119
‐[gasps]

92
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:43,968
‐No way!

93
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,472
Was that the princess?

94
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:46,685
‐Ugh!

95
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,475
Agh!

96
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,399
[grunting]

97
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,362
‐Why, you!

98
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,128
‐Ugh!

99
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,899
‐Huh?

100
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:36,601
‐Rrrarh!

101
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,899
‐Heyah!

102
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,647
‐Don’t let her get away!

103
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,608
‐Not to worry, Princess Gale!

104
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,070
I could protect you!

105
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,077
‐Aah!

106
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,841
‐Get her!

107
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:05,845
‐Aah!

108
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,506
‐Ugh!

109
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:08,935
‐Stay on her!

110
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:09,602
Don’t move!

111
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,061
We got you now.

112
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,929
‐We’ve finally captured her.

113
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,766
‐Feisty one.

114
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,981
Ow!

115
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,352
‐[grunts]

116
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:18,898
‐Huh?

117
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,780
‐Who are you?

118
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:22,979
Huh?

119
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,109
Ugh!

120
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,904
MAN: Where did the princess go?

121
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,487
‐Oh!

122
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,364
‐Oh, captain?

123
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,238
[men gasping]

124
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,629
‐Aarh!

125
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,051
MAN: Oh, dear.

126
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,761
‐Huh?

127
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,222
Kakashi Sensei!

128
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,142
‐What are you guys doing?

129
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,142
‐Killing time.

130
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,653
‐Gee, huh, I’m really
sorry about this.

131
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,402
‐Huh?

132
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,284
‐This is the gentleman who
hired us for our mission today.

133
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,383
NARUTO: Are you hurt, Princess?

134
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,224
This is crazy!

135
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,136
So, like, you are the real
Princess Gale, aren’t you?

136
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,683
I don’t believe this!

137
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,137
I just saw your
movie, and it totally

138
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,607
blew me out of the water!

139
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,059
"I’ll never give up."

140
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,019
It was so awesome.

141
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:45,648
First, you had me cheering.

142
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,824
Then I was crying.

143
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,822
Aakk!

144
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,323
Ugh!

145
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,326
I mean, after seeing the
movie, the feeling just

146
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,587
started to well up
inside of me! [panting]

147
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,007
I’ll never give up either!

148
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,222
I’m going to work my butt off.

149
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,053
And one day, I’ll
be the next Hokage.

150
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,969
Oh, right, you
probably don’t know.

151
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,386
The Hokage is the
highest ranking ninja

152
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,854
in the Hidden Leaf
Village where I come from.

153
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,234
Hey, lady, you really know
how to handle a horse.

154
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,062
No wonder you’re the Land
of Fire’s number 1 actress.

155
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:25,938
Ha!

156
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:26,356
And I know talent when I see it!

157
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,580
Ngeeh.

158
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,501
Hey, lady, aren’t we
going a little fast?

159
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,456
Look out!

160
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,418
‐Ugh!

161
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,428
‐Huh?

162
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,930
‐Huh?

163
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,181
It’s Princess Gale!

164
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,181
‐Oh, wow!

165
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,262
It is her.

166
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,308
‐Princess Gale!

167
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,601
Princess Gale!

168
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,234
‐Oh, look, my name
isn’t Princess Gale, OK?

169
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,140
‐Yeah, that’s right!

170
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,229
You’re the actress
Yukie Fujikaze.

171
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:08,362
I’m your biggest fan!

172
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,941
Can I have your autograph?

173
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:10,936
‐Yeah, me, too!

174
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:11,317
‐Here, please!

175
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,954
orget it, guys.

176
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,161
I don’t do autographs.

177
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:15,661
‐Please.

178
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,372
‐Come on.

179
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,780
‐Hey, what about me?

180
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,080
Can I get one?

181
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,830
‐Please!

182
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,544
‐You’re a movie star!

183
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:21,951
Aw, come on!

184
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,250
Sign autograph!

185
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,791
‐Enough, already!

186
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,254
‐[groans]

187
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,633
‐I mean, come on!

188
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,669
What’s so special about
getting my autograph, huh?

189
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,706
You’re just going to
shove it in some drawer

190
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,508
and forget about it.

191
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,132
l it’s good for
is collecting dust.

192
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,100
They’re just a waste of time!

193
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,719
They’re useless!

194
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,516
What a joke!

195
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,482
‐Ugh, that was so rude.

196
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,402
Not like she is in
the movies, is she?

197
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,610
‐Her success went
right to her head.

198
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,283
KAKASHI: Our mission is to guard
Yukie Fujikaze, the actress

199
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,123
best known for her
role as Princess Gale.

200
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,279
‐Guard?

201
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:04,498
‐Well, maybe not guard
her so much as escort her.

202
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,872
‐The next Princess Gale
movie is the first one

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,790
that we’re shooting abroad.

204
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,087
And, uh, I don’t need to
tell you our leading lady

205
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,841
is a bit of a diva.

206
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,424
‐Sorry, uh, I do apologize.

207
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,797
‐I’ll tell you, these
Leaf Ninja are impressive.

208
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:22,006
Uh, they took care of those
stuntmen‐turned‐bodyguards

209
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,268
we hired was child’s play.

210
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,230
And those are some big fellows.

211
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,692
‐Oh, well, uh, thank you.

212
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,486
‐Oh, wow!

213
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,912
Look at those cliffs.

214
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:43,702
MAN: Uh, that’s the Rainbow
Glacier in the Land of Snow.

215
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,998
‐Hey, you played
the part of Buriken!

216
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,500
‐That’s where we’re all going to
shoot the scenes for the film’s

217
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,173
big climactic ending.

218
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,041
‐You’re Hidero!

219
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,289
You play Shishimaru!

220
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,338
‐Land of Snow?

221
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,382
Long way to go to shoot
some scene for a movie.

222
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,176
‐Yukie Fujikaze’s manager,
Sandayu, over here

223
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,550
recommended it.

224
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,968
Apparently, he tells
us this Rainbow Glacier

225
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,387
turns seven different colors
during the springtime.

226
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,557
‐No, that’s just an old legend.

227
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,066
The truth is, there isn’t any
spring in the Land of Snow.

228
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:13,569
‐What?

229
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,611
Not ever?

230
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,744
‐Does that mean it’s
winter all year long?

231
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,361
‐Mm‐hm.

232
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,945
You got it.

233
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,702
‐Kakashi, wasn’t it?

234
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,242
From what I hear, this
won’t be your first time

235
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:23,826
in the Land of Snow.

236
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,080
Is that true?

237
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,582
‐That was a long time ago.

238
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,747
MAN: They say that it’s
a very poor nation, too.

239
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,586
‐Huh!

‐You‐‐ you, Tsukekuro,
Omiji, you were great!

242
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,261
‐Actually, the story
is their former lord

243
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,265
had a thing for gadgets.

244
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,767
The guy squandered
everything the clan

245
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,768
had on mountains of
useless doodads and gizmos.

246
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,901
‐Yeah, well, I just hope
they’ve got central heating.

247
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,440
I’m not really all that
cut out for the cold.

248
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,444
‐Maybe you should run
for the hills, too.

249
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,396
Just like Yukie.

250
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,275
‐Oh, hey, come on, you guys.

251
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,282
That’s not even funny.

[men laughing]

253
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:07,081
‐So does that mean, Yukie‐‐ I
mean, she not always like this,

254
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,291
is she?

255
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,371
‐Hm.

256
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,325
‐Kind of, yeah.

257
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:16,127
Poor Yukie, huh, she wouldn’t
even know the meaning of words

258
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,462
like "dreams" or "aspirations."

259
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,299
DIRECTOR: But she’s never
been one to neglect her work.

260
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,297
I don’t know anything
about her personal life,

261
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,967
and I don’t need to.

262
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,057
As long as she’s giving her
all when the camera’s rolling,

263
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,522
I won’t have any complaints.

264
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,353
Say what you will, that
woman is a born actress.

265
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,149
ASST.

266
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,483
DIRECTOR: He’s right.

267
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,936
And anyway, she only
started running from the set

268
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,147
after she heard we were
going to the Land of Snow.

‐Naruto Uzumaki!

sure do smell nice.

Ow!

What the heck was that?

284
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,454

‐You freak.

287
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,028
I mean, you’ve
got to be kidding.

288
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,116
Who would want to go
to the Land of Snow?

I finally found
you, Princess Gale!

‐I told you, kid.

293
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,824
I’m not the princess
of anything, OK?

294
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,487
‐What?

295
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,035
You think I don’t know that!

296
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,158
Do you really think you could
trample all over a kid’s dreams

297
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,366
like this?

I don’t care how high and
mighty an actress you are!

299
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,003
I’ll never forgive you!

That’s a riot.

I can’t think of a worse
job than being an actor.

305
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:07,532
Only the lowest of the low would
want in on this profession.

307
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,699

309
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,657
It’s ridiculous.

It happens all the time, OK?

325
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,906
I mean, lead actresses
change from sequel to sequel.

326
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,780
Come on, directors change
every five minutes.

327

who can play Princess Gale
other than you‐‐ nobody!

this late in the game,

this business again.

of one little girl

are you awake?

368
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,744
‐Sandayu, could you
get me some water?

369
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,745
My head won’t stop spinning.

370
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,160
This is going to
sound crazy, but it

371
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,366
feels like the room is swaying.

372
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,707
‐Actually, it’s, uh,
not all that crazy.

373
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,752
‐Huh?

374
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,667
[running footsteps]

375
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,765
Huh!

376
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,591
You have got to be kidding me!

377
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,943
‐I don’t know.

378
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,232
I don’t think I can
deal with this lady.

379
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,146
‐What are you talking
about, Naruto?

380
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,106
You have to deal with it.

381
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,895
You’ve just sworn
to protect her.

382
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,567
Come on, this is an
important mission.

383
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,237
‐Mission?

384
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,955
KAKASHI: Yes, an A‐rank one.

385
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,946
‐This is an A‐rank mission?

386
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,039
‐I don’t really
think our babysitting

387
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,923
a little pampered actress
will be all that difficult.

388
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,960
‐That’s not true, Sasuke.

389
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,965
Big celebrities are
targeted all the time.

390
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:42,377
Besides, it’s hard to
predict who’s after them.

391
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,338
Just be on your guard.

392
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,519
‐Light is set.

393
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:48,971
‐OK, we have speed!

394
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,889
‐Camera is rolling.

395
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,936
‐All right, folks!

396
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,900
I want to get this
on the first take!

397
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,900
ALL: Right!

398
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,901
‐OK, scene 23, cut 6, take 1.

399
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,025
‐And action!

400
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:05,202
‐Oh.

401
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,664
‐Huh?

402
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,452
‐Shishimaru!

403
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,335
Stay with me!

404
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,711
‐Uhh, I’m sorry.

405
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,461
I failed you, Princess.

406
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,001
Forgive me, I beg you.

407
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,005
‐How can you say that?

408
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,796
Without you at
our side, we never

409
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,510
would have found the courage
we needed to make it this far.

410
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:29,813
‐I only wish I’d seen beyond
the rainbow with you, Princess.

411
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,520
Uhh.

412
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,812
‐Shishimaru!

413
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,644
‐Whoa.

414
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,098
‐She’s amazing!

415
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,358
‐I don’t even feel like I’m
looking at the same person

416
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:38,900
anymore.

417
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,694
‐Oh, yes.

418
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,238
That’s Yukie for you.

419
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,401
‐Huh?

420
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,159
‐When the camera starts
to roll, she comes alive.

421
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,870
There isn’t another
actress on earth

422
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,662
who can match her brilliance.

423
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:54,213
‐[sobs]

424
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,830
Hold on a second, guys.

425
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,416
[men groan]

426
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,593
‐What’s wrong?

427
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,051
‐Sandayu, bring me my
drops so I can cry.

428
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,710
‐Right, right.

429
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,709
Oh, coming, coming.

430
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,718
I have the drops, the drops.

431
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,380
OK.

432
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:05,877
Now, let’s see.

433
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,758
Uh, one there and‐‐

434
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:09,808
‐‐‐and now, the other one.

435
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,009
‐Ready?

436
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,598
‐Ugh, they’re spilling over.

437
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,065
Come on, let’s do this.

438
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,483
h, for Pete’s sake!

439
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:15,891
Start with the close‐up.

440
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,560
‐Right.

441
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,016
ASST.

442
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,145
DIRECTOR: OK.

443
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,941
Scene 23, cut 6, take 2.

444
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,146
Action!

445
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,114
YUKIE: Shishimaru!

446
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,906
ASST.

447
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,457
DIRECTOR: Mr. Makino,
we’ve got a problem!

448
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,180
‐What is that?

449
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,051
‐When I woke up this morning,
I found this waiting for me.

450
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:51,928
We can’t get through!

451
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,386
What are we going to do?

452
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,186
‐This is it!

453
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,729
We’re changing everything!

454
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,523
‐Ha‐aah?

455
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,686
‐You moron!

456
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,114
Look, we’re standing on
the perfect spot to shoot!

457
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,704
It’s practically
begging us to film here!

458
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,949
‐Uh, ha‐aah?

459
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,110
‐Cherish this moment.

460
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,199
The movie gods are
smiling down on us!

461
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:12,954
Everyone, prepare to embark!

462
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:13,907
MAN: All right, yeah.

463
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,504
Clear this up.

464
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,711
Clear the area.

465
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,499
WOMAN: Let’s try and get
some last looks in, people.

466
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,294
[both yawning]

467
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,457
ASST.

468
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,843
DIRECTOR: All right,
people, we’re going to roll.

469
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,002
Stand by!

470
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:28,339
‐OK, scene 36, cut 22.

471
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,797
Action!

472
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,135
‐[guffaws]

473
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,050
So, Princess, you’ve arrived!

474
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,058
Well done!

475
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,390
‐It’s you, Mao!

476
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,976
‐Princess, please, stay back!

477
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,443
‐We’ll take care of him for you.

478
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,272
‐Did you honestly believe
these meager fools

479
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,358
would be a match
for me, Princess?

480
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,525
[growls]

481
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,864
Huh?

482
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,989
Is this in the scene?

483
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,077
‐Hey!

484
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,989
What do you think you’re doing?

485
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:56,288
‐Everyone, get back!

486
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,672
‐Welcome, friends,
to the Land of Snow.

487
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,219
‐You!

488
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,296
‐Greetings, Princess Koyuki.

489
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:18,348
I do hope you’re still carrying
around the hex crystal.

490
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,595
‐[gasps]

491
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,645
Princess Koyuki?

492
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,648
Huh!

493
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,032
‐You’re as good as
they say, Kakashi.

494
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,913
Unfortunately, it’s
not good enough.

495
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:33,992
KAKASHI: Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura.

496
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:34,744
‐Huh?

497
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,827
‐You three protect Yukie.

498
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,661
Everyone, get back to the ship!

499
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:39,957
‐Wha‐‐

500
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,329
‐Huh?

501
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:45,255
‐Fubuki, Mizore, I’ll
leave the princess to you.

502
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,917
‐Very well, then.

503
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,926
‐It’s been a long time, Kakashi.

504
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:57,062
I hope you’re not planning
to run like the last time.

505
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,221
‐Nadare Roga.

506
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,075
‐I don’t know what’s
in the script,

507
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,447
but I’ve always wanted
to be in the movies!

508
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,124
Don’t you worry, Princess.

509
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,742
Naruto Uzumaki’s
here to save you!

510
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,684
‐Ice Style, Tsubame Blizzard!

511
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,440
‐Fire Style, Fireball Jutsu!

512
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,147
‐Huh!

513
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,034
‐Hurry!

514
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,779
Back to the ship, everyone!

515
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:53,863
Yukie!

516
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:54,356
‐Princess!

517
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,200
‐Sandayu, what are you‐‐

518
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,374
‐Ice Prison!

519
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,296
‐Aaah!

520
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,181
‐Naruto!

521
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,017
Water Style, Water Dragon Jutsu!

522
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,687
[growls]

523
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,317
‐Keep that camera rolling
even if it kills you!

524
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:37,073
Show the resolve of
the cinematographer!

525
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,316
‐Sensei!

526
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,368
There’s something strange
about their armor!

527
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,162
‐Yeah, I know.

528
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,543
Just be careful.

529
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,922
It’s Chakra Armor created by the
ninja here in the Land of Snow.

530
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,789
‐Chakra Armor?

531
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,876
‐But it’s definitely a lot
stronger than it used to be.

532
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,384
NADARE: So you remember.

533
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,466
The armor increases the
chakra within the body,

534
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,641
strengthening a handful
of the more useful jutsu.

535
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:04,391
A chakra barrier gathers
around us as well,

536
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,016
able to deflect the
chakra of our adversaries.

537
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:13,695
As a result, ninjutsu and
genjutsu are rendered useless.

538
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,687
‐[grunts]

539
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,317
‐Ice Style, Dragon versus Tiger!

‐Water Style, Water Dragon!

541
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,014
‐Out of the way, little girl!

542
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,510
Ugh!

543
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,007
You little brat!

544
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,021
MIZORE (VOICEOVER):
What is this chakra?

545
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,450
‐Ugh!

546
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,970
‐Yukie, hurry!

547
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,513
Get to the ship already!

548
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:26,426
‐Princess!

549
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,396
‐Father!

550
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,151
‐What are you doing?

551
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,615
Get out of here!

552
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,113
‐Princess, please, we
must get to the ship.

553
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,447
‐No.

554
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,490
‐You’ve got to go now!

555
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,664
Your life is‐‐

556
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,782
‐I don’t care if I die!

557
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,287
I won’t‐‐ I won’t come
back to the Land of Snow!

558
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,083
‐We don’t have
time for this, OK?

559
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:52,325
Ugh!

560
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,077
Aagh!

561
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,256
Sakura!

562
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,716
‐Princess!

563
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,557
‐Huh?

564
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,311
‐Don’t be in such a hurry.

565
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,313
We’re not finished yet.

566
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,517
‐Ice Style, White Whale Jutsu!

567
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,107
[whale call]

568
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,487
‐OK, that was impressive.

569
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,538
Now, it’s my turn.

570
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,331
Naruto, get everyone
out of here!

571
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:38,087
Ice Style, White Whale Jutsu!

572
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,840
‐Still copying my moves, huh?

573
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,301
You’re not going to
settle this by doing that.

574
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,552
‐Settle the fight?

575
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,386
That’s not really what I was
aiming for at the moment.

576
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,142
‐What?

577
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,018
[whale call]

578
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,569
‐And cut!

579
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,198
‐Man, I hope we got all of that.

580
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,562
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): 10 years.

581
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,812
It’s been a long time.

582
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,564
[door opens]

583
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,557
‐The ship pulled into
dock a moment ago.

584
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,503
KAKASHI: You’ve known all
along, Sandayu, haven’t you?

585
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,869
SANDAYU: Yes.

586
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,747
KAKASHI: Didn’t you
ever consider the risks

587
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:03,424
of what might happen if she
came back to the Land of Snow?

588
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,587
SANDAYU: You’re
right, of course.

589
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,764
But this was the
only way I could

590
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,093
think to get the
princess to return home.

591
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:10,548
‐[laughs]

592
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,887
Come on, Sandayu.

593
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,933
You don’t have to
keep calling her that.

594
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,476
I mean, she’s only royalty
on the big screen, right?

595
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,731
It’s not like she’s
really a princess.

596
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,363
SANDAYU: Actually, she is.

597
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,401
‐Huh?

598
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,033
‐Yukie Fujikaze
is only an alias.

599
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,611
We’re guarding Princess Koyuki
Kazahana, the rightful heir

600
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,408
to the Land of Snow’s throne.

601
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,451
[both gasp]

602
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,907
‐I first met her
a long time ago.

603
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:39,036
I was her aide when she was
still just a little girl.

604
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,424
I don’t blame her
for not remembering.

605
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,091
It was years ago.

606
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:47,300
‐So does that mean you are also
from the Land of Snow, Sandayu?

607
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,632
‐That’s right.

608
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,467
I served the princess’s
father, the former leader

609
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,603
of the clan, Lord
Sosetsu Kazahana.

610
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,636
The Land of Snow is
not a large nation,

611
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:03,898
but‐‐ but served as
a haven of peace.

612
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,652
Lord Sosetsu, he absolutely
adored the princess.

613
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,776
Ahh, those were idyllic times.

614
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:19,620
But 10 years ago, on that cursed
day, Lord Sosetsu’s younger

615
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,496
brother Doto hired a
group of Snow ninja

616
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,793
and instigated a revolt.

617
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,338
It was a coup d’etat.

618
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,681
The magnificent Kazahana
Castle burned to the ground.

619
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,852
And I feared the princess
had perished as well.

620
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,273
‐Keep your face hidden.

621
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,024
They could still find us!

622
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,703
SANDAYU (VOICEOVER): There was
no way we could defeat them.

623
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,659
We had to keep running.

624
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,490
We had to get away.

625
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,366
‐Father!

626
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,286
‐The day that I discovered
our beloved princess was still

627
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,044
alive, I was practically
beside myself with joy.

628
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,299
[sobs]

629
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,919
She was‐‐ she was alive
after all those years.

630
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,299
[sobs]

631
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,105
‐I should have died back then.

632
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,561
‐Huh?

633
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,889
‐[grunts]

634
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,686
‐You mustn’t say such
things, Princess.

635
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,060
We feared the worst.

636
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,606
You can’t imagine how
frantic we all were.

637
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,612
We never stopped
praying for your life.

638
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:33,203
PRINCESS: I’m alive,
but my heart is dead.

639
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,410
‐[gasps]

640
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,450
‐After that day, any tears
I had left all dried up.

641
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:48,207
‐And that’s how I came to be
the manager for Yukie Fujikaze.

642
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,765
I have bided my time
waiting for the day when

643
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,590
I could escort her
back to Land of Snow.

644
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:54,475
‐Uh!

645
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,973
So what are you saying then?

646
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,604
That all of this time
you’ve just been using us?

647
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:01,102
‐Uh, I apologize
for deceiving you.

648
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,854
But it was for the sake of
the Land of Snow’s people.

649
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:11,688
Princess Koyuki, confront Doto
and assume your rightful place

650
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,776
as the leader of our land!

651
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,655
I will sacrifice my
life without hesitation

652
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,163
in order to protect you.

653
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,415
I beg you!

654
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,294
Take up arms and
lead your people!

655
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,416
YUKIE: I don’t think so.

656
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,464
‐Huh?

657
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,207
‐You’ve got to be kidding.

658
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:37,138
‐But what about
what your people?

659
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,718
‐I couldn’t care
less about them.

660
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,723
Just forget it!

661
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,635
‐But, Princess.

662
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:44,485
‐Will you give it up already?

663
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,691
Don’t be dumb!

664
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,190
It doesn’t matter what you do.

665
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,152
You will never get
rid of Doto, OK?

666
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,151
‐[sobs]

667
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:53,694
‐So what?

668
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,778
He should just give up?

669
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,991
Quit being so heartless!

670
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,823
Can’t you see this poor man
has given his entire life

671
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,118
to the realization
of this dream?

672
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,832
You keep insulting
him like that,

673
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,623
and you’ll be dealing
with me, lady!

674
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,415
‐Naruto, I‐‐

675
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,750
‐Humph.

676
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,714
‐As long as there is
hope, one may dream.

677
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:17,507
And with those dreams,
the future comes.

678
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,972
I like it.

679
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,722
It’s the perfect theme for
our new Princess Gale movie.

680
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,845
‐Uh!

681
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,640
‐But, Mr. Makino,
you’re not really

682
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,063
going to continue filming with
everything that’s happened,

683
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,095
are you?

684
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:28,846
‐I told you.

685
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:29,767
The movie is evolving.

686
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,814
‐[gasps]

687
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,358
‐Just think about it.

688
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,992
How often do you get
the chance to make

689
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,859
a movie with a real princess?

690
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,656
We’re looking at the
chance of a lifetime here.

691
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,490
‐You’re right.

692
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,695
Think of the buzz.

693
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,037
Even the "Making
of" will be a hit!

694
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,251
We’re sitting on a
surefire blockbuster!

695
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,634
‐Hey!

696
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,919
KAKASHI: Unfortunately, there’s
only one course of action.

697
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,974
Now that Doto is on her trail,
running isn’t an option.

698
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,929
We have to fight.

699
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,261
It’s our only chance of
getting through this.

‐OK!

703
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Time to continue the mission!

704
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,146
The princess returns
to the Land of Snow

705
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,859
and shows that
creep who is boss!

706

YUKIE: Stop joking around!

707
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,192
‐Huh?

708
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,695
‐The movies aren’t
like real life.

709
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:21,026
There is no such thing as a
happy ending in this world!

710
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,034
‐Of course, there is!

711
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,085
If you’re willing
to fight for it!

712
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,239
‐Uh!

713
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,406
‐Normally, under
these circumstances,

714
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,407
I’d head back to the village
for a little bit of help.

715

We’re as fine as we can be.

718
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,632

‐Hm?

727
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,634
SANDAYU: Our hideout
is not far from here.

728
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,713
It’s just beyond this cave.

729
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,258
Once we’ve finished
our shooting here,

730
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,261
we’ll pass through
to the other side.

731
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,894
Then my people can rest easier.

732
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,970
They’ll finally have
their princess back.

733
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,033
NARUTO: Boy, I can’t
see the exit at all.

734
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,362
‐Once upon a time, a
railroad ran through here.

735
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,570
‐Railroad?

736
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,368
‐It’s covered over with
pillars of ice by now.

737
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,374
But dig far enough
down, and you’ll

738
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,875
find the tracks
laying there still.

739
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,617
‐Ahh.

740
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:06,256
‐All right, people, let’s
get this show on the road.

741
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,354
‐Ugh, Mr. Makino, we’ve
got a bit of a problem.

742
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,720
‐What is it now?

743
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,639
‐Yukie has up and
vanished again!

744
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,885
‐What?

745
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,848

YUKIE (VOICEOVER): Forget it.

748
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,935
Absolutely not.

749
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,658
‐Fan out and look for her.

750
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,409
Radio in if she turns up.

751
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,373

Aah!

755
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,054
Ugh!

756
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,275
SOSETSU (VOICEOVER): If you look
closely, you’ll see the future.

757
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,910
‐I can’t see anything.

758
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,078
‐Of course, you can.

759
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,337
When the spring comes, you will.

760
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,210
‐The spring?

761
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,087
YUKIE (VOICEOVER):
You’re a liar, Father.

762
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,346
There is no spring in this land.

[rustling]

764
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,938
‐Jeez, how many
times are you going

765
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,238
to run away from your fate?

766
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,450
Come on, everyone’s waiting.

767
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,332
‐Why?

768
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,800
Why do you always
come looking for me?

769
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,052
‐Because it’s my mission.

770
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,301
It doesn’t matter
how much you hate it,

771
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,264
I’ll keep coming after you.

772
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,683
Just try to hide.

773
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,308
I’m going to find you.

774
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,781
‐You can drag me back if you
like, but all I’m going to do

775
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,319
is act for the camera.

776
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,363
And that’s it, you got me?

777
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,819
‐Hah!

[crowd gasping]

781
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,962
‐What is that?

782
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,508
‐Huh?

783
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,676
It’s chakra.

784
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:59,524
There’s chakra running through
the rails, melting the ice.

[gasps]

786
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:01,314
It must be him.

Everyone hurry!

788
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,775
You must get out of here!

789
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:08,109
You can’t let them find you!

790
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,822
’s not safe!

791
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,692
‐Sandayu?

792
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,858

‐[panting]

794
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,961
‐It’s a train.

‐Train?

796
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,044
What do you mean a train?

798
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:32,216
‐Oh, that train!

799
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,391
‐It’s gaining on us!

800
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:43,057
‐Not, if I can help it!

801
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,064
‐We’ll never make it!

802
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,065
‐I’m not giving up, lady!

803
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:48,399
‐There’s no way you can do this!

804
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,193
‐Will you just shut up already?

805
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:56,908
‐Ah!

806
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,081
Uh, this is going
to be pointless!

807
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:58,989
Just give up!

00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,737

I’m going to give up,

even if you’re ready to call it
quits, I’m not giving up ever!

Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

It’s Doto.

‐It’s been 10 years.

824
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,567
Come now, don’t be shy.

825
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,440
Let’s get a look at that face.

826
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:21,453
Hm.

‐There you have it, men!

Our beloved Princess Koyuki
is here to watch over us!

With her at our side,
victory is ours!

‐Hear me, Doto.

We’ve waited a long time for
this day of reckoning to come.

Sandayu Asama and
50 loyal warriors

We’ll get rid of
them immediately.

‐No.

With men such as
these, there is little

that they can understand
other than total annihilation.

comes of never giving up.

If they hadn’t stood up to Doto,
then none of this bloodshed

we are able to keep believing
in spite of everything

864
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:24,572
because we knew you are alive.

865
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:29,163
When you were little,
uhh, and even now,

866

you have always been‐‐ [groans]

Sandayu, believed, so, too, must

you believe in yourself.

You have always been our
purest hope, Princess.

Please do not waste
your tears on me.

Ahh.

‐You are such a fool, Sandayu.

873
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,145
I can’t cry.

874

You have my eye drops.

Are you all satisfied?

00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,664
Let’s go back.

If you stay here, your
lives will be in jeopardy.

only one with the power

00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:03,603
‐Yes.

907
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,187
‐Good.

908
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,611
It is the sole remaining
link to the Kazahana Clan

909
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:13,782
and the key to
opening its treasure.

910
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,664
‐The key to what?

911
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:20,869
‐When I wrested this land
from your father’s hands,

912
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:24,793
the Kazahana Clan’s
resources were all but gone.

913
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:28,455
I knew Sosetsu must have
hidden his riches somewhere.

914
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:35,086
I searched for a long time,
and finally, I found it.

915
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,637
It is hidden deep within
the Rainbow Glacier.

916
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,642
There’s a keyhole
there which can only

917
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,814
be opened by the hex crystal.

918
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,225
Once I have possession
over the Kazahana fortune,

919
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:51,734
our country can attain
military superiority

920
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,897
over the five great nations!

921
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,446
NARUTO: Not going to happen!

922
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,909
‐[gasps]

923
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,030
You!

924
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,157
‐How on earth did
you get in here?

925
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:06,996
‐Heh, never
underestimate a ninja!

926
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,924
[gasps]

927
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:11,463
Ugh!

928
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,338
‐My apologies.

929
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,640
As you can see, the little
runt was kind of a handful.

930
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:26,485
‐Well, he knows the
Multi Shadow Clone jutsu.

931
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,150
‐I’ll tell you, I don’t
know who this brat is,

932
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,439
but his level of chakra
is nothing to sniff at.

933
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,484
‐What do you think?

934
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,567
Maybe we should try that
contraption out on him?

935
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:37,864
‐Hm.

936
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,068
He would make for an
interesting test subject.

937
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,331
[zapping]

938
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:52,789
‐Ugh!

939
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,472
Aargh!

940
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:58,880
Agh!

941
00:52:59,009 --> 00:52:59,839
‐What is that?

942
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,968
‐We’re cleansing
him of his chakra.

943
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:04,224
That device will
absorb any that’s

944
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:07,638
stored in his body and bind
it within a powerful barrier.

945
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,766
Once it’s been activated, it
cannot be broken or destroyed,

946
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:12,855
no matter what.

947
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,859
‐My strength, it’s
starting to slip away.

948
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:26,244
‐Not looking like much of
a ninja anymore, are you?

949
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,500
Just a little kid.

950
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,207
‐You dirty‐‐ ugh.

951
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:40,010
‐Now then, I’ll take the hex
crystal, if you don’t mind.

952
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:53,984
‐Oh.

953
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:58,855
Hm?

954
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:03,414
What is this?

955
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:03,910
‐Ugh!

956
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,082
‐This isn’t a game!

957
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,869
Do you think I don’t
know this is a fake?

958
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,753
‐No, that’s impossible!

959
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,412
[gasps]

960
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,248
Kakashi Hatake.

961
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,746
‐What?

962
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,130
‐Makes sense.

963
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,626
Kakashi’s a shrewd one.

964
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,178
I wouldn’t put it past him
to pull a bait‐and‐switch.

965
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,720
‐Don’t even worry about it.

966
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,063
We’ll have him
rounded up in no time.

967
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,679
DOTO: That won’t be necessary.

968
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:29,636
‐Huh?

969
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,597
‐Ugh!

970
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,936
‐Why even bother.

971
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:37,111
The man will show up
on his own soon enough.

972
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:40,322
Until then, we
just have to wait.

973
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,994
[chuckles]

974
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,163

Uh!

[gasps]

982
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:11,468
Terrific.

983
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,058
I don’t have any power.

984
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,653
Guess I should have spent
a little more time working

985
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,861
on the Escape Jutsu.

986
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,981
[grunts]

987
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,746
These guys don’t know
who they’re dealing with.

988
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:41,465
A real ninja finds a way,
with or without his chakra.

[gate opens]

990
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,510

‐Serves you right.

994
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:18,715
‐Yeah?

995
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,292
You, too.

996
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,877
‐I know.

997
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:26,053
NARUTO: "No spring."

998
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,843
You said there was no spring.

999
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,137
What did you mean?

1000
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,890
‐"You’ll see when
spring comes, Koyuki,"

1001
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,939
my father used to say that.

1002
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,733
YOUNG KOYUKI: Father,
what is spring?

1003
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,399
SOSETSU: Oh, that’s right.

1004
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,315
You’ve never felt
spring, have you, Koyuki?

1005
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,945
‐Mm‐mm.

1006
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:54,993
SOSETSU: Koyuki,
close your eyes.

1007
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,208
Try to imagine yourself
surround with flowers.

1008
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,090
There now, isn’t it beautiful?

1009
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:07,762
Now, run through it
as fast as you can.

1010
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,564
Well?

1011
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,021
It makes you feel all warm
and happy, doesn’t it?

1012
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,061
‐Mm‐hm.

1013
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,265
‐That is spring.

1014
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:27,028
And if you never give up, if
you believe in the future,

1015
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,360
then spring is sure to come.

1016
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:36,875
‐But this land has no spring.

1017
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,964
My father died.

1018
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:40,751
I fled from the Land of Snow.

1019
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,172
And I stopped believing.

1020
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,423
I was always running,
always lying to people.

1021
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,805
But mostly, I was
just lying to myself.

1022
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,143
My life has been
one big charade.

1023
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,811
Becoming an actress was
about the only thing

1024
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,269
I was cut out for in this world.

Aah!

‐Told you.

1031
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,187
In the end, all you
can do is give up.

1032
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:52,236
‐[sighs]

1033
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,202
I bet it’s a lot easier
once you’ve given up.

1034
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,957
No one ever cared
about me before.

1035
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,209
And I just try to
blow it off, you know.

1036
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:08,501
But it was still pretty rough.

1037
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:12,587
I used to think there was no
place in this world for me.

1038
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:16,836

But I still found friends.

1042

I kept at it and didn’t give up.

1043
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:33,114
And good things happened.

1044
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,776
Aagh!

1045
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:41,736
When you give up your dreams and
everything else, they’re gone!

01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,188
didn’t you?

1088
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:11,979
‐Yeah.

1089
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,402
I apologize for that.

1090
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:15,522
But I figured this
was what he was after.

1091
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:23,243
‐All for this thing, huh?

1092
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:24,825
[guard yells]

1093
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,278
‐This place is
crawling with guards!

1094
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,289
‐Sakura!

1095
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,200
Sasuke!

1096
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:29,907
‐This way.

‐Doto!

1100
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,320
‐Well done, Koyuki.

1101
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,020
‐Wha‐‐

1102
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:58,938
‐[gasps]

1103
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,029
‐Wait!

1104
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:05,575
It can’t be.

1105
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,833
‐This shouldn’t be a
surprise to any of you.

1106
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,287
I mean, really, I’m
an actress, aren’t I?

1107
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,707
DOTO: There you have it.

1108
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,964
Another brilliant performance
by the great Yukie Fujikaze.

1109
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:32,681
‐Yes, it was all an act.

1110
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:33,639
Ugh!

‐[grunts]

1112
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,357
‐I told you, didn’t I?

1113
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,310
I’m an actress!

1114
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:39,898
Uh!

1115
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,653
‐You wretched‐‐

1116
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:41,976
‐Aagh!

1117
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:42,860
‐Princess!

1118
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:48,736
‐Uhh, I always knew,
Naruto, that if I

1119
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:53,325
ever return to this country,
I was going to die here.

1120
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,833
At least, I could‐‐

1121
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,455
‐[growls]

1122
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,963
‐Don’t you do it!

1123
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:02,005
Don’t you stop fighting!

1124
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:06,008
‐Naruto, it’s only
thanks to you that I

1125
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:10,262
could stop running
away here at the end.

1126
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,467
‐No!

1127
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,766
Because all you’re
doing is running away!

1128
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,060
Don’t throw away
your life like this!

1129
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,517
‐I’m sorry, Father, Sandayu.

1130
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:32,663
‐Koyuki!

1131
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:40,127
Aagh!

1132
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,550
‐[chuckles]

1133
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,590
You really thought
you could kill me,

1134
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:48,054
did you with this little toy?

1135
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,434
Humph.

1136
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,642
[clinks]

1137
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,886
‐That’s right.

1138
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,399
It’s Chakra Armor,
our latest prototype.

1139
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:01,402
‐Uhh.

1140
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:06,071
[coughs]

1141
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:09,454
‐Don’t you touch her with
those filthy hands of yours!

1142
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,952
Ugh!

‐Naruto!

1144
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,871
‐You’re wasting your time.

1145
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:19,625
Every ounce of your chakra has
been completely sealed away.

1146
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,205
Come, let us go, Koyuki,
beyond the rainbow.

1147
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:31,587
‐No!

1148
01:05:58,913 --> 01:05:59,293
‐Naruto!

1149
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,245
[crash]

1150
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,207

This ain’t over.

1155
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,306
I’m not going to go!

1156
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,108
Do you hear me?

1157
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,742
[gasping]

1158
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,819
You could run, but
you can’t hide.

1159
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:35,165
I’ll follow you as
long as I have to.

1160
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:38,161
Rrrharrh!

1161
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:38,786
[motor noises]

1162
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,120
Huh?

1163
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:47,286
‐Hop on!

1164
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:47,798
‐Huh.

1165
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,852
‐This is it.

1166
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,814
We’ve come here
after all, I guess.

1167
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,595
‐Sakura, how close are they?

1168
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:36,718
‐Hold on a sec.

1169
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,100
I’ve got it!

1170
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,977
20 degrees left in 5
seconds, 30 meters out.

1171
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,113
You want to aim for that branch!

1172
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,652
‐Right!

1173
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,193
‐Give it up.

1174
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:53,067
It’s useless.

1175
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,952
Come on, don’t make me laugh.

1176
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:16,339
‐Sakura Blizzard Jutsu!

1177
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:16,836
Enjoy!

1178
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,229
‐You’re dealing with a
ninja of the snow here.

1179
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:30,614
It will take more than
that to bring us down.

1180
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:32,532
‐You’re probably right.

1181
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,189
‐Uh!

‐What just happened?

1187
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:56,918
‐Gosh, I’m not really sure.

1188
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,048
Wait, you don’t
think that they‐‐

1189
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:07,889
‐You really think
you’ve got a shot?

1190
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,937
Maybe you ought to turn tail
and run, like the last time.

1191
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:13,363
‐I don’t have a choice, do I?

1192
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:16,153
At least, I could show you
one of my original techniques.

1193

[growls]

1198
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:39,838
Almost had me there.

1199
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,724
What?

1200
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,767
‐Even without
ninjutsu and genjutsu,

1201
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,769
a ninja always has taijutsu!

1202
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:50,852
You rely too much on this armor!

1203
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,842
‐I don’t see it.

1204
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,379
The treasure, where is it?

1205
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,597
‐It’s so warm.

1206
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,848
What is this?

1207
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,938
‐A heat generator?

1208
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,815
This is the hidden treasure
of the Kazahana Clan?

1209
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:39,781

hardly felt a thing there?

‐Naruto, that’s enough!

If you don’t stop,
he’s going to kill you!

NARUTO: Trust me.

If you just have a little
faith in me, I promise you,

1221
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,207
I won’t lose!

1222
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,472
‐How the‐‐ is it‐‐
is it possible

1223
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,814
that the chakra is
leaking out somehow?

1224
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,313
Hrrrh.

‐Hah!

01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,016
Did you really think
your pitiful little jutsu

1232
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,362
would have an effect on me?

1233
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:43,108
‐Naruto, his armor
has been fractured.

1234
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:48,662
The rest is up to you.

You are by far the strongest

01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,592
What the‐‐

1269
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:50,632
‐Wait a minute.

1270
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:54,173
Could this be‐‐ we’re
making this movie 3D!

1271
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,217
SOSETSU: Believe in the future.

1272
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:05,687
If you do, the spring
will surely come.

1273
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:09,690
What will you do when
it comes, Koyuki?

1274
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:13,074
YOUNG KOYUKI: I’m going
to become a princess.

1275
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:15,074
SOSETSU: Oh?

1276
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:16,744
What sort of princess?

1277
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,244
‐Um, let’s see.

1278
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:23,414
One who is strong
and who is kind,

1279
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:26,916
and most of all, one
who fights for justice.

1280
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:29,249
SOSETSU: [laughs]

1281
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,166
That’s some dream.

1282
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:35,593
‐Did I‐‐ did I actually
say those things?

1283
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:38,586
SOSETSU: Well, so long as
you believe in your dream

1284
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:42,757
and never give up, one day,
you’ll be that princess.

1285
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,651
You can see it, can’t you?

1286
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:57,647
There’s a beautiful princess
standing right there

1287
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,610
in front of you.

1288
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:14,667
YOUNG KOYUKI: But I
have sort of a problem.

1289
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,047
There’s something
else I want to be.

1290
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,972
‐Really?

1291
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,130
What’s that?

1292
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,600
‐An actress.

1293
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:22,639
SOSETSU: What?

1294
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:25,023
[laughs]

1295
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,311
‐[laughs]

1296
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,187
‐[laughs]

1297
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,855
Oh, yeah.

1298
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,654
Now, that’s a happy ending.

1299
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:37,647
[sighs]

1300
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:13,314
THEME SONG: Oh, whoa,
oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1301
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:18,857
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1302
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:23,906
Force of nature,
unrelenting, can never fall!

1303
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:25,913
And it’s supersonic!

1304
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,875
It will charge!

1305
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:29,205
Invincible!

1306
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:31,418
Here we go!

1307
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:36,840
There’s always something
steering the path I lead.

1308
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:42,881
There’s always someone ticking
and kicking inside of me.

1309
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:47,848
I‐‐ I will never give up!

1310
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:53,272
I‐‐ I will never give up!

1311
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:59,525
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1312
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:05,570
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1313
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:11,158
Ever changing and
evolving, life renewed.

1314
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:15,917
From a fire, flies
a phoenix born into.

1315
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:18,003
Here we go!

1316
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:23,297
The days of darkness,
trawling the battlefields.

1317
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:29,055
Remember your true friend, call
on and put your trust in me.

1318
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:34,479
I‐‐ I will never give up.

1319
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:40,403
I‐‐ I will never give up,
will never give up, yeah.

1320
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,954
Like a hurricane,
like a hurricane.

1321
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:46,281
Like jerks.

1322
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:49,947
Hurricane, like a hurricane.

1323
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:51,287
Lightning strikes.

1324
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,950
In like a hurricane.

1325
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,456
In like a hurricane.

1326
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:10,468
In like a hurricane.

1327
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:55,675
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1328
01:20:55,809 --> 01:21:00,359
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1329
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:02,399
Oh, whoa, oh‐‐

1330
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,694
YUKIE: That
generator wasn’t even

1331
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,989
fully developed in the end.

1332
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:11,032
SAKURA: I guess it will be
back to winter soon, huh?

1333
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:12,116
YUKIE: Not really.

1334
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,411
If we take what we know
and continue researching,

1335
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,246
before you know it,
the Land of Snow

1336
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:20,133
will be called the
Land of Spring.

1337
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:23,129
‐Yeah, but it’s kind of a shame.

1338
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,382
You’re such a big star.

1339
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,805
Are you really going
to retire from acting?

1340
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:27,342
YUKIE: Who said I was retiring?

1341
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:29,894
BOTH: Huh?

1342
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:32,468
‐Ruling over the Land
of Snow and acting?

1343
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,894
I think I can handle both.

1344
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:38,305
I mean, I’d have to be out
of my mind to give it up now.

1345
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:40,354
‐Uh, that’s great.

1346
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,687
‐Well, I’ll be seeing you.

1347
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:46,398
‐That’s her!

1348
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:47,115
‐There she is!

1349
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,156
‐Princess, sign here!

1350
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:50,779
‐Sure!

1351
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:51,526
‐Can I have your autograph?

1352
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:52,445
‐Would you please sign‐‐

1353
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,494
KAKASHI: That is great.

1354
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:58,035
She’s perfect.

1355
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,922
‐Aaagh!

1356
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:00,958
I’m so stupid.

1357
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,633
I should have
gotten an autograph!

1358
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,381
‐Don’t worry, I took care of it.

1359
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:05,842
TEAM: Huh?

1360
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,260
‐Whoa.

1361
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:18,266
Aagh!

1362
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:20,642
Oh, man, look at me.

1363
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,189
Couldn’t you, at
least, have used

1364
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:25,111
a better picture or something?

1365
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:25,610
Haay.

1366
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:33,624
DIRECTOR: And cut!

1367
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:34,619
That’s a wrap.

1368
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,160
ASSISTANT: Good stuff people!

1369
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:37,455
Thanks a million.

1370
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:38,618
Hey, let’s do lunch, seriously.

1371
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:40,464
Nice working with you, buddy.

1372
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:41,621
DIRECTOR: Isn’t that wonderful?

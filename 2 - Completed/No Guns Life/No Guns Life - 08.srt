1
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,513
[OLIVIER'S DAD]
Congratulations.

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,766
You're at the top of the
academy's incoming class.

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,728
I'll get you whatever you
want to celebrate the occasion

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,106
as soon as I come back
home, okay, Olivier?

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,401
Will you finally quit the force
like I've been asking you to?

6
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,238
What made you decide to enlist

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,698
with the military police
of all things anyway?

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,158
Isn't work already hard enough

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,370
without constantly making
enemies while you're on the job?

10
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,581
Come on, Olivier. Stop worrying.

11
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,042
You really are
just like your mom.

12
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,712
[OLIVIER'S DAD]
I'm heading to Norse Scott.

13
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:50,008
Just for some on‐site inspection
of augmentation technology.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,802
We're following up on a report

15
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,888
that they've been
abusing the prisoners there.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,849
Several officers were
sent out on reconnaissance,

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,519
but we haven't
heard from them since.

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,855
[gasps]

19
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,775
Well, someone has to take
care of business, don't they?

20
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,570
That's how it is.
You understand.

21
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,654
Then I have no choice

22
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,073
but to climb up the ranks
till I reach the top.

23
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:16,577
And then fire you
as soon as I can.

24
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,079
[chuckles]

25
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:22,874
But until I do, make sure
you stay in one piece.

26
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:28,297
Gotcha, Princess. I promise.

27
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,800
You know, Norse Scott is famous
for their tinned delicacies.

28
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,385
How 'bout I bring some home?

29
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,386
They're canned?

30
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,638
Yeah, and amazing, too.

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,100
You have no idea.
Just you wait and see, Olivier.

32
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:49,067
Hey, kid. It's Tetsuro, right?

33
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,945
Why don't you go ahead and
put that thing down already?

34
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,741
[OLIVIER] One of my
former subordinates called in.

35
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:00,412
They made contact with Gondry
at the End of War Memorial Park.

36
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,206
Juzo should be in that area.

37
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,168
He's totally screwed unless
we get his cigarettes to him.

38
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,003
And believe me, if he goes down,

39
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,464
it's gonna be
a problem for me, too.

40
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,053
[OLIVIER gasps]

41
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,388
[TETSURO groans]

42
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,349
[TETSURO]
That explosion.

43
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,934
‐‐[TETSURO] It's him!
‐‐[doors closing]

44
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,069
[JUZO]
You're sure about this?

45
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,945
It's what you really want?

46
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,803
[TOKISADA] You wield such
power despite your injuries.

47
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,346
I'm impressed.

48
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,266
Not bad,
my hammer‐headed friend.

49
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,393
[JUZO groans]

50
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,020
[TOKISADA]
Hmm, what's this?

51
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,901
[TOKISADA]
Hand‐rolled. How rare.

52
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,987
Unlike your beloved
Tanegashima brand,

53
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,615
this is made with
high quality materials.

54
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,450
Considering the
extraordinary amount

55
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,994
of cigarettes
you've burned through,

56
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:50,624
I'm quite certain your
nerves must be completely shot.

57
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,669
What's more, too many
firefights have left you spent.

58
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:59,216
You're merely spinning
an empty cylinder.

59
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,427
[JUZO] That's enough,
you slick son of a gun.

60
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,846
What's the game
you're playing at here?

61
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,517
[TOKISADA] Let me help
you gauge the situation.

62
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,103
This is the truth I've
been fighting to protect.

63
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,484
[TOKISADA]
During the Great War,

64
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,987
the members of Tindalos proudly
sacrificed their own bodies

65
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,533
in the name of
scientific progress.

66
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,911
To protect our
families, our homeland,

67
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,456
we led this country to victory.

68
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,083
And yet...

69
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,214
[TOKISADA]
In the end,

70
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:43,009
we sacrificed our dignity
to the war as well.

71
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,557
[TOKISADA]
For their sake,

72
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,269
I must go on as
a symbol of their heroism.

73
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,938
[TOKISADA chuckles]

74
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,148
[JUZO]
Uh?

75
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:03,780
[TOKISADA] That is my cause,
my duty, my cornerstone!

76
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,324
[JUZO]
I'm still drawing a blank here.

77
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,202
[TOKISADA]
Are you, now?

78
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,579
[JUZO groans]

79
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,542
[TOKISADA]
Listen closely.

80
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,462
Professor Wachowski was the
father of extension technology.

81
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,340
Using research from
experiments on Tindalos,

82
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,926
he worked closely
with Beruhren Corp.

83
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:29,472
They created your war‐type
model, the Gun Slave Unit.

84
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,891
Unfortunately,

85
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,977
their enormous power came
at the cost of their minds.

86
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,645
And thus,
all existing models were

87
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,315
decommissioned before
the end of the war.

88
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,527
To think I would ever come face
to... barrel with one like this.

89
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,404
[JUZO choking]

90
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,781
[TOKISADA] All your
actions were far too reckless

91
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,117
to be considered
strategically sound.

92
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,954
It was almost as if you were
trying to prove your worth.

93
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,959
[TOKISADA] In this country,
there are countless

94
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,128
disenfranchised
soldiers like you

95
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,464
who've been unable
to fit into society

96
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,050
after returning
home from the war.

97
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,179
How about it, my wayward friend?
Why not work with me?

98
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,767
Together we can make this world
a better place for the Extended!

99
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,643
[JUZO groans]

100
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,685
[TOKISADA gasps]

101
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,731
[JUZO] Hey. That sounds
like a noble idea,

102
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,400
but you mind gettin'
me some more smokes?

103
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,694
That was my last one.

104
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,490
[TOKISADA]
How unfortunate.

105
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,158
‐‐[JUZO groans]
‐‐[TOKISADA grunts]

106
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,339
[TOKISADA]
And there goes your last breath.

107
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,591
Rest your weary soul,

108
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,095
for I shall bear it
and carry you with me.

109
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,568
[TOKISADA] I won't ask
for your forgiveness, Gondry.

110
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,112
Once more, it seems

111
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,657
you must sacrifice
yourself to the greater good.

112
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,370
[TOKISADA] I'll be merciful.
You won't feel a thing.

113
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,871
[gunshot]

114
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,632
[TOKISADA]
How pitiful.

115
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,635
To unleash the power to
change the outcome of battle,

116
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,847
Gun Slave Units need to
be partnered with marksmen,

117
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,974
also known as Hands.

118
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,394
If only we'd been able
to come to an agreement.

119
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,023
Never mind. Such thoughts
are pointless now.

120
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,322
[VOICE A]
Surrender.

121
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,492
Entrust yourself completely.

122
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,870
Relinquish your muzzle.

123
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,914
Submit your trigger.

124
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:05,545
From now on, your blood and
your flesh are a living weapon.

125
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,380
You will destroy all enemies

126
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,051
and anyone else who would
endanger our country!

127
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,636
Feel it. Seize it.

128
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,513
Be proud!

129
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:20,727
This is the exhilaration
of protecting your homeland.

130
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,064

[TOKISADA]
I see. This must be it‐‐

his true form.

142
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,700

[TOKISADA laughing]

148
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,010
[TOKISADA] It doesn't matter
how powerful a weapon is

149
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,264
if the proper hand
isn't wielding it.

150
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,767
In the end,
you're nothing but a tool.

151
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,983
[TOKISADA]
How pathetic, you pile of scrap!

153
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,368

Don't you see?

I'm a walking arsenal!

They don't call me Tokisada

165
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,717
[TOKISADA]
I see.

166
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,347
This is the madness
of a Gun Slave Unit.

167
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,848
[TOKISADA]
Still,

168
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,143
I refuse to be
defeated in this gutter!

[yells]

170
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,162
[TOKISADA]
How did it come to this?

171
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,249
After taking such calculated
pains to push Gondry

172
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,418
right over the edge of reason...

173
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,754
After eliminating
those meddling officers

174
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,715
who came to inspect
the research facility...

175
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,177
To protect the dignity
of all Extended...

176
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,220
No.

177
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:46,516
The nobility of a hero such as
myself shall never be sullied!

178
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,477
[TOKISADA]
I must remedy this.

179
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,731
I have to silence Gondry
before he regains his sanity.

180
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,401
[OLIVIER]
Sounds suspicious.

181
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,568
[TOKISADA]
Oh?

182
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,363
[OLIVIER]
And memorable.

183
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,448
[TOKISADA]
Hm?

184
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,159
So go on then.

185
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,162
You'd better tell me
every last detail.

186
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,708
[TOKISADA]
Oh, it's you.

187
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,128
You're the acting
director of the EMS.

188
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,587
That means the needle‐thrower

189
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,216
and the gun head
must be your lackeys.

190
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,553
You've caused me a lot
of needless headaches.

191
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:28,016
Ten years ago, Gondry went
berserk at Norse Scott

192
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,768
during a routine
facilities inspection there.

193
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,938
He murdered 16 officers
of the military police.

194
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,443
My father was included among
the casualties on that day.

195
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,987
It was the Nightmare
of Norse Scott.

196
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,574
At least, that's what
we were led to believe.

197
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,785
Yet you said they
were all eliminated.

198
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,038
Interesting word choice.

199
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,373
What did you mean by that?

200
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,129
[TOKISADA] Every part of
the research that we conducted

201
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,924
was done for the future of
the Extended in this country‐‐

202
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,968
to give hope.

203
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,470
Despite our efforts,

204
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,639
our virtuous mission
was misunderstood.

205
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,517
I simply did what I had to do!

206
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,602
Right.

207
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,107
I see. So then you were
the one who murdered my father!

208
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,943
[TOKISADA]
Causing headaches yet again.

209
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,362
A hero like me should never

210
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,323
have to raise his fist
against a helpless woman,

211
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,533
but you've left me no choice!

212
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,288
‐‐[TOKISADA] Hm?
‐‐[TETSURO] Stop! Listen to me.

213
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,540
[TETSURO] Can you please
calm down already?

214
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,918
Hey! There's no need
to lose your cool

215
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,753
just because you
ran out of cigarettes!

216
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,046
[gasps] Juzo?

217
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,840
[TETSURO] This is embarrassing!
Aren't you an adult?!

218
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,926
[OLIVIER]
That form...

219
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,887
He's gone berserk after
running out of his medication.

220
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,682
[JUZO snarling]

221
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,393

[TOKISADA groans]

225
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,650
[TETSURO]
I said stop it!

226
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,318
[TETSURO groans]

227
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,738
[OLIVIER gasps]

228
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,906
[TOKISADA]
I won't‐‐

229
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:10,159
[TOKISADA groaning]
I won't give up.

230
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:14,163
No matter the price,
honor must prevail!

231
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,582
I have faith in my cause.

232
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,335
I will never allow
it to be shaken!

233
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,089
[OLIVIER]
Make sure you stay in one piece.

234
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,967
[OLIVIER'S DAD]
Gotcha, Princess. I promise.

235
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,476
[OLIVIER'S DAD]
Ya know,

236
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,854
Norse Scott is famous
for their tinned delicacies.

237
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,730
How 'bout I bring some home?

238
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,321
[OLIVIER]
Please...

239
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,198
...finish him.

240
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,581
[OLIVIER]
I'm begging you.

241
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,877
Do it!

242
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,129
[ELECTRIC VOICE A]
Funke Faust.

243
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,088
[TOKISADA]
N‐No‐‐

244
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,883
[crash]

245
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,645
But why?

246
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,189
[JUZO]
His death...

247
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,901
...is that what you really want?

248
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,985
[gasps]

249
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,198
We've also been given a
once in a lifetime opportunity!

250
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,783
After he's caught,
we can drag Gondry to court!

251
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:38,164
Promise, Juzo! You'll bring
that monster back alive!

252
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,540
He promised.

253
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,250
That's right!

254
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,920
[TOKISADA grunts]

255
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:48,257
[TOKISADA] Finally, your
sub‐brain is completely fried!

256
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,637
Just as I thought, this is
a sign that the people need me.

257
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,679
No.

258
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,557
That the world needs me!

259
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,309
Juzo!

260
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,436
[TOKISADA]
Could you even imagine?

261
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,481
What if the public
had found out the truth?

262
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,902
The entire country would
fall into utter chaos!

263
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,321
The bridge I worked
so hard to build between

264
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:14,242
Extendeds and the anti‐Extendeds
would crumble completely.

265
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,827
Distrust would increase
among the people.

266
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,080
The discord sown would plunge us

267
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,042
into deeper segregation
and economic disparity.

268
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,293
In other words,

269
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:28,256
without me, progress would
simply cease to exist!

270
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,423
Really?

271
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,342
[TOKISADA grunts]

272
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,511
[OLIVIER]
My father was the kind of fool

273
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,055
who gave up his own
happiness without a thought.

274
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,267
He'd do anything to
fight for a worthy cause.

275
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,643
After all,

276
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,855
he was a strong man who wished
for the peace of his homeland.

277
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,651
You'll never come close to him.

278
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,737
You talk a big game
and flash your laurels,

279
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,782
but the only thing you
care about is your ego.

280
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,577
You're nothing more
than a petty criminal.

281
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,871
You're just all
smoke and no fire.

282
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,793
[TOKISADA]
Am I now?

283
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,672
Well, then, you'd better
hurry up and put me out.

284
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,923
Hm?

285
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,151
[OLIVIER] Justice must
be gained under the law.

286
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,652
To think I was
about to lose sight

287
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,488
of what my old man taught me.

288
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,365
But thanks to you,

289
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,827
I was able to keep my eyes
on what truly matters.

290
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,124
Come on, are you about to
let your client die on you...

[JUZO]
My bad, I dozed off.

295
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,802
All that preaching was so boring

296
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,555
I thought I'd cool
my barrel for a sec.

about loose cannons‐‐

Damn, kid.

Didn't I tell you
to stop using Harmony?

That's not what you said.

Huh?

324
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,339
[TETSURO]
As I remember,

325
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:19,593
you told me never to use it
on you and not for nothing.

326
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,512
But this happened
because you had all of us

327

locked up back there.

I get it, you were worried.

Huh.

ever now, aren't ya, kid?

quite the scandal.

[TOKISADA]
You really don't get it, do you?

341
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,182
There's nothing that
the Department of Justice

342
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:12,021
can do about any of this,
let alone your hopeless EMS.

343
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,356
What do you mean?

344
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,567
[TOKISADA]
Stop and think for a moment.

Who do you think set me up
to be a hero in the first place?

Of course, it's
exactly what I thought.

00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,243
You're merely their‐‐

348
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,045
[SEVEN]
Direct hit on target.

349
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,088
Mission complete, Pepper.

350
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,383
[PEPPER]
I would still prefer to avoid

351
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,471
using your power as
a Gun Slave though, Seven.

352
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,765
Ya know, I always
get a runny nose

353
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,893
whenever I smell
the smoke from your muzzle.

354
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:51,977
Oh, well.

355
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,357
A hero becomes complete
through death, or so they say.

356
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,900
Congratulations.

357
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,320
Well done,
you little Beruhren puppet.

358
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,539
[CUNNINGHAM] Everything has gone
exactly as you have requested.

359
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,916
[PEPPER] What are you
squealing about, you little pig?

360
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,083
[JUZO]
And Olivier? How is she?

361
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,085
[MATILDA, IMELDA] We are
grateful to our Honorable COO.

362
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,421
[HONEST] At the very least,
we should pay our respects.

363
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:46,467
[JUZO]
<i>No Guns Life</i> Episode Nine:

364
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,385
"Reverberation."

00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,638
[HIGH OFFICIAL A]
Olivier, we gave you

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,474
specific instructions
to eliminate Gondry

3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:19,102
and to do so using
extreme secrecy.

4
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,104
You've not only disobeyed us,

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,357
but we've heard
disturbing rumors.

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:27,528
It would appear that you've been
taking action behind our backs.

7
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,862
Please understand.

8
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,280
Gondry's an important witness

9
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,158
regarding the Nightmare
of Norse Scott.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,118
As the director of EMS,

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,580
I decided it was necessary
to capture him alive.

12
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,250
[HIGH OFFICIAL A]
Hmm. If I remember correctly,

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,919
your father was
involved in that incident.

14
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,754
He was one of the
murdered officers

15
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,924
from the military police, yes?

16
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,718
And here I thought the
idea of eliminating his killer

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,472
and getting revenge would
have appealed to you.

18
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,433
[OLIVIER] My feelings
don't interfere with my job.

19
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,851
Doesn't matter.

20
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,771
I have already assigned
someone far more capable

21
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,773
to clean up this mess.

22
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,109
And until this incident
is fully resolved,

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,361
consider yourself suspended.

24
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,114
That is all.

25
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,199
[OLIVIER grunts]

26
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,410
[OLIVIER]
If you'll excuse me.

27
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,247
[OLIVIER]
Juzo.

28
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,209
Please, take him alive!

29
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,012
[TOKISADA]
Gondry!

30
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,222
What are you doing here?

31
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,811
[TOKISADA grunts]
Where did he go?

32
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,066
[GONDRY snarls]

33
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,364
[GONDRY groans]

34
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,741
[TOKISADA]
Hmm?

35
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,119
[JUZO]
That's a neat trick.

36
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,539
I didn't expect a renegade
Extended to use a decoy.

37
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,541
Seems a little too subtle.

38
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,837
[GONDRY grunting]

39
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,804
[JUZO]
You okay, old man?

40
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,890
[TOKISADA]
Mm‐hm...

41
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,642
[KRONEN]
He got away.

42
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,934
[JUZO]
Looks like that freakshow

43
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,395
has plenty of
tricks in his chamber.

44
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,231
[TOKISADA]
That form‐‐

45
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,026
I believe they were
called Gun Slave Units.

46
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,235
[JUZO]
Huh?

47
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:36,948
[TOKISADA]
I saw your type during the war.

48
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,117
Why are you here?

49
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,883
[EMS OFFICER A] Word is Director
Olivier has been replaced.

50
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,469
[EMS OFFICER B]
What should we do now?

51
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,137
[EMS OFFICER A]
Well, I mean,

52
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:26,141
I think all we can do is
wait for our next orders.

53
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,518
Sounds like there's
major drama going on.

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,854
Maybe something
happened to Juzo.

55
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,690
[CHRISTINA]
Don't be ridiculous!

56
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,402
Mark my words, he's the one
causing the problems.

57
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,488
You think so?

58
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,864
[MARY sighs]

59
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,452
[TETSURO]
Is that Juzo's brand?

60
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,705
I had planned on giving
it to him in the morning.

61
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,873
[TETSURO]
But...

62
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,875
...aren't those cigarettes
pretty much the only thing

63
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,253
around that can ease the
strain put on his extensions?

64
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,172
[MARY]
Mm. And by my calculations,

65
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,925
he should be running
low on 'em right about now.

66
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,885
[TETSURO]
That doesn't sound good.

67
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,554
In a word, yeah.

68
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,600
Issue is... I don't think
that's the only problem.

69
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,687
These things ward off more than
just the stress on Juzo's body.

70
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,774
It's like's he's desperately
trying to suppress something.

71
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,818
Keeping the past at bay.

72
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,030
But, then again,
this might be a perfect chance

73
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,866
for our favorite smoking
gun to quit cold turkey.

74
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,909
[TETSURO grunts]

75
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,497
You good?

76
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,962
[TETSURO] Hey! You out there!
Open up this door, now!

77
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,922
Have you gone completely insane?

78
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:42,133
[TETSURO] What's the matter?
Am I not loud enough for you?

79
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,053
[EMS OFFICER B] Prisoners
will refrain from shouting!

80
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,222
[TETSURO] Just big enough
for cigarettes to fit through.

81
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,348
[EMS OFFICER B]
Say what?

82
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,976
Juzo was caught because of me.

83
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,854
I'm going to repay my debt.

84
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,565
[MARY] Hold on.
You're not thinking of...

85
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,109
[TETSURO]
If Juzo needs those cigarettes,

86
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,820
I'll make sure he gets them.

87
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,946
[EMS OFFICER B]
Huh?

88
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,331
[JUZO]
The name is Juzo Inui.

89
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,834
Somebody asked me
to capture Gondry.

90
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,335
That's why I'm here.

91
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,880
[TOKISADA]
I see.

92
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,090
[JUZO]
You probably haven't heard yet,

93
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:26,386
but I've got some bad news about
your buddies from Tindalos.

94
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,014
Gondry knocked them off.

95
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,473
[TOKISADA]
He what?

96
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,853
[JUZO] And it seems you were
going to be his final target.

97
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,189
[TOKISADA]
All of them.

98
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,025
How terrible.

99
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,655
[JUZO] You served together.
Why is Gondry after you?

100
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,032
[TOKISADA]
There's no shortage of people

101
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,243
who want to tear
down a hero like me.

102
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:54,039
However, he targeted the
other members of the unit.

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,334
Gondry should have no reason
to eliminate comrades

104
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,712
who fought alongside
him during the war.

105
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,132
Still, I suppose the past
doesn't matter to him

106
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,384
now that he's gone berserk.

107
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,053
[JUZO]
Hm?

108
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,554
[TOKISADA]
His extensions were designed

109
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,141
specifically for assassinations.

110
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,643
The iridophore nano crystals

111
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,354
embedded in his
armored sub‐arms,

112
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,981
as well as the dummy face
on the back of his head,

113
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,151
give him the power to
mimic nearly anything.

114
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,403
[TOKISADA]
Combine that tech with his

115
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,031
exceptional close
quarters combat skills‐‐

116
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,618
he's never failed
to take out a target.

117
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,370
But abilities came at a price

118
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,998
and caused immense
stress on his sub‐brain.

119
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,126
The continued extension
treatments he received

120
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,712
eventually ate
away at his nerves.

121
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,173
[JUZO]
As a result,

122
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,592
the Nightmare of
Norse Scott occurred...

123
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,303
...along with
these recent murders.

124
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,806
[TOKISADA]
And here we are.

125
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,641
[KRONEN]
Mimicry, huh?

126
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,726
Well, that kind of
power explains why

127
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:00,063
full‐bodied Extendeds are
being murdered so easily.

128
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,358
[JUZO]
What happened earlier, Kronen?

129
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,277
Getting slow on the draw
and miss your target?

130
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,697
I know the trigger points

131
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,907
of nearly every
recent model produced.

132
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,743
Speed and accuracy
aren't the issue here.

133
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,955
Irregular models like Gondry
have unique trigger points

134
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,000
which make them more challenging
to subdue than normal.

135
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,668
In special cases like this,

136
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,671
it's standard procedure
to aim for the sub‐brain.

137
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,631
But the history logs
stored within those

138
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,675
can be useful evidence in court.

139
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,803
So I avoid damaging
them if possible.

140
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,721
On top of that,

141
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,391
Gondry is likely using an older
model sub‐brain that's internal,

142
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:40,603
meaning it's much more difficult
to pinpoint its exact location.

143
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,646
[JUZO]
In other words,

144
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,025
it's gonna be that much more
difficult to capture him alive.

145
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,319
Huh. Here's some more
good news for you.

146
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,489
I have new orders from
the substitute director.

147
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,367
[JUZO]
Substitute? Meaning what?

148
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,288
It seems that Director Olivier
has been relieved of her post,

149
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,957
and all EMS officers
are to remove themselves

150
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,959
from this case at once.

151
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,128
The top brass want Gondry dead

152
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,048
and the whole affair
swept under the rug.

153
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,302
[JUZO]
Yeah, it figures.

154
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,430
Superiors are all the same.

155
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,600
They get it in their heads that
you can make a problem go away

156
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,353
by killing it and
pretending it doesn't exist.

157
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,355
But once you fire a bullet,

158
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,193
it can't be put
back into the chamber.

159
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,946
And it always ends up leaving
some kind of mark behind.

160
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,454
[KRONEN]
Ex‐Director Olivier no longer

161
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,998
has the authority
to protect you.

162
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,042
There's no reason
to involve yourself

163
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,835
in this case any longer.

164
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,882
[JUZO] You just don't
get it, do you, Kronen?

165
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,510
If I don't hear
from Olivier herself,

166
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,013
then the job isn't finished yet.

167
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,683
Until I do, there's
no reason to quit.

168
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,269
[JUZO]
Not to mention,

169
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,231
if I bring Gondry back
alive and talking,

170
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,400
her superiors may have to
reconsider their position.

171
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,694
Especially once the
truth about Norse Scott

172
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,239
is finally made public.

173
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,199
Huh?

174
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,117
This one time,

175
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,203
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear you say that.

176
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,790
We're even now,
which means I don't owe you

177
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:27,085
for the information you
supplied me about Gondry.

178
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,130
[clattering]

179
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,799
[TOKISADA] Government
officials never change.

180
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,384
Doesn't matter the era‐‐

181
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:38,012
they value orders more
than their friends.

182
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,182
[JUZO] That'd be the case,
except we aren't friends.

183
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,183
[TOKISADA]
Hm?

184
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,894
[JUZO] We both do
pretty much what we want.

185
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,149
[JUZO]
Ain't that right, Kronen?

186
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,820
[TOKISADA] Have no fear,
my distinctive‐headed friend.

187
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,531
Just seeing the magnificence
of a hero like myself

188
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:00,326
generally discourages
follow‐up attacks. [chuckles]

189
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,579
[JUZO]
If you say so, old man.

190
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,038
Let's hope.

191
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,792
[GONDRY snarls]

192
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,296
[JUZO gasps, groans]

193
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,091
[TOKISADA groans]

194
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,305
[GONDRY] That needle‐thrower
gave me trouble.

195
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,140
But with him out of the picture,

196
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,226
we can continue
where we left off.

197
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,729
What do you say, "hero"?

198
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,440
I think it's time you died!

199
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,820
[GONDRY] After I kill you,
they'll have to reevaluate me

200
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,949
and realize I'm needed again.

201
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,701
[TOKISADA]
Now I see.

202
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,412
As a fellow experimental
subject during the war,

203
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,166
we were constantly
expected to produce results.

204
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,710
Did you think by killing
your comrades‐in‐arms

205
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,795
anything was going to change?

206
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,216
That you'd somehow prove
your continued value?

207
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,592
Is that it?

208
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,676
[JUZO]
I get it.

209
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,178
[GONDRY gasps]

210
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,186
[JUZO] You're proud of
your high‐end extensions.

211
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,481
Only problem is they
take a toll on the body.

212
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,234
My body's pretty
inefficient as well.

213
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,781
[JUZO] And if I wanna keep it
running, I can't stop smoking.

214
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,825
So what do you say
to a test of stamina?

215
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,705
[JUZO]
Let's do this. Me and you.

216
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,334
And we'll see whose
sub‐brain fries first!

217
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:45,932
[JUZO grunts]

218
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,393
[GONDRY yells]

219
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,360
[TOKISADA]
Juzo has foregone defense

220
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,154
in favor of overwhelming power.

221
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:04,909
The only thing is... the man has
such a reckless fighting style.

222
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,996
[JUZO grunts]

223
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,122
[JUZO gasps]

224
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,498
[GONDRY chuckles]

225
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,001
[groans]

226
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,920
[chuckles, groans]

227
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:20,800
[groaning]

228
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,472
[JUZO] If you hadn't
fallen into madness,

229
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,182
you might've actually
been worshipped

230
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,643
and treated like a hero.

231
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:34,272
But they took advantage
of you, and now look at you.

232
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,065
It's pathetic.

233
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,987
[JUZO] I bet it feels like
you're stuck in a nightmare‐‐

234
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,364
one you can never wake up from.

235
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:49,746
[JUZO] But this isn't a dream
'cause what you did was real,

236
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,832
and the scars have
already been made.

237
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,876
Now, it's time
for me to wake you up

238
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,503
so you can see
the damage you've done!

239
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,178
[GONDRY grunts]

240
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,598
[JUZO] I guess you
aren't a morning person.

241
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,856
[JUZO]
You blocked that just in time.

242
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:21,235
But it looks like you won't be
playing hide‐and‐seek anymore.

243
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,447
[TOKISADA]
Oh. As he over‐heats,

244
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,408
the location of his
sub‐brain is exposed.

245
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,826
[GONDRY grunts]

246
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,290
[TOKISADA]
You can do it, Mr. Gun Slave!

247
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,084
Go get him! One last push!

248
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,419
[JUZO groans]

249
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,757
[JUZO] I hate to say it,
but I'm counting on you.

250
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,925
[TOKISADA]
Hm?

251
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,727
[JUZO] I'm counting on you
to be stubborn enough to do

252
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,687
what needs to be done,

253
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,982
regardless of the orders
your superiors give you.

254
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,532
[GONDRY groaning]

255
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,705
Prisoner Number 0001.

256
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,666
Name, Hayden Gondry.

257
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,626
You're headed back
to your prison cell

258
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,087
to be judged for your crimes.

259
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,925
[JUZO]
Took ya long enough, Kronen.

260
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,929
If I wasn't waiting here, this
prisoner would've escaped.

261
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,556
Show some gratitude.

262
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,099
[JUZO]
What'd you say?

263
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,809
I left you something to do,

264
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,146
since you're always
going on about your duty.

265
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,190
You should be
the one thanking me.

266
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,024
[TOKISADA]
Hmm.

267
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,444
He purposefully put
himself in danger

268
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:48,281
to ensure that Gondry
was captured alive.

269
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,907
Huh. You should shut up

270
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,743
before you embarrass
yourself any further, Juzo.

271
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,872
[TOKISADA] Even if he fell,
he believed the needle‐thrower

272
00:15:55,913 --> 00:16:00,084
would stop Gondry once
he could locate the sub‐brain.

273
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,043
[JUZO]
You son of a‐‐

274
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,170
Keep talking.

275
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,131
See if I don't throw
you into Wunder Bender.

276
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,550
[JUZO]
Bastard. You wouldn't dare.

277
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,968
[KRONEN]
Oh?

278
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,180
[TOKISADA]
Hmm. These two are a threat.

279
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,018
[PEPPER gasps]

280
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,978
[SEVEN]
What is it, Pepper?

281
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,858
My connection with Gondry
was interrupted quite suddenly.

282
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,111
By someone who
looks just like you.

283
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,864
[SEVEN]
Like me? No way.

284
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,201
[PEPPER]
This Harmony thing‐‐

285
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,329
it really does let
you control Extendeds,

286
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,790
but the mind of its owner
ends up messing with your own.

287
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,712
[PEPPER] And I was this
close to killing Armed, too.

288
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,007
[chuckles] Guess I shouldn't
have played around so much.

289
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:55,014
Whoever you are, Mr. Gun Head,
this isn't over yet.

290
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,067
[RECON A] Ex‐Director Olivier,
I implore you to hurry.

291
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,611
You really shouldn't
be making any stops.

292
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,114
We've been assigned to
take you home and protect you.

293
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,866
I heard you the first time.

294
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:14,951
One more thing.

295
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,579
Your job is to watch me,
so drop the white knight act.

296
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,166
[CORONER] I can see
you're rather agitated.

297
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,377
However, would
you mind saving that

298
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,462
until after you
leave the morgue?

299
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,507
I don't have much time.
Speed things up a bit.

300
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,302
All right then, just don't
open that can. I'm begging you.

301
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,346
The stench is so hard to remove.

302
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,890
Well, then, let's hear it.

303
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,520
It's exactly as
I wrote in the report.

304
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,480
Among the three victims,

305
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,024
the one who stands out
as completely different

306
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,986
in the manner of death
is the delivery driver.

307
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,738
While all three suffered
deep lacerations,

308
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,156
after looking at the bodies,

309
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,992
I determined that
was the cause of death

310
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,952
for only two of the victims.

311
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,329
But the driver was killed
in a different manner‐‐

312
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:04,792
by an impact to the chest
which caused his heart to stop.

313
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,252
What does that mean?

314
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,380
Are you saying that Gondry tried
to hide how the victim died?

315
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,506
It's possible.

316
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,800
Or somebody else
was responsible.

317
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,720
Shame. If only the
sub‐brain were intact,

318
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,890
we'd be able to know more about
the crime, but alas, it's not.

319
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,435
Someone besides Gondry?

320
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,353
But who?

321
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,396
[OLIVIER gasps]

322
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,024
[RECON A]
Ex‐Director, it's time.

323
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,193
If you'd kindly
follow me to the car.

324
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,653
[RECON A groans]

325
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,865
[TETSURO]
I tried imitating Juzo,

326
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,867
successfully, I'd say.

327
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,578
Um, and just who are you?

328
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,497
[TETSURO]
My name is Tetsuro.

329
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,460
Anyway, I need you to lead
me to where Juzo is, now!

330
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,473
[JUZO]
Pitch in, Kronen.

331
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,601
Stop making an injured man
do all the heavy lifting.

332
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,936
It may seem there's
no end to my talents,

333
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,272
but a human can't
carry an Extended.

334
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,732
[JUZO]
Hey, old man!

335
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,109
Think you could help
me out and lend a hand?

336
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,157
[JUZO] What are you doing?
The door won't open itself.

337
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,494
[TOKISADA]
You don't say.

338
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,372
This must be one of those
doors you open manually.

339
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,123
How quaint.

340
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,293
[JUZO sighs]
Whatever.

341
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,046
Be sure not to damage
the prisoner any further.

342
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,047
[JUZO]
Hm.

343
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,132
He's an important
witness, after all.

344
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,469
Finally, we'll know about
the Nightmare of Norse Scott.

345
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,096
Not to mention
he can possibly help

346
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,641
clear the Ex‐Director
and get her reinstated.

347
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,644
[JUZO] Guess Gondry's not
the only mimic around here.

348
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,979
[KRONEN] Then again, could
be a chance he's useless

349
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,315
and you've been carrying
dead weight all this time,

350
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,526
after you went and
trashed his sub‐brain.

351
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,610
[JUZO]
Didn't your parents tell you

352
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,279
not to play around
with guns, Kronen?

353
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,369
[GONDRY yelling]

354
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,121
[KRONEN]
Tranquilizer's worn off!

355
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,415
Hurry up and hold
him down, Inui!

356
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,128
[groans]

357
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,593
[GONDRY]
Where am I? Wait, the war.

358
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,887
It's over?

359
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:28,060
All gone. My squad.
That's right.

360
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,896
Those guys and me,

361
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,482
we were...

362
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,820
[JUZO]
What's he talking about?

363
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,823
It sounds like he's in
some state of confusion.

364
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,160
We need to hurry and get him
treated at a medical facility.

365
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,872
If he regains sanity,
we may be able to obtain intel.

366
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,377
[TOKISADA]
How unfortunate.

367
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,380
I never thought it
would end this way.

368
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,343
[TOKISADA] But you've
left me with no options.

369
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,305
If the truth about
Norse Scott had come to light,

370
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,806
it would have
slowed the progress

371
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,683
of extension technology.

372
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,310
And this country's
economic boom

373
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,729
after the war
may have never occurred.

374
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,023
Can you imagine that?

375
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,403
[TOKISADA] That is why
I cannot allow Gondry

376
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:23,866
to tell the truth about what
really happened ten years ago.

377
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,041
[TOKISADA]
And sadly, why the two of you

378
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,294
must perish alongside him!

379
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,963
Why, you bastard!

380
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,048
[KRONEN groans]

381
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,300
[JUZO]
Kronen!

382
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,679
[TOKISADA]
Don't just stand there.

383
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,308
Show me the power
that I gave you!

384
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,018
[JUZO]
Damn it, Armed!

385
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,978
[TOKISADA]
Funke...

386
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,939
[JUZO]
...Faust!

387
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,831
[TOKISADA] Now do you finally
understand, Mr. Gun Slave?

388
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,625
[OLIVIER] So you're the
one who killed my father!

389
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,459
[TETSURO]
You should be embarrassed

390
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,835
to call yourself an adult!

391
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,504
[OLIVIER]
I'm begging you, Juzo!

392
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:47,259
[JUZO]

393
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,636
"Will."

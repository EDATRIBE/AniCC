00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,027
[MATILDA]
Good day to you...

2
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,404
[IMELDA]
...dear members of Wurzel.

3
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:37,454
[HONEST] Good day to you
both, Matilda, Imelda.

4
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:42,042
The others seem indisposed, so
I shall listen to your report.

5
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:46,046
[MATILDA, IMELDA]
We thank you, COO Honest.

6
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,172
[MATILDA]
Actually...

7
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,257
[IMELDA]
...there's someone here

8
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,467
who wishes to meet
with the board in person.

9
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,970
[footsteps]

10
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,352
[HONEST] This is a surprise. If
it isn't our chief of security.

11
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:04,147
How long has it been since
I saw you last, Cunningham?

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,400
[CUNNINGHAM] I believe the
last occasion I had the pleasure

13
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,527
was after the unsuccessful
negotiations

14
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,862
with that Resolver
in the Kyusei Pit.

15
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,324
It was, uh, an
inquiry into my failure.

16
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,576
I come before you today,

17
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,369
groveling and
completely unworthy,

18
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,704
hoping that there's
still a chance

19
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,081
I may somehow redeem myself.

20
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,457
And to share that even though

21
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,501
it wasn't part of
the original plan,

22
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,503
I'm pleased to report
we've successfully

23
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:30,007
decommissioned Armed‐‐
permanently.

24
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,437
[CUNNINGHAM]
The former Mega Armed Tokisada.

25
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,148
As you'll recall, we lavished
him with wealth and power

26
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,067
over the course of many years,

27
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,403
built his reputation
up from nothing,

28
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,906
made him into a hero‐‐
the ideal Extended.

29
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,409
[CUNNINGHAM] However,
everything changed very recently

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,203
when a former member of
Tindalos threatened to reveal

31
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,289
the truth and go public about
what actually happened

32
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,042
at the Nightmare of Norse Scott.

33
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,877
In response to
hearing this news,

34
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,047
Armed foolishly murdered
the man, and then asked

35
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:37,968
for our assistance in
covering up the crime.

36
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,471
We took control of Gondry
and made him kill the others

37
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,641
to frame him for
the original slaying.

38
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,518
And after eliminating Armed,

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,897
made it appear as if
he was the final victim.

40
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,776
Exactly as you've
commanded, COO.

41
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,571
[HONEST] His obsession
with honor knew no bounds.

42
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:02,117
I have to admit, initially even
I was impressed by his avarice.

43
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,454
At least, until he began to
mistake the power granted to him

44
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,165
as his own.

45
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,833
That was his error.

46
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,377
However, Chief of
Security Cunningham,

47
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,131
I do not recall permitting
you to use a Gun Slave Unit,

48
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,092
or ordering you to
involve EMS's director.

49
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,385
[gasps]

50
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,763
[MATILDA] The COO
can be quite malicious.

51
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,055
[IMELDA]
So true.

52
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,141
[MATILDA, IMELDA giggle]

53
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,560
[STRANGE] Even the smallest
misplaced gear within the

54
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:33,148
grand mechanism of the company
can lead to disastrous results.

55
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,068
[CUNNINGHAM]
Uh! CSO Strange, you're here?

56
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,445
[STRANGE]
The facility has requested

57
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,989
more subjects for
their experiments.

58
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,657
And you'd already be there now

59
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,410
if your body was
even fit for testing.

60
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,828
[gasps]

61
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,206
[STRANGE] Since it's not,
perhaps the best option

62
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,583
is turning you into
an actual gear.

00:04:55,504 --> 00:05:00,175
your failures haven't reached
the ears of CEO Arahabaki yet.

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,870
I was chewed out thanks
to the second‐rate job

you two ended up doing.

Excuse me?

00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,585

00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,530

end to the Great War

than half a century!

138
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,165
it stands for the evolutionary
tree of our species.

00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,517
Usually you're good at
saying the wrong thing

175
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,477
at the wrong time.

176
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,896
[JUZO]
You still got business with me?

177
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,401
Juzo! I wanna stay here
and help you with your work!

178
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:16,032
About the money, I've no
way to pay you back yet.

179
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,159
But... I can be
useful with Harmony!

180
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,869
[JUZO]
Don't be stupid!

181
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:24,415
Your life's in the crosshairs
because of that thing.

182
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,292
Or did you forget?

183
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,879
And besides, it renders others
as nothing but tools,

184
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,090
which we both despise.

185
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,134
[grunts] I didn't...

186
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,345
[MARY] The only one being
an idiot here is you, Juzo.

187
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,096
[grunts]

188
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,889
Maybe your brain misfired,

189
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,016
but you're only alive
'cause of him!

190
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,351
If he hadn't rescued you,

191
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,521
you'd be sold as scrap parts
in the Kyusei Pit by now.

192
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,523
[JUZO]
Jeez, Mary.

193
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,733
It's still better
to be a pile of junk

194
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,153
than to get help
from some little kid.

195
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,237
[MARY growls]

196
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,405
Just 'cause you're made of iron

197
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,407
doesn't mean you hafta
be hard‐headed!

198
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,449
Why do you act like this

199
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,743
every time anyone tries
to help you out?

200
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,287
Agh! We're getting outta here!

201
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,998
If muzzle‐mouth wants to eat
his mochi‐<i>kinchaku</i> alone,

202
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,583
then we'll just let him!

203
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,959
[JUZO]
Uhh...

204
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,127
[BOTH]
Uh?

205
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,130
[JUZO] After going wild back
there in the tunnels,

206
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,883
getting a bite wouldn't hurt.

207
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,386
I suppose I could eat
the hotpot with ya.

208
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,804
This once.

209
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,766
[MARY] Was that supposed
to be a thank you?

210
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,727
What's wrong? Do two
little words scare you?

211
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,895
I swear, which one is the...

212
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,230
But I absolutely refuse
to eat any mochi!

213
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,774
That stuff shouldn't even
be considered food!

214
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,985
[MARY]
You gun‐faced teddy bear!

215
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,196
[JUZO]
Tetsuro!

216
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,822
For now, you should
start thinking

217
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,824
of ways to defend yourself.

218
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,159
Since word's gotten around

219
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,495
and interested parties
know where to find you.

220
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,789
As a matter of fact,
I wouldn't be surprised

221
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,960
if they burst through that
door at this very moment.

222
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:53,671
[gasps]

223
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,635
[CHRISTINA, SCARLET groan]

224
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,849
I know, it may look
like we're eavesdropping,

225
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,100
but that's just not true.

226
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,312
We just wanted to warn you
the hotpot was getting cold.

227
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,898
[CHRISTINA, SCARLET chuckle]

228
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,234
[JUZO]
I'll say this once.

229
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,693
Clear outta here.

230
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,195
You're ruining my appetite!

231
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,529
[TETSURO, SCARLET,
CHRISTINA yell]

232
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,031
[MARY laughs]

233
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,493
Oh, by the way...
I'll be moving in.

234
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,203
Starting today.

235
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,331
You're what?!

236
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,792
[CHRISTINA]
Sweepity‐sweep‐sweep.

237
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,710
Sweepity‐sweep.

238
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,422
[MARY] It may have been easier
to get parts in the Kyusei Pit,

239
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,383
but the whole scene is
pretty tense right now

240
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,426
because of how many
anti‐extension people

241
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,137
are around lately.

242
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,848
Good thing I'm done
patching up Ende.

243
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,185
Someone's gotta look
after you and Juzo.

244
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,397
Besides, I know he'll
always need repairs.

245
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,191
‐‐[MARY grunts]
‐‐[crack]

246
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,361
So I'm crashing here
for the moment.

247
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,157
Am I gonna have to do
these maintenance check‐ups

248
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,118
indefinitely from now on?

249
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,080
[MARY] The thing is, since we
aren't replacing any skin,

250
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,666
your body needs to get
regular check‐ups.

251
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,459
Same goes for the parts.

252
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,087
Not to mention, you haven't
finished growing yet.

253
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,047
We gotta stay on top of things.

254
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:18,840
[beep]

255
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,049
Oh.

256
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,844
You're electrical response
looks right on the money.

257
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,096
Not seeing any problems.

258
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,640
[TETSURO] You should have
amputated my legs.

259
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,934
It's not like they work anyway.

260
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,479
[MARY] Basic extensions put
less stress on the sub‐brain.

261
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,066
Also, once your legs are
removed, they're gone forever.

262
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,568
But if further down the road,

263
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,195
you discover that you
still feel the same way,

264
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,114
I'll handle any work you need.

265
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,658
No problem. I'll chop
your limbs right off.

266
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,454
After that, we can add
some cool extensions.

267
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,123
Hmm... Let's see.

268
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,126
Where'd I put those inner
liner replacements?

269
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:56,961
[TETSURO]
Mary,

270
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,630
why did you become
an extension engineer?

271
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,717
[MARY]
Mmm... Oh!

272
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,428
Ah‐ha! Finally found them!

273
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,682
Let's switch out the old ones
and get you feelin' like new!

274
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,351
[TETSURO]
Sorry. I asked you why you‐‐

275
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,519
Yeah, I heard you
the first time!

276
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,146
Ugh.

277
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,648
Seriously, you should
know better

278
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,318
than to ask a girl
about her past.

279
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,113
Then again, I guess an exception
can be made in your case.

280
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,658
[MARY]
For a while now,

281
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,329
I've been on a search
for someone.

282
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,539
The guy was a talented mechanic,

283
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,334
but he went to war as
a military engineer.

284
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,046
Like so many others,
he never came back.

285
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,219
Yeah, he might be dead,

286
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,180
but I just thought...
if I kept doing this job,

287
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,849
I'd see him again one day.

288
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,229
[TETSURO]
I hope you do... Find him.

289
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,980
[chuckles]

290
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,609
Yeah, me, too.

291
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,735
Make sure to let me know

292
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,196
if anything feels
off to you at all.

293
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,740
You did an amazing job.

294
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,492
[CHRISTINA]
Mary!

295
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,078
We've got an emergency!

296
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,080
[MARY]
What's the matter, Christina?

297
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,290
Just hurry up, would ya?

298
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,293
An Extended boy collapsed
in front of the building!

299
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,295
Come and take a look at him!

300
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,298
[MARY gasps]

301
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,925
[MARY]
Colt?

302
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,594
[TETSURO]
He sure was heavy.

303
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,806
[CHRISTINA] I should've figured
he was one of your patients.

304
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,016
That ought to do it.

305
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,937
I met him about half a year ago.
His name's Colt.

306
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:38,980
I found him passed out

307
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,315
and almost completely
out of medicine.

308
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,608
Medicine?

309
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,237
Yeah, believe it or not, lots
of people need them to function,

310
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,240
and not just
Over‐Extended like Juzo.

311
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,617
Colt received an illegal
extension treatment

312
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,704
that fitted him with
high‐output extensions.

313
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,458
Problem is, they put a lot
of stress on the sub‐brain.

314
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,460
But they help out at
construction sites.

315
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,671
That's how he
supports his family.

316
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,299
In this day and age,
there aren't many jobs available

317
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,469
for immigrants with
ordinary bodies.

318
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,971
[TETSURO]
So this was the result.

319
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,516
[MARY] We've pushed the limit
on the number of modifications,

320
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,851
but it looks like
it's about time

321
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,979
I started removing some
of his extensions.

322
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,024
[COLT]
Please, wait, <i>médica</i>!

323
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,236
Not yet. I need this body
of mine a bit longer.

324
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,035
That's all I can pay
you with today.

325
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,870
I know it's not that much.

326
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:40,374
[MARY gasping]

327
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,293
[MARY]
Check out the craftsmanship!

328
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,463
So clean despite the numbers
of delicate actuators.

329
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,342
You get maximum output without
depending on artificial muscles!

330
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,344
It looks old‐fashioned
on the outside,

331
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,472
but make no mistake,
this is the work of a genius!

332
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,016
How'd you get your hands
on something like this?

333
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,810
Heh. That piece of junk?

334
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,853
[MARY grumbles]

335
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:05,024
Something big's coming through.
A big job with a huge return.

336
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,442
As soon as it's wrapped,

337
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,903
I'll pay you what you
deserve, <i>médica</i>.

338
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,238
[MARY]
How big is big?

339
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,282
Yeah, the details
aren't important,

340
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,660
but I can afford
<i>Madre's</i> surgery.

341
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,288
Your mother's not well?
What's wrong with her?

342
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,959
Beruhen's new extensions.

343
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,378
You've heard about
them, right, <i>médica</i>?

344
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,837
What about them?

345
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,757
[MARY] Don't tell me.
Did she become a tester?

346
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,136
It paid. And besides that,
she got free extension work.

347
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,013
<i>Madre</i> said once she got better,

348
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,391
she wanted to start
working again.

349
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,646
[COLT] Turns out she wasn't
compatible with the sub‐brain.

350
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,856
It damaged her nerves.

351
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,941
But the news was saying

352
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,193
how all of the complaints
were taken back.

353
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,987
<i>Mentiras!</i>

354
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,239
It's a lie! All of it!

355
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,742
Beruhren Corp, they refused
to compensate us!

356
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,996
They've always
looked down on us!

357
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:04,625
Thing is, when a door shuts,
a window of opportunity opens.

358
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,753
We'll make it through somehow.
Thanks to this next job.

359
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,630
[MARY]
Don't get yourself killed.

360
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,507
I'll be careful.

361
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,092
Oh, and <i>médica</i>?

362
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,764
What's your size? An A cup?

363
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,437
B, duh. Nearly C.

364
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,855
[COLT]
Oh, yeah?

365
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,065
Working with more
than I thought.

366
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,735
[COLT]
Heh.

367
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,286
[COLT] Sorry, <i>médica</i>,
but to finish the job,

368
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,747
I'm gonna need to borrow this.

369
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,500
[TETSURO] What's your
definition of borrowing?

370
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,173
Return it and I won't tell Mary.

371
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,424
[chuckles]

372
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,592
[COLT grunts]

373
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,641
[gasps]

374
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,975
[COLT groans]

375
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,895
Crap! Too much!

376
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,114
[KAREN] From now on,
this is going to be your home.

377
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,533
[CUNNINGHAM] Due to your
betrayal of the company...

378
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,202
[WACHOWSKI]
On behalf of the organization,

379
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,829
thank you for your assistance,
Master Tetsuro.

380
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,539
We are grateful.

381
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,921
[COLT]
All right! Wake up!

382
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,215
[TETSURO]
What was that?

383
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,216
[COLT]
Hey!

384
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,386
Just now, what did
you do?! Tell me!

385
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:45,184
'Cause it was nuts! I thought my
sub‐brain was fried for sure!

386
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,229
Sorry if I overreacted
a bit. [laughs]

387
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,897
[TETSURO]
No. This is, um...

388
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,901
[COLT] You seem slow, but I
won't hold it against you.

389
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,904
They call me Colt. And you are?

390
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,032
The name is Tetsuro.

391
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,742
Nice to make your acquaintance.

392
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,245
So now that we're fast friends,
help me with the job.

393
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,663
A‐A job?

394
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,539
Yeah.

395
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,709
Some branches grew too long
and now we gotta cut 'em down.

396
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,335
I'll handle most of the work.

397
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,713
No need to put yourself
in any danger.

398
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,298
[TETSURO]
Why do I get the feeling

399
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,093
you're up to something shady?

400
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,346
Meeting you today and seeing
how rough you've had it,

401
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,765
you must have a lot
of determination,

402
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,268
but this is how you
decide to use it?

403
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,855
Well? You'd rather spend
your life being a criminal?

404
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,776
[COLT]
Is that what you think?

405
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,320
It's not about me.

406
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:42,575
Sometimes you just gotta give
people something to believe in.

407
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,201
Like a future.

408
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,877
[COLT] Tomorrow, at three,
the Mega Armed Memorial Ground.

409
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,005
Come, if you like.

410
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,090
Well, see ya.

411
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,894
Where did he go, Tetsuro?!

412
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,187
What? Mary?

413
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,147
This extension part
that Colt gave me,

414
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,649
Victor is the one who made it!

415
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,234
[TETSURO]
Who's Victor?

416
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,695
He's the one I've
been searching for!

417
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,655
My big brother!

418
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,993
[JUZO]
Mary. That thief.

419
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,538
She took off with nearly all
the cash I got from Olivier.

420
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,999
[JUZO]
Oh.

421
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,168
Hot! Hot! Hot!

422
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,378
[knocking]

423
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,589
[ROSSO]
Office is drafty as ever.

424
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,133
Did ya get that window fixed?

425
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,428
Hey. You remember me?

426
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,098
Gotta job for you
concerning Spitzbergen.

427
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,892
Figured you could help.

428
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,938
We need somebody to track down a
known associate of their group.

429
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,067
The target's a guy that goes
by the name of Saryshagan.

430
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,581
[COLT] I'm gonna show them
that it's not hopeless...

431
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,666
[TETSURO]
You can still turn back!

432
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,959
[ENEMY]
Damned immigrant rat!

433
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,295
[MARY] That's just an
ordinary boring crime!

434
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,463
[COLT]
Let go of me!

435
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,467
[JUZO]

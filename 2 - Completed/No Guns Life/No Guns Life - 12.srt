1
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:11,637
[GIRL A]
Didn't you know?

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,138
[GIRL B]
My parents told me to avoid

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,516
that neighborhood since
it's full of Extended!

4
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,309
They're such scary creatures.

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,811
You can never tell what
those things might be up to.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,979
[ROSA]
You really think so?

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,022
Uh?

8
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,274
[ROSA] To be fair,
maybe some of them are bad,

9
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
but they can't all
be like that, right?

10
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,571
[ROSA]
My name is Rosa McMahon.

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,365
I was a normal
girl going to school

12
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,408
and living an everyday life.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,284
[car honking]

14
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,619
[gasps]

15
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,415
[ROSA] Until an Extended
took my parents away from me.

16
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,418
[gasps]

17
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,301
[ROSA yelps]

18
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,012
[ROSA gasps]

19
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,931
[crash]

20
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,173
[JUZO]
My name's Juzo Inui.

21
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,716
Ever since the Great War,

22
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,636
the city's been
overflowing with Extended‐‐

23
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,388
people who went
through modifications

24
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,433
to fight or survive
or just to change.

25
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,478
It can be difficult to
reassimilate into society,

26
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,898
so I make a living
by cleaning up.

27
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,319
My current client is
this gentleman, Danny Yoe.

28
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,072
These steps are tricky,
so be careful.

29
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,491
[JUZO] Danny works for
the Department of Justice.

30
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,035
He wants me to
stand guard for Rosa.

31
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,497
She's the daughter of his
late colleague, George McMahon,

32
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,125
who apparently used
to own this place.

33
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,879
[JUZO] And, yeah, that
sounds like an ordinary gig...

34
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,673
...except a few days ago,

35
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,718
the family was in a pretty
terrible car accident.

36
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,262
Rosa's folks died on impact.

37
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:44,015
She got injured and lost
a leg, but she survived.

38
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,102
Since then, strange
and inexplicable events

39
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,395
have started happening.

40
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,814
People are saying
that she's being haunted,

41
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:54,359
and that a ghostly
Extended is to blame.

42
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,820
Because of that, most of
the house servants have quit.

43
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,113
As you can see there's hardly

44
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,991
anybody left to look
after the poor girl.

45
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,451
[JUZO]
I get it, but are you sure

46
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,369
you called the
right guy for this?

47
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,998
I may be a gun for hire,
but I'm no exorcist.

48
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,000
I think I've found a lead.

49
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,461
I came into contact
with this supposed ghost

50
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,755
and chased it
through the mansion.

51
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,214
Ohh!

52
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,595
[DANNY] Unfortunately, this is
where I lost track of the beast.

53
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,764
Please note the ground below.

54
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,475
[JUZO]
Hmm... Footprints?

55
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,309
[DANNY]
Yes.

56
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,021
[MARY] Wait, so it's
not some evil spirit?

57
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,023
[DANNY] I'm certain the
culprit is actually hunting

58
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,109
for valuable evidence
regarding a criminal case.

59
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,569
Ugh. That's all?

60
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,403
[DANNY]
Anyway,

61
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,407
Rosa's still convinced
there's a phantom lurking about.

62
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,493
However, my theory makes sense.

63
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,952
George and I worked primarily

64
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,538
on legal matters
involving Extended.

65
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,706
And I was hoping you could

66
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,000
at least uncover
the culprit's motive.

67
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,627
With that, we can
hopefully find a way

68
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,837
to put an end to all of this.

69
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,507
Whatever the case,

70
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,551
till we find the truth,
Rosa may be in danger.

71
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,469
You must understand

72
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,847
she is the precious daughter
of my dear old friend.

73
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,643
So please, lend us your
strength and protect her.

74
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,938
[JUZO]
I don't know.

75
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,524
This whole situation's
pretty sketchy.

76
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,235
[MARY] I went ahead and
got you more cigarettes.

77
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,654
And an invoice
for your convenience.

78
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,280
[JUZO grunts]

79
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,451
[JUZO]
No dodging this bullet.

80
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,919
Hello, dear,
you awake? It's just me.

81
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,838
I'm coming in now.

82
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,596
She's gone?

83
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,270
[ROSA]
No! Let me go!

84
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,064
Come on. Stop hiding
under the bed!

85
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,568
I have to! I know there's
someone out there watching me!

86
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,363
I keep telling you,
it's a ghost!

87
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,950
[ROSA gasps]

88
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,493
[DANNY]
Rosa?

89
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,370
[JUZO gasps]

90
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,622
No!

91
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,999
Uh, hey. Are you okay?

92
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,418
[ROSA] What is that
monster doing in my room?

93
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,419
Get him out!

94
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,212
[DANNY]
Calm down, it's all right!

95
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,716
I asked him to come here and
protect you for your own good.

96
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,220
Listen, young lady. There's
nothing trying to haunt you.

97
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,306
I've already told you,
it's likely a thief

98
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,309
searching through
this house for something.

99
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,686
Now I'll ask you
one more time, my dear.

100
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,565
Do you have any idea what
they might be looking for?

101
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,067
You're sure your father
didn't mention anything?!

102
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,278
[ROSA]
Stop. That hurts.

103
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,739
[DANNY gasps]
My apologies.

104
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,910
I think it's time we try
a more feminine approach.

105
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,162
[JUZO] No way, hotshot!
This is my job re‐‐

106
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,079
[MARY]
Hurry up and get out!

107
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,248
[JUZO]
Hey, wait!

108
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,125
[door closes]

109
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,296
[JUZO gasping] My chamber's
all wet! I'm gonna rust!

110
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,465
[DANNY]
Forgive me, Mr. Inui.

111
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,507
Ever since the accident,

112
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,470
Rosa's been very suspicious
of anyone with extensions.

113
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,307
[JUZO] I've got a face that
triggers people. I'm used to it.

114
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,433
Huh?

115
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,393
Hmm?

116
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,937
What's the matter?

117
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,611
[JUZO] Our ghost has
already shown himself.

118
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,279
You stay here.

119
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,199
Wait a moment!

120
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,164
[ROSA]
Um, who are you?

121
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,292
You can call me Mary.
Uh, I'm an engineer.

122
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,961
[ROSA]
An engineer?

123
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,462
For Extended.

124
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:46,341
I work on people like my big
friend Juzo that you just met.

125
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,843
[ROSA]
Get out!

126
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,179
I'm not sure what
Mr. Danny told you,

127
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,182
but I won't have
extension surgery!

128
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,060
You poor little thing.

129
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,438
I bet you haven't had the
chance to wash up properly.

130
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:02,857
Lucky for you,

131
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,194
I've got a lot of experience
taking care of patients!

132
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,581
[JUZO gasps]

133
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,464
[JUZO] I'm gonna have
to sew up my coat again!

134
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,301
[JUZO]
Which means,

135
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,389
you can lend a hand,
since you're obviously no ghost.

136
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,807
Huh?

137
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,976
Well, son of a gun.

138
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,613
So you've got something
against the Extended.

139
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,782
[MARY]
Some of them definitely

140
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,076
let their abilities
go to their heads.

141
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,286
And some do bad things

142
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,913
so they can pay their
maintenance bills.

143
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,957
But still, there
are good people.

144
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,626
Plenty of 'em choose this
life in order to survive.

145
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,420
Is that so wrong?

146
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,880
Whatever the reason,

147
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,340
I can't believe someone
would choose that.

148
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,510
It doesn't make any sense.

149
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,637
And I know what I saw.

150
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,056
That fateful night,

151
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,768
a ghastly arm crashed
through the windshield.

152
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,605
My father was doing work that
made the Extended hate him.

153
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,482
This was revenge.

154
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,817
[MARY] Your dad worked for
the Department of Justice,

155
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,069
am I right?

156
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,904
So that's... [gasps]

157
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,739
Wait! No way!

158
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,576
What the‐‐ Is that
a real Gustav MV 360?

159
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,953
[ROSA] That thing?
It was father's bike.

160
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,288
[MARY] You can't just
call it that thing!

161
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,207
Only five of these
precious speed demons

162
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,209
were ever produced
during the entire war!

163
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,503
The temperature from the
gas turbine engine exhaust

164
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,254
would get so high
after prolonged use

165
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,714
that it would melt
the bike itself!

166
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,801
Uh... uh...

167
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,804
Sorry. I guess
I got carried away.

168
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,140
[ROSA] No need to apologize.
We still have it in storage,

169
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,267
so you can do with
it as you please.

170
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,977
[gasps] Are you kidding me?

171
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,815
[ROSA] I mean... I won't
be able to use it anyway.

172
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,694
[MARY] You've been wearing
that this whole time.

173
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,947
Is it important to you?

174
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,784
Father gave it to me...
right before the accident.

175
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,536
Oh, you don't say?

176
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,037
[ROSA]
It's almost funny.

177
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,791
Who would think to give
a girl such a big, ugly pendant?

178
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,461
It was unlike him.
He seldom gave me presents.

179
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,591
[DANNY] Rosa! The intruder's
here once again!

180
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,594
Don't be so rude! You can't just
barge in on a girl like that!

181
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,471
There isn't time to explain!

182
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,307
Mr. Inui's fighting him off.
We must hurry to safety!

183
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,893
[MARY] Wait! Could you
not yank her around?

184
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:44,727
[ROSA gasps]

185
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,728
Let's go, now!

186
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,064
Put me down! I refuse
to surrender my house

187
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,525
to the ghost of an Extended!

188
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,776
[DANNY grunts]

189
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,239
‐‐[ROSA gasps]
‐‐Oh, thank goodness!

190
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,240
You're all right!

191
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,076
I was just about to find
a place for us to hide.

192
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,372
[JUZO] Sorry for the wait,
miss, thought I'd have a smoke.

193
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,832
You're awfully calm.

194
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:06,916
Could it be that you've already

195
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,043
taken care of our
mysterious trespasser?

196
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,462
[JUZO]
Not to sound slow on the draw,

197
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,047
but what would you
do if I told you

198
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,259
that thing really was a ghost?

199
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,304
That's impossible.
You remember those footprints‐‐

200
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,055
Tthe ones outside the window.

201
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,558
[JUZO]
That's a half‐cocked response.

202
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,980
[JUZO]
'Cause after all...

203
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,481
[DANNY, ROSA gasp]

204
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,527
[JUZO] ...last time I checked,
ghosts don't have feet.

205
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,530
Huh? [gasps]

206
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:41,618
[ROSA gasps]
It's that arm... from the crash.

207
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,079
No way! A hands‐only model?

208
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,541
Wait, why is it not
attacking you, Juzo?

209
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,879
[JUZO]
Sorry. You got it all wrong.

210
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,382
It's time you saw what's
really been haunting you.

211
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,894
[JUZO]
Question for ya.

212
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,103
It's pretty obvious you made

213
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,232
fake footprints for
an imaginary culprit.

214
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,859
Why'd you think you
had to take it that far?

215
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,780
[JUZO] This might
be a shot in the dark,

216
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,823
but I think you were trying
to trick her into thinking

217
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,369
somebody was after
something her dad left behind.

218
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,746
All in the hopes
that she'd give it up...

219
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,624
...right, Danny‐boy?

220
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,502
[gasps] What are you
talking about?

221
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,840
Uh, Juzo?

222
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,054
You gonna tell us what's up?

223
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,515
[inhales, screams]

224
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,809
‐‐[DANNY groans]
‐‐[ROSA, MARY gasp]

225
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,852
‐‐[DANNY groans]
‐‐[MARY] Are you kidding?

226
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,771
[MARY]
He has the place bugged?!

227
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,732
[DANNY] No, i‐it's not what
it looks like! I promise!

228
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,401
I was only thinking
about Rosa's safety‐‐

229
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,361
[JUZO]
You're way off the mark, pal.

230
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,696
[DANNY]
Huh?

231
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,408
[JUZO] She could've been
attacked at any moment.

232
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,327
Yet you didn't hire
a single guard to watch her.

233
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,537
Not to mention you left her

234
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,498
all on her own when
you came to hire me.

235
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,169
[JUZO] Because you knew
she wouldn't get hurt,

236
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,423
'cause she was never
in any real danger.

237
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,639
[JUZO] Now, if I were you,
I'd hand over the girl.

238
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,143
[ROSA]
No.

239
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,147
You're nothing but
a heartless Extended.

240
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,025
I'd never believe
a word from you.

241
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,152
But Rosa!

242
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,070
[JUZO] Really? Did you
not hear a single th‐‐

243
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,822
Don't touch me!

244
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,783
You decided to become a weapon

245
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,745
so you could murder
innocent people, didn't you?

246
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:53,875
Honestly, you're not
even human anymore.

247
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,835
You're a monster.

248
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,716
Well, come along.

249
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,470
Hold up. Mr. Danny,
wait a second!

250
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,366
I'm relieved that you
chose not to trust Mr. Inui.

251
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,161
How brave of you to place
your confidence in me, dear.

252
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,246
I certainly hope that
nothing he said back there

253
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,873
was remotely true.

254
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,167
Unfortunately, Mr. Danny,

255
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,962
I'm afraid, I don't
have faith in you anymore.

256
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,508
My firearm?
When did you take it?

257
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,136
[DANNY]
Ah, there it is.

258
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,972
I should've known that
George would pass it on to you.

259
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,601
I admit it.
Mr. Inui was correct.

260
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,353
I resorted to using microphones

261
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,564
and a listening device
to uncover its whereabouts.

262
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,609
But I only did it for the
sake of keeping you innocent.

263
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,528
To protect you!

264
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,154
Your father and I...

265
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,906
As you know,
everything we fought for

266
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,492
was in the name of justice.

267
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,828
The real enemy is overwhelming.

268
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,164
And it's one I must
fight all by myself.

269
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,084
It's the great shadow
that looms over this city.

270
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,879
The data that George
obtained was unmistakable proof.

271
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,924
It warned us of the
dangers of the Extended.

272
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,968
We could have used it for good

273
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,930
and crushed the Beruhren
Corporation once and for all!

274
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,517
Such power... In this necklace?

275
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,103
[DANNY]
Will you give it to me?

276
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,688
[ROSA]
But...

277
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,190
This must have been important.

278
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,986
Why would he have entrusted
it with me instead of with you?

279
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,320
After all,

280
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,532
it's obviously crucial
to your whole life's work.

281
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,493
[DANNY] Why, those are
my sentiments exactly.

282
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,829
I, too, wonder why he chose

283
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,290
to bring his beloved
daughter into this fight.

284
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,251
How I'd love to tell
him off right now!

285
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,046
Once again, I have to get
the short of end of the stick

286
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,632
all because of
your selfish father.

287
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,426
[gasps]

288
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,804
[ROSA pants]

289
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,139
[DANNY]
I'm still not quite certain

290
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,725
how that man ever
got a hold of the data.

291
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,479
[DANNY]
He was a coward for sure.

292
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,606
If only he hadn't
rejected my suggestion

293
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,692
of using the knowledge
to our fullest advantage.

294
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,569
He even planned to run away.

295
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,988
To take you and your
mother out of the country.

296
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,616
If we'd handed it over to
Spitzbergen, we could've

297
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:36,162
rid ourselves of those filthy
Extendeds once and for all.

298
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,622
We'd be lining our pockets

299
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,082
with the bountiful
fruits of our labor.

300
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,212
[DANNY]
You see, in the end,

301
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,673
I had no choice
but to take action.

302
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,344
Anyway, don't take
this personally.

303
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,932
'Cause at the end of the day,
this is all your father's fault.

304
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,185
So it was you.
You murdered them.

305
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,772
The car accident
was my handiwork, yes.

306
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:06,651
Those robotic arms,
however... not so much.

307
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,529
If anything, they've
protected you ever since.

308
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,491
[DANNY]
Though I have no idea why.

309
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,826
[DANNY]
I even had to hire that

310
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,454
meddling Resolver
because of them.

311
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,372
Well,

312
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,417
luckily your hatred for
his kind made things easier.

313
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,335
Though no one would trust

314
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,380
a man with a gun
for a head regardless.

315
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,843
[ROSA]
No. I'm such an idiot!

316
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,390
[DANNY]
Don't worry, dearie.

317
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:41,644
I know you despise the idea
of survival by extension,

318
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:45,189
so I'll make sure to
kill you nice and proper.

319
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,693
[ROSA gasps]

320
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,497
What a pain! It must've
hidden in the car!

321
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,748
[DANNY gasps]

322
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,392
Him again?! Ugh!
How'd he find us?!

323
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,067
[JUZO]
Eleven o'clock! That's his car.

324
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,695
[MARY gasps]
Look out! The train!

325
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,533
At this rate we're gonna
be blown to smithereens!

326
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,829
[JUZO]
Hold on tight, Mary!

327
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,515
[ROSA gasps]

328
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,565
[DANNY grunts]

329
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,443
[ROSA gasping]

330
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:20,076
‐‐[panting]
‐‐[footsteps]

331
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,873
[gasps]

332
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,459
[JUZO]
It's time to snuff out the ghost

333
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,337
that's been haunting
that poor girl.

334
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,716
A parting shot.
Just as requested.

335
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,428
No, wait! [groans]

336
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,849
[JUZO]
All right. Now let's see.

337
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,353
[JUZO] How the hell am
I supposed to get paid?

338
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,241
[JUZO] Is this under the
Security Bureau's jurisdiction?

339
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,868
Well as it currently
stands, yeah.

340
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,496
Though I'm sure the EMS
will take it away from us

341
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,040
once we get to the
investigating part.

342
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,960
In the meantime,
we'll take a good look.

343
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,211
We're talking about the murder

344
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:15,089
of a prosecutor
and his wife after all.

345
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,553
[MARY]
I did it!

346
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,180
I figured out how
to open the pendant!

347
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,476
This necklace contains a puzzle.

348
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,478
Now watch my fingers.
You just gotta spin it,

349
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,231
give it a twist,
turn, and presto!

350
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,405
It's some kind of
antique memory vessel.

351
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,158
Is this what the
thief was after?

352
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,952
So that's what it was. [gasps]

353
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:48,456
[JUZO] Really?
This dinky, little thing?

354
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,790
Hmm.

355
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,712
[JUZO] If this old thing is
more valuable than your life,

356
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,757
I bet it would fetch
a good price if I sold it.

357
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,591
[ROSA gasps]

358
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,761
Huh? Just what are you
trying to get at, Juzo?

359
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,849
[JUZO inhales]
All right, listen up people!

360
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:10,019
I've decided that I'm taking
this data as my reward!

361
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,021
[POLICE groaning]

362
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,273
Hey, keep it quiet, will ya?!

363
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,233
Why the hell did you do that?

364
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,236
That wasn't pleasant
for us regular folk!

365
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,197
[JUZO]
That okay with you, miss?

366
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,364
Help yourself.

367
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,074
I'm pretty sure I
would've gotten murdered

368
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,452
if you hadn't come to rescue me.

369
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,872
Anyway, I said such
vile things to you!

370
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,291
But you helped. Why?

371
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,295
[JUZO] It's simple.
You weren't my client, princess.

372
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,963
What?

373
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,633
[JUZO]
And besides...

374
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,844
...I was kinda curious
about giving exorcisms a try.

375
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,388
Had nothing to do with you.

376
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,268
[MARY] Don't let that face
fool you. He's an old softy.

377
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,229
Here.

378
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,897
Well then, let me know

379
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,233
if you ever plan on
getting an extension‐‐

380
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,527
safe, reliable,
and super badass.

381
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,612
That's my personal promise.

382
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,782
C'mon, Juzo! Wait up a second!

383
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,703
[ROSA] Maybe‐‐ Maybe
that's what was haunting me.

384
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,998
My own negative feelings
against the Extended.

385
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,127
[MARY] I wonder where
that left hand flew off to?

386
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,338
I think we should look for it.

387
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,387
Thanks so much.

388
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,599
[MARY]
Ugh, it's no use!

389
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,268
This thing is so
old and obsolete

390
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,563
that none of my tools can
extract the data properly!

391
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,606
[JUZO]
Well, son of a gun.

392
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,650
I know you took this
off that girl's hands

393
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,110
so she wouldn't
be targeted again.

394
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,362
That's why you announced
it to the entire world.

395
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,072
But if you can't
turn it into cash,

396
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,949
then that means
you played yourself!

397
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,536
How the heck are you gonna
pay for my maintenance fees?!

398
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:54,248
Did you ever find out anything
about that hands‐only Extended?

399
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,585
Not really. It disappeared
before we knew it.

400
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,545
It's a shame since
it was a rare model.

401
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,882
I'm pretty bummed I didn't get
to take a better look at it.

402
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,926
You know, this
might just be a hunch,

403
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,928
but I have a feeling
that Rosa's father

404
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,264
might've hired
it to protect her.

405
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,600
[JUZO]
It sounds like a long shot.

406
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,977
Either way we'll
never know for sure.

407
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,565
[MARY gasps]

408
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,485
[JUZO]
Thanks for the light, Tetsuro.

409
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,237
Sorry. Come again?

410
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,989
[JUZO]
Huh?

411
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,913
[JUZO yells]

...conclusion of the Great War.

00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,810
On the other hand,

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,230
there is concern about
increases in crime,

00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,358
particularly in the slum
district known as the‐‐

00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,071
[JUZO]
Yeah. No problem.

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,406
I'll head that way now.

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,686

Who the hell are you?

11
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,731
[GOON B grunting]
Bastard!

12
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,736
[GOONS groaning]

13
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,905
[GOON A]
We'll remember this, Resolver!

14
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,325
[JUZO] Can't say I will.
Don't come here again.

15
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,083
[JUZO] That eyesore blocks the
view no matter where you are.

16
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,501
After the great war,

17
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,254
two things changed
the landscape of the city.

18
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,382
First was the
Beruhren Corporation

19
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,385
which grew from the
military procurement boom.

20
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,679
It casts a long shadow.

21
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,139
Second was the emergence
of people who underwent

22
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,141
physical function extension

23
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,520
thanks to technology
developed by Beruhren.

24
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,146
We got a name for 'em.

25
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,399
Call them the Extended.

26
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,485
‐‐[JUZO] Wouldn't do that.
‐‐[CLIENT A gasps]

27
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,445
[JUZO]
Don't make me hurt a client.

28
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,573
Aww. Not even a squeeze?

29
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,785
The rumor is that trigger
on your head is your weakness.

30
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:22,786
Is it true?

31
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,788
[JUZO]
Just two things give me trouble:

32
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,832
Humidity and kids.

33
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,916
So?

34
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,918
[JUZO] The only ones
who can touch my trigger

35
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,963
are the ones
I've come to accept.

36
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:37,718
Thing is... I don't
plan on accepting anyone.

37
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,971
That's what you always say,
but I get the feeling

38
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,015
you're looking for someone
you can trust it with.

39
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,809
[JUZO]
Don't be stupid.

40
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,397
And next time, call before
you get yourself in trouble.

41
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,984
Since the war ended, those
folks don't have anywhere to go.

42
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,278
However, I can't
turn a blind eye

43
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,947
when they start
dealing drugs in my bar.

44
00:03:58,989 --> 00:03:59,823
Juzo!

45
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:00,657
[JUZO]
Hm?

46
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,117
Here's your payment.

47
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,411
Also, how about
a drink for the road?

48
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,204
On the house, of course.

49
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,332
[JUZO] Booze and dames
will make a man go mad.

50
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,253
[JUZO]
This is all I need.

51
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,547
Use the money and
get yourself looked at.

00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,757
[CLIENT A]
One last thing...

53
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,799
[JUZO]
Hm?

54
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,800
[CLIENT A]
Mwah!

[JUZO gasps]

56
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,013
[CLIENT A]
Don't get any ideas.

57
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,640
That was just a "thanks."

[JUZO gasping]

59
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,603
[JUZO]
Damn it.

60
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,897
Like I'd get the wrong idea.

61
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,025
[STREET VENDOR A]
Hey, Resolver!

62
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,568
I got some good parts in.

63
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,278
Look! Top of the line!

64
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,614
[JUZO] I see you're still
laundering for the Kyusei Group.

65
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,950
What's it matter?
This is still top of the line!

66
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,036
[JUZO]
My name's Juzo Inui.

67
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,582
I make a living resolving
problems involving the Extended.

68
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,460
That being said,
my services vary.

69
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,463
I take care of everything
from babysitting runaways

70
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,633
to negotiating peace
between rival gangs.

71
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,512
[ONLOOKER A]
I heard that a renegade Extended

72
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,847
kidnapped some
kid and booked it.

73
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,098
Another Extended?

74
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,975
Not only that, they're
saying that the person

75
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,978
who tried intervening ended up
getting shot through the head.

76
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,522
Oh, how terrible.

77
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,192
Even though the war's over with,
can't say this is much better.

78
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,443
[JUZO]
Amen to that.

79
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,695
‐‐[ONLOOKERS gasp]
‐‐His... His head.

80
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,780
It's a gun!

81
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:22,697
[ONLOOKER A]
Don't worry.

82
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,825
[ONLOOKER B]
That's the Resolver, Juzo.

83
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,451

84
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,744
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,872
[ONLOOKER C] It's all right.
Now, now. Be good.

86
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,634
[JUZO] What's a nun
doing at a crime scene?

Is that you, Juzo?

[JUZO]

90
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,780
I was certain that gun on
your head finally went off.

91
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,741
As your landlady, I've gotta
ask about those loud noises

92
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,411
I heard coming from
inside your office.

93
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,037
[JUZO]
Noises?

94
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,088
[JUZO] Would you
take a look at this mess?

95
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,174
I can barely pay
the rent as it is.

96
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,138
[JUZO]
If you've got business with me,

97
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,641
start over by the ringing
the doorbell first.

It hurts when someone

102
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,739
looking like you
reacts that way.

103
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,198
Huh?

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,577
The fuss outside‐‐
are you the culprit?

105
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,246
[EXTENDED A] No! I wasn't
responsible for that!

106
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,790
[JUZO]
Tell it to the Security Bureau.

107
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,668
[EXTENDED A]
Wait. You can't! Please!

108
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,129
I'm not a tool!

110
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,216
[JUZO]
What's that?

111
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,970
[EXTENDED A] I can't be

We know you got a

00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,480
[JUZO] They're fast.
I didn't call for 'em yet.

door or we'll break it down!

123
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,458
[JUZO] As you can see,
I'm in the middle of renovating.

124
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,586
My place is in no
condition for guests.

125
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,588
But we can talk right here.

126
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,426
The deal is we're chasing
after a renegade Extend

127
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,346
that abducted a kid
from a nearby orphanage.

128
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,973
People have died.

129
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,182
If you're hiding him in there,

130
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,351
you'll be charged
as an accomplice.

131
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,894
[JUZO]
Sadly...

132
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,815
[JUZO] ...I haven't
received anyone like that.

133
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,319
Say, pal, you're
an Over‐Extended.

134
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,279
That certainly changes things.

135
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,031
Seeing as you
got a license from

136
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,283
the Reconstruction
Administration...

137
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,410
...it'd be a shame if you

138
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,329
interfered with our
investigation and lost it.

139
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,914
You wouldn't want
that to happen‐‐

140
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,875
be considered
a violator of Extend Law.

Ya follow?

142

Now that we understand
each other, step a‐‐

143
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,672
[JUZO]
One problem.

144
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,260
[JUZO] Violating the
Extend Law is a serious crime.

145
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,054
I could be arrested
and taken apart.

146
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,598
In which case, I guess
it won't matter if

147
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,394
I break a few more
laws before that happens.

148
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,895
Well?

149
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,731
What do ya think?

[SECURITY HEAD A grumbles]

151
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,651
But, sir...

152
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,862
Let's search someplace else.

153
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,659
So you know, Beruhren has
an interest in this matter.

154
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,703
With them involved,
I wonder how much longer

155
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,873
you'll be able to cop
that attitude, gun head.

156
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,668
[SECURITY HEAD A]
Snubbed. Shit!

00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,338
[EXTENDED A]
Mr. Inui?

158
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,132
[JUZO]
We'll talk later.

159
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,385
[JUZO] The Security
Bureau is watching us.

160
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,137
And not hiding it.

161
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,848
[EXTENDED A]
They're all chasing after me?

162
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,101
[JUZO] We gotta find a way
to handle this situation first.

163
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,312
[EXTENDED A]
Why didn't you hand me over

164
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,397
to them when you had the chance?

165
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,695
[JUZO] The Security Bureau's
attitude burns my muzzle,

166
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,365
and long ago, someone
told me a story like yours.

167
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,328
[JUZO]
There's nothing more to say.

168
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,792
[EXTENDED A]
I'll keep them distracted.

169
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,918
[JUZO]
Hm?

170
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,505
[EXTENDED A] Please, he needs
to be taken somewhere safe.

171
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,050
I'm asking you to protect
the kid from those people.

172
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,720
When this is over,
I promise to pay you, so...

173
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,723
...Juzo Inui, I'm hiring you.

174
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,443
[JUZO]
All right. I'll take the job.

175
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,739
Besides, you already owe me
for breaking the window.

176
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,074
[EXTENDED A]
Thank you.

177
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:18,952
[SECURITY C]
I see him!

178
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,869
[SECURITY D]
Over there!

179
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,371
[SECURITY E]
After him!

180
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,544
[JUZO]
Mary.

181
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,712
I need to hide
someone for a while.

182
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,006
Let me use the usual place.

183
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,136
[JUZO]
Yeah, I know.

184
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,892
[JUZO]
Well, then... let's go.

185
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,117
[footsteps]

186
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,788
[JUZO]
Hm?

187
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,750
O Lord, you are merciful.

188
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,588
You must be the one
responsible for saving this boy.

189
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,715
His name is Tetsuro.

190
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,718
The poor child
was under the care

191
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,054
of the orphanage the
other sisters and I operate.

192
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,557
[JUZO]
Well, that's good to hear.

193
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,435
Guess I've got nothin'
to worry about, then.

194
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:29,606
I am sure it was God's will
that led us to meet tonight.

195
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,734
Now, if you'll hand him over.

196
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,819
[JUZO]
Huh...

197
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,113
Just one thing.

198
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,407
You must've been
worried about this kid

199
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,452
in order to come to
a place like this alone.

200
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,913
[KAREN gasps]

201
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,456
It was worth it.

202
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:50,001
I consider the boy
to be like a son to me.

203
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,632
[JUZO] How honorable...
that's what I'd like to say.

204
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,383
But there's a renegade
Extend out there

205
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,427
that's been killing people.

206
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,806
Kinda reckless, don't ya think?
Coming out here by yourself.

207
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,602
[JUZO] Then again,
I guess it depends on whether

208
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,731
the renegade Extend really was
the one that abducted this kid.

209
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,985
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

210
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,737
[JUZO]
That guy out there‐‐

211
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,199
he didn't kill anyone,
and you know it.

212
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,326
[KAREN gasps]
I swear by the Holy Father‐‐

213
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,245
[JUZO]
As for you, sister,

214
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,248
seems your God's a pretty
harsh disciplinarian,

215
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,583
especially when
it comes to kids.

216
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,043
Look at these legs.

217
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,713
The tendons have been cut
so he can't run away.

218
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,131
But even stranger,

219
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,010
you say you're a nun, but the
entire time we've been speaking,

220
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:45,056
you haven't looked away
once, despite how I look.

221
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,309
So... who are you really?

222
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,437
[sighs]

223
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,399
[KAREN] It's sad to hear you
talk about yourself like that.

224
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,733
[JUZO gasps]

225
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,404
I bet that intuition of yours
lands you in trouble often.

226
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,280
[JUZO]
Uhh...

227
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,906
[KAREN]
I mean, after all...

228
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,784
[JUZO gasps]

229
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,452
[KAREN]
I wouldn't be forced to kill you

230
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,455
if only you had handed
the kid over quietly.

231
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,500
[JUZO]
That emblem.

232
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,252
You're with Beruhren.

233
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,383
[JUZO] Aren't you trying
to take him back alive?

234
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,428
I will, as long as you don't
make any stupid moves.

235
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,140
And worst case scenario, I only
need him from the neck up.

236
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,433
[JUZO grunts]

237
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,061
[KAREN gasps]

238
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,447
[JUZO]
You've got skills.

239
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,074
I take it you
extended your eyesight.

240
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,201
And judging by your bloodlust,

241
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,828
the victim everyone
was fussing over

242
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,039
must've been caught
in your crossfire.

243
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:58,004
[KAREN] I've heard plenty
of stories about you.

244
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,255
Like how you're a product of

245
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,091
the Big Ships, Big Guns
Doctrine from the war.

246
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,887
The Over‐Extended that
served in the Gun Slave Unit.

247
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,349
I don't know how someone
like you got involved in this.

248
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,809
But trust me, what
you've stumbled into

249
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,520
is way beyond
a relic like you are.

250
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,105
If you wanna prove me wrong,

251
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,484
please, go ahead and fire
that magnificent gun of yours.

252
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,235
Wait. You can't.

253
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,238
Right. Without someone there
to pull the trigger for you,

254
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,115
you're absolutely nothing.

255
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,034
Just a useless tool.

256
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,995
Sorry, that was uncalled for.

257
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,250
As an apology, I'll make
your death quick and painless.

258
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:45,426
Oh? Are you all finished
playing hide‐and‐seek?

259
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,304
[JUZO]
Say that one more time.

260
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,555
[gasps]

261
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,227
[JUZO] Maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

262
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,647
I said tell me what I am!

263
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,191
Nothing more than
a relic of the past!

264
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,651
You think you stand a chance

265
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,653
against an agent of
the Beruhren Corp?

266
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,904
[EXTENDED A grunts]

267
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:05,988
[KAREN gasps]

268
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,783
[KAREN groans]

269
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,827
[JUZO]
What're you doin' here?

270
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,287
[EXTENDED A]
Juzo Inui, now's your chance!

271
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,372
Run!

272
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,126
[EXTENDED A]
Where are you aiming?

273
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,169
[EXTENDED A yelps]
My sub‐brain!

274
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,797
[JUZO]
She shot for the ricochet.

275
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,258
[KAREN panting]

276
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,719
You belong to us!
Your body is our property!

277
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,929
And in case you forgot,

278
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,889
here's the thing about
company property‐‐

279
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,434
it isn't allowed
to have free will!

280
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,393
[JUZO]
Don't shoot!

281
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,894
[EXTENDED A gasps]

282
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,364
[KAREN] Why are you going
out of your way to help him?

283
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,574
It's not like this mess

284
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,201
has anything to do
with you, Resolver.

285
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:56,831
[JUZO] I always finish
the job and protect my clients.

286
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,167
Especially when
I haven't been paid yet.

287
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,254
You're a funny guy,
but the joke's on you.

288
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,591
Both of you will
end up dying in the fall.

289
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,593
[JUZO] That'd prove
inconvenient for you as well,

290
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,927
I imagine.

291
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:15,057
Like I said, it doesn't
matter if he's alive or dead.

292
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,560
As long as we follow
the sewer system,

293
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,061
it shouldn't be difficult for us

294
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,273
to locate him and
recover his body.

295
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,276
[JUZO] I have no idea
what you need this kid for,

296
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,197
but like I said earlier,
I never leave a job unfinished.

297
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,160
[JUZO] He's yours for now,
but I'll be back for him.

298
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,870
Count on it.

299
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,373
[KAREN giggles] I look
forward to seeing you try.

300
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,463
[splash]

301
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,340
Now then...

302
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,510
...time for us
to go back home...

303
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,553
...Master Tetsuro.

304
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,896
[EXTENDED A]
Juzo Inui.

305
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,941
[EXTENDED A]
Wake up.

306
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,692
Juzo!

307
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,194
[JUZO gasps]

308
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,279
[JUZO coughs]

309
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,741
[JUZO yelling]
What the hell?

310
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,410
I gotta dry myself off!
I'm gonna rust, I'm gonna rust!

311
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,745
[EXTENDED A gasps]

312
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,084
[EXTENDED A]
Your head, it's spinning!

313
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,419
[BOTH scream]

314
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,213
[JUZO]
Huh?

315
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,925
Your body... You took
that hit to protect me.

316
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,179
[EXTENDED A]
Don't worry about that.

317
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,015
This form didn't have
much time left anyway.

318
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,520
[JUZO grunts]

319
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,273
[JUZO] Maybe you oughta
tell me what's goin' on.

320
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,483
Let's start with that crazy nun

321
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,736
and why she was after
this Tetsuro kid.

322
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,823
Also, given the way you
look, you oughta be dead,

323
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,199
but you're not.

324
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:01,831
[EXTENDED A] I was a prisoner
being held at a secret facility.

325
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,584
That nun is one
of the employees there.

326
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,671
[EXTENDED A] She's not
a real sister, of course.

327
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,841
They disguised their
headquarters as an orphanage,

328
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,467
but they were really
gathering orphans

329
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,469
to send over to Beruhren Corp

330
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,889
to be used as test subjects for
their extension experiments.

331
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,727
[EXTENDED A]
I'm one of their guinea pigs.

332
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,937
They installed
something in my body‐‐

333
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,566
Harmony, a device that can
control Extended remotely.

334
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,403
[JUZO] Hold on a sec! The
remote control of an Extended?

335
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,904
[EXTENDED A]
That's right.

336
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,740
The ability allows me
to operate a body

337
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,118
like this by force even when
I'm nowhere close to it.

338
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,039
[EXTENDED A] You're looking
at proof my story's true.

339
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,374
I took over this unoccupied
Extended body

340
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,753
with Harmony and used
it to escape the lab.

341
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,631
[EXTENDED A]
In other words,

342
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,799
the person you're
speaking with right now

343
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,969
is me, Tetsuro.

344
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,014
[JUZO] If that's legit,
this goes way beyond

345
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,600
just violating the Extend Law.

346
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,810
[TETSURO] Right. That's
why they were so frantic

347
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,064
to recover me before
I was discovered.

348
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,608
[TETSURO]
My existence could bring

349
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,653
the downfall of the
Beruhren Corporation.

350
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,280
[JUZO]
On any other day

351
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:20,868
I'd tell you there's no way
I'd buy a crazy story like that.

352
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,371
But after looking
at that shell of a head,

353
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,749
I've got no choice
but to believe.

354
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,001
Your body‐‐where is it?

355
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,505
[TETSURO] I feel vibrations,
like I've been

356
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,799
placed on a vehicle
of some sort.

357
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,386
I'm sorry I'm not more help, but
whenever Harmony is activated

358
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,429
most of my senses are cut off.

359
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,557
[TETSURO]
It doesn't matter.

360
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,476
I don't think this false
body can take the strain

361
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,853
of Harmony for much longer.

362
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,397
Looks like this is it.

363
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,273
I'll be their tool again.

364
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,318
[TETSURO]
I should've known.

365
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,696
It's impossible to
escape from Beruhren.

366
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,407
[TETSURO] In order
to focus Harmony's ability

367
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,909
and control an Extended body,

368
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,746
you have to have a strong desire
to move your own body parts.

369
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,208
[TETSURO]
To make me feel that way,

370
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,168
they took away my vocal cords,

371
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,422
and cut the tendons
in my arms and legs.

372
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,925
Even so, I still
managed to escape.

373
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,346
[TESTURO] I tried convincing the
people in the Security Bureau,

374
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,682
but they didn't
believe a word I said.

375
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,935
I just wanted freedom‐‐

376
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:32,732
to experience the feeling of
being able to walk around again.

377
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:37,570
Juzo Inui, you were the only
one who listened to my story.

378
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,116
[TETSURO] It's too bad
things had to end this way.

379
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:46,328
But you should know...
I'm glad to have met you.

380
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,633
[JUZO grunts]

381
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,429
[JUZO]
Damn it.

382
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,891
This is why I hate
humidity and kids.

383
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,733
[OPERATOR A]
Medication administered.

384
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:16,984
[OPERATOR B]
The subject's consciousness

385
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,069
and physical activity
have dropped.

386
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,738
[OPERATOR C] Sister Karen,
we have locked down

387
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,698
the activation of Harmony.

388
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,325
We'll begin the
transfer of Harmony

389
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,577
as soon as we arrive
at the facility.

390
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,829
Make sure the
preparations are complete

391
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,207
for an immediate procedure.

392
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,231
[JUZO]
Funke...

393
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,899
...Faust!

394
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,581
[JUZO]
I'm back for the kid I lent you.

395
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,790
[KAREN]
I can't believe you really came.

396
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,625
[MARY]
Don't tell me...

397
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,626
[CUNNINGHAM]
I continue to destroy

398
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,794
the things you
treasure one by one.

399
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,421
[MARY]
I told you, don't say my name!

400
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,549

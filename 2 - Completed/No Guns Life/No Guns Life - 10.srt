00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,944
[COLT'S SISTER A]
All this food is ours?

2
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,695
Can we really eat it all?

3
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,781
[COLT]
That's why I got it!

4
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,407
And pretty soon you'll‐‐

5
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,411
No. Starting tomorrow, you'll be
eating this good all the time.

6
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,039
It's only the best from now on.

7
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,875
[COLT'S SISTER A]
Starting...

8
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,502
[COLT'S SISTER B]
...tomorrow?

9
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,051
Yeah. Now, eat up.

10
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,604
Tomorrow. I promise.

11
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,205
[GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL A] We will
never forget the heroic actions

12
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,333
of the late Tokisada Mega Armed!

13
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,419
Or how they led our
country to victory!

14
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,802
Don't let them fool you!
Mega Armed is no hero!

15
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,844
‐‐[thud]
‐‐What're you doing?

16
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,137
[HENCHMAN A]
Come quietly.

17
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,264
But he was working
alongside Beruhren!

18
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,099
Not only that,

19
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,227
he was a suspect in a criminal
case from ten years ago!

20
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,061
I have proof!

21
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,396
[EMS OFFICER A]
Beruhren's private police

22
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,313
are getting cocky.

23
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,690
[PROTESTER A]
This is tyranny!

24
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,359
[EMS OFFICER A] What are they
even doing at a public event?

25
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,443
[EMS OFFICER B]
Ignore them.

26
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,488
We just need to
focus on doing our jobs.

27
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,325
[EMS OFFICER A] Yeah, otherwise
Kronen will chew us out.

28
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,417
[MARY sighs] Today's ceremony
is just for Beruhren

29
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,252
and important political figures.

30
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,547
Why would Colt be
hanging around here?

31
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,673
[TETSURO]
He definitely told me

32
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,426
to meet him at
the park at three.

33
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,095
[MARY grunts] So what're
we supposed to do then?

34
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,306
It's too bad we couldn't
use the transmitter.

35
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,725
[TETSURO]
What transmitter?

36
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,227
[MARY] The one in your pocket
you should've let him steal!

37
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,270
[TETSURO grunts]

38
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,815
[MARY] When Colt's around,
items tend to go missing.

39
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:55,485
He was acting weird yesterday,
so I planted a tracker.

40
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,030
[MARY] But I didn't
account for one thing:

41
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,741
You taking it back.

42
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,201
[TETSURO]
Sorry, I screwed up.

43
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,453
Nah, it's fine.

44
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,496
You thought you were helping
Colt stay out of trouble

45
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,332
and trying to get back
the property he stole from me.

46
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,084
It's kinda sweet.

47
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,754
This stinks.

48
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,713
No way!

49
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,799
I don't know why‐‐since I think
I took a shower two days ago.

50
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,803
Or the trash is the
culprit. Just a thought.

51
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,014
[MARY]
Yeah. I see your point.

52
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,517
We'll wait for our chance
and clear outta here.

53
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,894
[TETSURO]
You sure?

54
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,604
But he may be able
to shed some light

55
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,355
on your brother's whereabouts.

56
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,944
I can ask Colt about
Victor some other time.

57
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,822
Plus, we can't let
Beruhren find you here.

58
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,408
[TETSURO]
If that extension really was

59
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,285
made by your big brother,

60
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:50,040
then that means Victor
must have survived the war.

61
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,124
Who knows?

62
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,376
All the parts used in
that piece's construction

63
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,337
were available
while he was enlisted.

64
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,215
I can't be sure of anything yet.

65
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,718
But if my brother is alive
in the city somewhere,

66
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,764
I'll definitely find him.
I'll never stop looking.

67
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,352
We'll meet up with
Colt some other time.

68
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,394
Follow my lead.

69
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:15,106
They say there's no one more
cautious than an engineer‐‐ Uh!

70
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,274
[gasps]

71
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,946
[SECURITY EXTENDED A]
Trespassers spotted!

72
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,614
Commencing capture!

73
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,202
[SECURITY EXTENDED A]
What was that?

74
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,542
Are you...?

75
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,341
[TETSURO grunts]

76
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,385
Huh?

77
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,761
Don't tell me.

78
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:49,599
[TETSURO grunts] This body's
difficult to control!

79
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,560
[MARY]
I'm glad you saved us,

80
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,311
but taking over
some random Extended

81
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,856
before we've figured
out Harmony is reckless!

82
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,441
[TETSURO] Yeah, sure,
but more importantly,

83
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,652
what was that explosion?

84
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,157
[TETSURO gasps]
Wait a second.

85
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,742
It's Colt!

So you're Juzo Inui!

though I took good care of her.

00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,155
No! I swear it wasn't me!

108
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,557
[JUZO] Got some questions
regarding terrorism.

109
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,935
Specifically, the group
you're involved with.

110
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,397
That so? You mean
today's ceremony.

111

[JUZO]
Huh?

112
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,902
Look, I only acted
as the middleman.

113
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,570
My role was to arrange a meeting

114
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,448
between the kid and
Spitzbergen. That was it.

115
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,794
Looks like they're using
the train to evacuate.

00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,297

I‐It's you!

Tetsuro, while
I'm glad you made it,

120
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,516
you shouldn't have brought

121
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,935
[TETSURO]
Actually, I'm in here.

122
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,437
Huh? Okay. Back up.

123
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,439
Does that mean
you're controlling it?

124
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,816

That explosion‐‐

128
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,989
did you have something
to do with setting it off?

130
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,199

Yeah, that's right.

132
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,706
This is the job I mentioned.

133
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,791
If something happens
during the ceremony,

134
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,626
protocol is for the
Beruhren officials

135
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,254
to board the train
and depart for safety.

136
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,801
[COLT] A train that
happens to have a bomb on it...

137
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,846
...and this switch sets it off.

138
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,806
It's time to cut some branches.

139
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,517
Those huge trees have been
stealing all the nutrients,

140
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,436
leaving nothing for us!

141
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,937
I understand how you feel,

142
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,481
but what you're talking
about is straight up terrorism!

143
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,234
[COLT]
No need to worry, <i>médica</i>.

144
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,820
I'll make sure no
civilians get hurt.

[gasps]

146
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,783
[TETSURO] So that's how you
plan to support your loved ones?

147
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,453
With the money you earn
from murdering others?

148
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,872
[COLT] You explain
it to my family then!

149
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,458
How killing the rich
and corrupt is wrong,

150
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,251
but it's okay to let
them take everything

151
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,587
while we starve to death!

00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,924

My little sisters‐‐

153
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,052
neither of them understand.

154
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,597
The word "tomorrow"
is foreign to them.

155
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,809
They're not able to even imagine
what good a new day will bring.

[COLT]
Last time we met,

157
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,817
you asked me if this is
what I really wanted to do.

158
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,277
Yes, it is.

159
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,570
What I want

160
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,823
is to show 'em there's
a future waiting up ahead.

161
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,492
The cost doesn't matter.

162
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,578
I will do whatever it takes!

163
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,540
So do me a favor. Let go of me!

00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,578
[TETSURO groans]

176
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,335
[COLT] Seriously, though,
that body's a bad fit for you.

177
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,379
[TETSURO]
There's still time to turn back!

178
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,632
What'll happen to your family if
you're arrested as a terrorist?

179
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,509
Who will watch over them?

180
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,220
[COLT]
We're not getting caught.

181
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,765
I'll arm that bomb
by hand, then escape.

182
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,433
Both of us.

183
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,519
But first off...

184
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,147
...we should do something
about that guy.

185
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,030
[MID‐SECURITY A] Well?
Why didn't you capture him?

186
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,658
Are you forsaking your duties?

187
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,870
[TETSURO]
I'll distract him, Colt!

188
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,746
You make a run for it.

189
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,665
Good idea!

190
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,542
Think I'll take you up on it!

191
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,300
[TETSURO]
I won't let you!

192
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,968
[MID‐SECURITY A]
Traitor!

193
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,012
[COLT] Gotta be quick
and start the timer!

194
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,806
If he calls for backup,
it'll be hell!

195
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,104
[COLT]
Boom.

196
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,772
All done.

197
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,358
Now to go back
and help out Tetsuro.

198
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,776
[COLT gasps]

199
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,115
[MID‐SECURITY A]
Immigrant rat.

200
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:44,871
You were obviously enticed by
Spitzbergen and blinded by gold.

201
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:49,417
Repent, sinner,
for acting so capriciously!

202
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,586
[TETSURO]
Colt, I‐I'm sorry.

203
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,130
No. Tetsuro!

204
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,886
[COLT chuckles] So this
is how it's going to end.

205
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,722
I already set the
bomb timer though.

206
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,016
So if you try disarming it,

207
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,811
you can say goodbye to me,
you, and this whole train.

208
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,565
Once your suits die, my family
gets the money they're owed,

209
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,109
regardless of
what happens to me.

210
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,030
That's the only
thing that matters.

211
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,325
Letting my sisters see what
tomorrow can bring them!

212
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,495
[MID‐SECURITY A]
Though you received extensions

213
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,996
thanks to the company,

214
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:31,042
you stand against us and
lend yourself to terrorists.

215
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,754
You're nothing but
a lackey of Spitzbergen.

216
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:39,050
Pity for you, your targets
aren't even on this train.

217
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,553
[MID‐SECURITY A]
We knew the terrorists would

218
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,180
create some distraction near

219
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,849
the heavily guarded
ceremony ground.

220
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,434
Then during the commotion,

221
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,396
the evacuation train
would be targeted.

222
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,525
Therefore, we took precautions
and changed our plans.

223
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,027
While our prized officials
boarded the train,

224
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,364
we uncoupled their car
and left them at the station.

225
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,366
After that, we took
them somewhere safe

226
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,452
using an alternate
means of transportation.

227
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,579
No! You're lying!

228
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,914
[TETSURO gasps]

229
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:14,168
[MID‐SECURITY A] Huh. You're
free to think whatever you want.

230
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,629
Oh, one other thing.

231
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,800
Remember the people you saw
protesting outside the shrine?

232
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,303
And the innocent
choir of orphans

233
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,972
that sang during the ceremony?

234
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,309
What if I told you all
those unsuspecting people

235
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,020
were aboard this train?

236
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,106
After the world hears
how you murdered civilians,

237
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,067
they'll know the truth
about Spitzbergen.

238
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,571
How you're just butchers
without any motivation.

239
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,823
Meanwhile,
Beruhren will be propelled

240
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,368
into an even more
brilliant tomorrow!

241
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,870
[COLT grunts]

242
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,247
[MID‐SECURITY A] Release
the car with the explosives.

243
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,999
‐‐[HENCHMAN D] Sir!
‐‐[COLT] No, you can't!

244
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,127
Innocent people are going
to die! Are you insane?

245
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,628
[MID‐SECURITY A]
Proceed.

246
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,719
I've got to make this right.

247
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,346
[HENCHMEN groan]

248
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,271
[COLT] Enough time to
enter the code and disarm it!

249
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,898
‐‐[gunshot]
‐‐[COLT groans]

250
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,246
[TETSURO]
Colt...

251
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,254
[COLT groaning]

252
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,173
[COLT yells]

253
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,307
[COLT groans]

254
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,564
[COLT] My meds ran out
at a time like this?

255
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,364
[TETSURO grunting]

256
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,369
[MARY gasps]

257
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,157
[TETSURO groans]

258
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,705
[MARY] Hey, kid,
don't those burns hurt at all?

259
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,875
I didn't even notice them.

260
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,793
When did I...?

261
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,128
[MARY]
Never mind.

262
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,091
[MARY]
It was probably when...

263
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,886
[TETSURO] I‐I'm okay,
but how's Colt doing?

264
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,973
[MARY] They must've used
anti‐Extended rounds on him.

265
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,058
See how the bullets
went clear through?

266
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,480
If we don't get him to a
hospital soon, he's a dead man.

267
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,820
Damn! I was sure I was
a goner back there!

268
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,322
[TETSURO, MARY]
Don't do that!

269
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,407
So then it's not
as bad as it looks?

270
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,784
[COLT chuckles]
I didn't get maintenance

271
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,078
from you for nothing!

272
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,205
Not bad.

273
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,665
You're something else, Tetsuro.

274
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,336
Thanks to you, not a single
bystander ended up hurt.

275
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,214
Glad I invited you
along to help me out.

276
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,134
[TETSURO]
Thanks, but I'm not amazing.

277
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,344
This power is‐‐

278
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,888
Ah, so humble! I love this guy!

279
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,848
‐‐[TETSURO] Let go of me!
‐‐[MARY] Colt.

280
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,141
This extension‐‐

281
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,435
I need to know
where you got it from.

282
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,022
Damn, looks like
I've been found out.

283
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,106
[MARY]
Uh...

284
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:08,694
I stole it. Saw it on the black
market and couldn't resist.

285
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,071
Sorry, <i>médica</i>.

286
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,281
Oh. I see.

287
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,703
Look, I know I've caused a
whole bunch of problems today,

288
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,623
but could you maybe
control my legs for a while

289
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,833
and walk me back home?

290
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,669
I'm having some
problems standing.

291
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,504
That's cool, right, Tetsuro?

292
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,340
Thing is, his sub‐brain's
taken a beating

293
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,467
after everything
he's gone through.

294
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,220
This one time, please.

295
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,817
[COLT] When that old man with
the braids described the job,

296
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,902
I knew it was
too good to be true.

297
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,196
Should've trusted my gut.

298
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,658
Hey, what's up?

299
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,660
Don't feel much like talking?

300
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,663
Oh, I get it. Whenever you
take over someone else,

301
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,082
you aren't able to
speak anymore, right?

302
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,126
That's my bad.

303
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,920
Make a left. It's down here.

304
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,676
[COLT] By the way,
I meant what I said.

305
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,886
You are amazing.

306
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,223
But hey, don't think
I was talking about that‐‐

307
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,517
that power of yours.

308
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,731
You went out of your way to
help a guy you had just met.

309
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,108
Extensions didn't do that.

310
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,070
[COLT]
Don't get me wrong though.

311
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,199
Without that ability of yours,
I would have never gotten home.

312
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,212
I appreciate it, Tetsuro.

313
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,483
[JUZO]
The terrorist attack on Beruhren

314
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,778
ended in failure, Saryshagan.

315
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,614
Even if it was a success,
it would've only increased

316
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,908
discrimination
against the Extended.

317
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,409
If things went south,

318
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,286
they'd just need to
take care of the kid

319
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,830
and say he was acting alone.

320
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,667
Pretty selfish method,
don't you think?

321
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,795
[SARYSHAGAN] Heh. You really
can't see the big picture.

322
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,963
What do you think
is Spitzbergen's goal?

323
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,218
We're trying to eliminate
every last one of you Extended.

324
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,637
Let me assure you of one thing.

325
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,723
We're not gonna rest
until we've succeeded!

326
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,688
Yo.

327
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,980
[SARYSHAGAN]
Rosso?

328
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,402
[laughs] So the Security Bureau
was using you as a pawn!

329
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,905
They were holding the other
end of your leash, Extended!

330
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,827
[ROSSO] Hmph. First off,
I think you misunderstood.

331
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,994
I'm not here tonight

332
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,039
in my capacity as chief
of the Security Bureau,

333
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,542
and if I were, it's not
like we have jurisdiction

334
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,544
when it comes to
their kind anyway!

335
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,630
Still, because of all
the weapons and resources

336
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,757
you've supplied to Spitzbergen,

337
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,386
I ended up losing
a lot of family members!

338
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,265
And believe me, I'm gonna
make sure you pay for it!

339
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,933
[SARYSHAGAN grunts]

340
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:30,646
Well, Gun Head,
it looks like I owe you one.

341
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,190
[JUZO] The Security Bureau
doesn't owe me anything.

342
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,817
[ROSSO]
Tch.

343
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,027
[JUZO]
One last thing, Saryshagan.

344
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,699
Before, you said I looked
exactly the way he described me.

345
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,285
Who were you talking about?

346
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,911
Give me a name.

347
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,581
[SARYSHAGAN laughs]

348
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,915
[SARYSHAGAN]
Sorry, I just thought

349
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,085
you would've
figured it out by now.

350
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:57,047
After all,
you must remember Victor.

351
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,716
[JUZO gasps]

352
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,969
[JUZO]
Victor? Can't be.

353
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,973
[SARYSHAGAN] By the way, said he
couldn't wait to see you again!

354
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,850
[SARYSHAGAN laughs]

355
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,585
[JUZO]
Huh.

356
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,729
[PEPPER] Sure took your time.
I was losing my patience.

357
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,567
[JUZO] Sorry, but
I'm closed for the night.

358
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,779
Have a heart, or did
they take that as well?

359
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:30,200
What about my wish?
Aren't you going to grant it?

360
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,454
Or am I going to
have to order you to?

361
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,539
[JUZO]
That right arm.

362
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,791
[SEVEN] The only one who
can give me orders is Pepper.

363
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,126
[SUISO] Guess I was
the one who was wrong.

364
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,796
[PEPPER] Bad news, it looks
like I've fallen for you.

365
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:46,926

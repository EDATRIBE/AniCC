00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,220
[JUZO]
My name is Juzo Inui.

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,056
I resolve problems
involving the Extended.

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,892
That's why folks call
me the Resolver.

4
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,895
Recently, this kid,
Tetsuro, needed my help.

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,231
I took him to see Mary,
an extension engineer

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,692
in my part of town,
the Kyusei Pit.

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,988
After I refused an offer from
Huang, a higher up in the mob,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,244
Tetsuro used a technology known
as Harmony to take over my body.

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,581
Honestly, this situation
snubs my barrel.

10
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,041
Listen.

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,377
They said they'd change
your body back to normal.

12
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,922
But before they do, we have to
finish the job we were assigned.

13
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,632
The company has no use for gears

14
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,300
that do not fulfill
their assigned role.

15
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,635
[gasps]

16
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,762
[TETSURO]
These are children!

17
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,139
Not soulless gears!

18
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,111
[ANNE]
But how? You should be dead.

19
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,782
[ANNE]
Did the poison not work on you?

20
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,701
[TETSURO] Yeah, it did,
but I guess this body

21
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,746
has some sort of
built‐in resistance to it.

22
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,456
I am a little numb, though.

23
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,501
[CUNNINGHAM] One of those
wretched Kyusei Extended?

24
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,797
So unaware, you didn't even
realize you were being followed.

25
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,384
My goodness. You couldn't
be more useless if you tried.

26
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,218
[snaps]

27
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,011

30
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:14,027
[CUNNINGHAM laughing]

31
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,488
[CUNNINGHAM]
Juzo Inui!

32
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:26,248
[laughs] It appears you've made
me eat my words from before.

33
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,125
You've proven to be
some unexpectedly

34
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,711
useful gears after all.

35
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,255
What a pleasant surprise.

36
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,549
Lucky for you, our
company rewards those

37
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,092
who can demonstrate their worth.

38
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,343
[ANNE gasps]

39
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,682
Anne.

40
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,935
This will be your final
chance to do just that.

41
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,479
Disassemble this
overgrown peashooter

42
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,523
and we'll allow you to live.

43
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,608
A faulty gear can
gum up the works

44
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,861
and wreak havoc on
an entire production.

45
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,904
Prove your worth
right here and right now

46
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,158
and you can be a part of our
efficient machinery once again.

47
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,076
What? You want us to fight?

48
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:06,163
But using her power
again will kill her!

49
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,750
[ENDE]
Anne.

50
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,668
Please don't worry.

51
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,588
I'll be fine, I swear.

52
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,925
Because your embrace
will hold me together.

53
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,636
[ANNE]
Ende!

54
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,227
Oh, no.

55
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,486
[gasps]

56
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,779
[TETSURO]
Wait!

57
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,617
[TETSURO]
Stop this!

58
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,202
Listen to me!

59
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,705
Don't you realize you're being
used by some heartless company?

60
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,208
Is that what you really
want for yourselves?

61
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,960
You don't have any idea
what you're talking about!

62
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,005
All you're doing is
shooting your mouth off!

63
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,007
We wanna survive.

64
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,593
And if somebody else
gets hurt along the way,

65
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,137
then too bad for them.

66
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,014
We do whatever
the company tells us

67
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,517
because that's
just how life works!

68
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,643
Ya see?

69
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,145
It's self‐preservation,
so if we wanna keep on living,

70
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,730
then we have no other choice!

71
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,774
[TETSURO groans]

72
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:16,942
[TETSURO gasps]

73
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,902
[gasps]

74
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,445
[TETSURO]
Oh, no!

75
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,157
[CUNNINGHAM]
Well, what do we have here?

76
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,743
Master Tetsuro.

77
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,747
Has the little troublemaker
been with you this entire time?

78
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,707
No. Wait a tick.

79
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,669
I think I know what's
really going on here.

80
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,379
The boy's not just with him.

81
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,924
I believe he's actually
controlling Juzo Inui.

82
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,927
Master Tetsuro, is that you?

83
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,973
It's amazing.
He's using Harmony!

84
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,351
Oh, my! [chuckles]

85
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,437
So many surprises today!

86
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,731
You didn't have to do
all this for us, you know.

87
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,942
Not only did you render
our biggest nuisance

88
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,319
and your only
protector powerless‐‐

89
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,114
you served him
to us on a platter.

90
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,408
No matter how
powerful a tool may be,

91
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,619
it becomes a blunt instrument
in the hands of a child.

92
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,621
Actually, it's more
like he's become the rope

93
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,331
you're using to hang yourself.

94
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,417
[CUNNINGHAM chuckling]

95
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,879
Master Tetsuro, despite
all your protesting,

96
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,090
you've proven to be just
another tool as well.

97
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,304
[TETSURO]
I got too cocky.

98
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,098
I thought if I just
took over Juzo's body,

99
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,309
I could solve my problems.

100
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,020
I thought all I needed
was physical strength.

101
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,147
But I can't ignore it anymore.

102
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:42,068
The fact is, deep down,
I'm a weak person.

103
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,570
It's like Juzo said...

104
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,447
[CUNNINGHAM]
Hmm?

105
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,781
[TETSURO]
...achieving justice without

106
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,451
putting your life on
the line is a pipe dream.

107
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:55,290
[TETSURO] Even so, I still
wanna save those children.

108
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:59,210
I won't stop doing what's
right‐‐what I believe in.

109
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,005
That's the only way to
prove I'm my own person.

110
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,466
That I am not a tool!

111
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,844
[ANNE grunts]

112
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:12,641
Ha! You're nothing but a child
spouting off utter nonsense.

113
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,602
And this Gun Slave Unit
is a worthless hunk of trash

114
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,854
with a child using
it as their puppet.

115
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,274
Girl, why are you just
standing there slack‐jawed?

116
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,527
Go and secure that
boy's body at once!

117
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,946

118
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,038
[ANNE]
Don't take it personally.

119
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,624
We're only doing
this to survive.

120
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,418
But, Anne...

121
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,131
So what?

122
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,095
[ANNE] What's wrong with being
a tool for others, anyway?

123
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,557
'Cause free will is completely
meaningless in this world.

124
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,936
We really don't have
a choice in what happens!

125
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,732
Shit! Damn it to hell!

126
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,527
Ende, do it.

127
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,946
Hurry up and kill him already!

128
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,157
If you don't, you know
what'll happen to us.

129
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,826
[ANNE crying]

130
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,744
[ENDE]
Anne. I'm lost.

131
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,287
[ANNE gasps]

132
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,249
Anne.

133
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,335
Please hold my hand.

134
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,255
Ende.

135
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,343
[ENDE]
These aren't my arms.

136
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,471
[ENDE]
This isn't my body!

137
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,390
Where did I go?

138
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,435
Please, Anne. I need your help.

139
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,729
Please tell me where I am.

140
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,190
I'm lost, Anne. Where am I?

141
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,027
[ANNE] Remember what
that fake Sister told us?

142
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,113
To hold hands.

143
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,282
That way we won't get lost,

144
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,535
and we'll still be
connected to one another.

145
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,456
I promise I'll always
hold your hand, Ende.

146
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:03,710
So you'll never get lost,
and I'll never lose you.

147
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,262
[gasps]

148
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,730
[TETSURO groans]

149
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,441
[gasps] Ende!

150
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,862
[CUNNINGHAM] I'm sick
of all these childish games.

151
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,948
I gave you two a second chance
out of the goodness of my heart

152
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,867
and you've just wasted it.

153
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,537
I'm extremely disappointed
in both of you.

154
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,165
And since showing you
mercy didn't seem to work,

155
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,167
I had to resort to
more extreme means

156
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,253
and force your disobedient
hands to do my bidding.

157
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,588
[ANNE]
Ende!

158
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,965
Hang in there! Please, Ende!

159
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,801
[CUNNINGHAM]
I didn't kill her, per se.

160
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,010
The drug I shot her with

161
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,846
will put her brain
into a comatose state.

162
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,433
[gasping]

163
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,309
Ende.

164
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,602
[CUNNINGHAM]
What little self‐awareness

165
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,563
she once possessed will
now be gone completely.

166
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,940
That was the only
thing in the way

167
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,025
of total compliance, after all.

168
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,027
She'll keep up the
attacks as she's been doing

169
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,697
and simply go berserk until
her sub‐brain fizzles out.

170
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,658
Those primitive
Kyusei Extendeds won't

171
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,576
have a snowball's chance in hell

172
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,871
of stopping a cutting‐edge
model like Ende.

173
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,289
This will give us
the opportunity

174
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,833
to swoop in and save the day,

175
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,335
and for that, they
will owe us dearly.

176
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,419
[TETSURO]
Why?!

177
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,631
Couldn't you just take me back
instead of hurting more people?

178
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,259
Did you forget
our chat, Mister Inui?

179
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,428
Oh. I suppose I'm
talking to Tetsuro.

180
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,098
Anyway, I told the owner
of that body you're in now

181
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,683
what I planned to do.

182
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,185
That bit by bit
and little by little,

183
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,729
I would destroy
everything he cares about.

184
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,064
[TETSURO]
What?

185
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,316
[CUNNINGHAM] So my goal was
not to simply capture you

186
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,735
here and be done
with it. Oh, no.

187
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,029
That pistol‐headed
freak made a fool of me,

188
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,531
so I'm staying true to my word

189
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,576
and slowly crushing
every support he has.

190
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,871
I can't stop doing that
before I'm done, now can I?

191
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,206
Besides, you've caused
quite a bit more trouble

192
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,167
than you can handle,
so sooner or later

193
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,378
they're going to run you
out of the Kyusei Pit.

194
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,547
When that happens,
it's only a matter of time

195
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,049
before you get
snatched up again.

196
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,593
But until then I will sit back

197
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,219
and relax in my
comfortable perch

198
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,681
while I enjoy watching you
panic and flail about in vain.

199
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,893
Hang on! You're just
gonna leave us down here?

200
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,062
[ENDE]
Anne.

201
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,023
Anne.

202
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,733
Where are you?

203
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,735
[ANNE]
I'm here, Ende!

204
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm right here!

205
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,114
Run.

206
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,908
No. [gasps]

207
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,367
[TETSURO]
Watch out!

208
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,870
[ANNE yells]

209
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,040
[BOTH groan]

210
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,422
[grunting]

211
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,220
[TETSURO]
What do I do?

212
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,181
I can't use Juzo's
body very well.

213
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,142
But still, I've gotta try.

214
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,811
I have to find some
way to stop her.

215
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,272
I have to do something!

216
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,149
[ANNE] Do you know
how pathetic you are?

217
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,692
[gasps]

218
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,446
[ANNE] I can see the
dead ring on your neck.

219
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,198
You got it from
trying to control

220
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,992
that gun head, didn't you?

221
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:27,163
At this rate, your sub‐brain
is gonna fry pretty soon.

222
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,586
Can you do something for me?

223
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,297
Please save Ende.

224
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,466
I can't do it.

225
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,135
I need your help.

226
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:46,057
She doesn't deserve this.
She didn't do anything wrong.

227
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,892
It was all my fault.

228
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,187
I made her do everything.

229
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:55,024
Ende. I'm sorry.

230
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,694
I'm too weak.

231
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,822
I let go of you.

232
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,915
[TETSURO]
There's only one way.

233
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,752
[TETSURO]
But I can stop her.

234
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:40,486
[ENDE screaming]

235
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,746
[TETSURO]
Harmony's power has dropped.

236
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,290
I can't control her whole body.

237
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:57,503
If that's the case, maybe
I can take over one arm.

238
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,590
I gotta destroy her sub‐brain!

239
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,303
[ENDE screaming]

240
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,014
[TETSURO]
Come on! One more hit!

241
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,810
[groans]

242
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,405
[ENDE]
Anne, where are you?

243
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,449
I'm so scared!

244
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,451
Please hold my hand.

245
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:32,121
Or else, I'll... Anne, please!

246
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,456
Save me!

247
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:37,960
[ENDE wailing]

248
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,838
[TETSURO grunts]

249
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,134
'Cause free will is
completely meaningless.

250
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,387
[TETSURO]
But that's not true!

251
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,180
We do whatever
the company tells us

252
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,474
because that's
just how life works!

253
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,726
[TETSURO]
Your lives mean more than that!

254
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,686
Can you do something?

255
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,732
Save Ende. I can't do it.
I need your help.

256
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:04,237
[TETSURO] I'm not gonna let
all of this be for nothing!

259
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,708
[TETSURO]
Juzo.

260
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,630
[JUZO] Pretty strange riding
shotgun in my own body.

261
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,801
But still, I could see
everything that happened.

262
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,804
It's like my legs and arms
were moving on their own,

263
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,306
even though I was conscious.

264
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,935
Jeez. You really are
a crazy kid, ya know?

265
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,397
We're gonna have to have a nice
long talk when this is over.

266
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,233
That means you're gonna
have to listen for once.

267
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,610
[JUZO groans]

00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,280

[JUZO] This fight isn't
settled yet, though.

272
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,764
[JUZO] I know you can't
use Harmony right now.

273
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,224
So what the hell
are you gonna do

274
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,143
since you can't
move on your own?

275
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,562
You wanna try and use
me like a tool again?

276
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,106
Is that the only way you can
think of to clean up your mess?

277
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:22,982
Huh?

278
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,609
[TETSURO grunts]

279
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,028
[JUZO] I mean, when you
stop and think about it,

280
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,863
didn't you do pretty
much the same kinda thing

281
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,948
Beruhren does on
a smaller scale?

282
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,408
[TETSURO gasps]

283
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,828
[JUZO] You used me because
it was convenient for you.

284
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,331
Like I was just a tool
to get what you wanted.

285
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,249
[TETSURO grunts]

286
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,209
[elevator dings]

287
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,710
[JUZO] I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt

288
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,128
you didn't meant it that way.

289
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,632
But that's what using
Harmony on someone really is.

290
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,218
[MAILMAN A]
Ah! He's got a gun for a head!

291

[TETSURO groans]

292
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,722
[JUZO]
So think about that quietly

293
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,098
while ya hide
in here for a bit.

294
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,600

00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,604
[JUZO]
Huh?

00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,482
Wh‐What the hell are you doing?

00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,067
[TETSURO grunting]

298
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,403
[JUZO] There's only
so much whining I can take!

299
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,155
[TETSURO]
Listen, Juzo.

300
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,783
You're the one who told
me to act like a kid!

301

[JUZO grunts]

302
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,619
[JUZO]
If you're a punk kid,

303
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,747
then try acting
like it for a change!

[JUZO]
Damn it.

310
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,142
You really are a
major pain in the neck.

311
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,313
[JUZO] Don't use
Harmony anymore, okay?

312
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,983
Besides all that other stuff,
it'll fry your brain.

313
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,402
‐‐[scuttling]
‐‐[gasps]

314
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,904
[JUZO] She'll catch up
with us any moment now.

315
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,743
[JUZO]
Look.

316
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,288
Don't forget it's your
fault I'm so beat up.

317
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,707
And since I'm not
a hundred percent right now,

318
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,793
we're running out
of options to stop her.

319
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,005
I'm all outta smokes, too.

320
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,716
There's about a 90 percent
chance she'll die,

321
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,593
but I want you to
try your absolute best

322
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,263
to aim for just her
body extensions.

323
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,057
And then... pull my trigger.

324
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,559
[gasps]

325
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,227
[TETSURO]
But if I do that,

326
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,980
I'd be killing her
with my own hands.

327
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,236
[JUZO] If you really wanna
do what you believe is right,

328
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,780
no matter what anybody
else may tell ya,

329
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,949
you've gotta show some resolve!

330
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,370
Save Ende. I can't do it.

331
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:46,250
[ENDE screaming]

332
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,126
[TETSURO]
Yeah.

333
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,463
I really need to
wipe my own ass for once.

334
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,758
[TETSURO]
You were right all along, Juzo!

335
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,927
[ENDE screams]

336
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,329
[JUZO]
Well, damn.

337
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,375
I guess my days of trying to lay
low in the Kyusei Pit are over.

338
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:32,880
[JUZO] But thanks to Huang,
at least Mary wasn't kicked out.

339
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,548
Hate to break it to ya, kid.

340
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,592
In the eyes of
the Beruhren Corp,

341
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:40,513
you've graduated
from prey to enemy.

342
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,807
Don't you dare forget that.

343
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,728
[JUZO] The "poison"
from that poor Ende kid‐‐

344
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,939
it was like a special code

345
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,025
that paralyzes the
sub‐brain of an Extended.

346
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,530
Lucky for me, it wasn't designed
to work on tech as old as mine.

347
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,119
[JUZO] Anyway, Mary's
gonna make a counterprogram.

348
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,371
I'm not the most optimistic guy,

349
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,082
but I think she can
help those kids...

350
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,418
...even that girl, Ende.

351
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,718
[TETSURO]
Be honest.

352
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,469
You could've resisted Harmony

353
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,139
and taken back control
whenever you wanted.

354
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,515
Am I right?

355
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,310
[TETSURO] So you were actually
letting me control you.

356
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,359
[JUZO] No wonder
Beruhren is so desperate

357
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,737
to get their claws
into you again.

358
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,949
Do you know how hard it
was just to move my arm?

359
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,493
Which reminds me...

360
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,955
[TETSURO gasping]

361
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,292
[JUZO] I'm gonna say
this as clearly as I can.

362
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,297
[JUZO] Don't you ever think
about using Harmony on me again!

363
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,048
I helped you out this time

364
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,011
because that's the job
you hired me to do.

365
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,429
But the only people
that are allowed

366
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:07,349
to touch my trigger are
the ones I've accepted.

367
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,687
And I don't plan on accepting
anybody, you understand?

368
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,066
[JUZO] Walk the rest
of the way yourself.

369
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:23,073
[TETSURO grunts] Well, I don't
wanna go through that again!

370
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,326
Because walking around
with that head cannon

371
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,454
is like being a
magnet for trouble!

372
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,706
[JUZO]
What did you say?

373
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,416
[TETSURO] And you have
a big 'ol nasty wart

374
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,751
or something on
your left butt cheek!

375
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,295
Haven't you heard of a
little concept called privacy?

376
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,963
I went through all
that crap for you

377
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,423
and this I what I get in return?

378
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,008
[TETSURO] And your big
toe on your right foot...

379
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,760
[JUZO yells]

380
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,479
[OLIVIER]
You've really done it now.

381
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:57,358
I assume you know what
this means, don't you?

382
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,821
Things just got more
complicated, Juzo.

383
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,706
[MARY] Isn't EMS
finding out a bad thing?

384
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,665
[JUZO]
Calm down.

385
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,834
Just stay quiet and wait, okay?

386
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,713
[TETSURO]
You gotta save us, Juzo!

387
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,467
[JUZO]
<i>No Guns Life</i> Episode Five:

[JUZO] You walked off with the

this child was safely
returned to the facility.

That you wanna
walk around freely.

you were glad to have met me?

likely an act of terrorism

I don't mind.

138
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,449
Beruhren will think twice

140
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,954

142
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,962
[JUZO] The new gear, it's
called "Harmony" or something.

143
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,589
What is it?

144
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,050
[MARY]
Well, ya see...

145
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,553
...Extended were created during
the war, as you already know.

146
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,556
The intention was to boost
a soldier's strength for combat

147
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,975
by augmenting
their physical form.

148
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,394
To reduce the load
on the normal brain,

149
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,980
auxiliary sub‐brains
were installed to be able

150
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,775
to control all metahuman
functionality.

151
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,403
[MARY] With it, an Extended
can move extensions that

152
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,113
follow certain
programmed actions

153
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,657
without giving
complicated commands.

154
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,909
[JUZO]
I see.

155
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,202
You gotta be kidding me!

156
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,371
With a head like that,
how could you not know this?

157
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,708
[JUZO]
I had a general idea...

158
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,879
...but as a Resolver,
that's all I needed to know.

159
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,841
Think of extensions the
same way you would a vehicle.

160
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,094
The sub‐brain is
the driver's seat,

161
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,263
and the Extended's
will is the driver.

162
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,848
[JUZO]
That's why when the sub‐brain,

163
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,851
or as you call it, the
driver's seat, is destroyed,

164
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,104
the Extended can
no longer function.

165
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,439
Most old models like you
who were constructed

166
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,441
during the war have
internal sub‐brains.

167
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,986
Meaning the likelihood of them
being targeted is minimal.

168
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,532
But while we're on the subject,
where is yours located?

169
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,533
[JUZO]
Who knows?

170
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,743
It's fine if you
don't wanna tell me.

171
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,453
Just remember, whenever you die,

172
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,539
I'll be sure to dissect
your body thoroughly

173
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,499
and find out for
myself. Sound good?

174
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,542
[JUZO]
Hey, now.

175
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,336
[MARY]
Anyway, it's only a theory, but

176
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,798
I suspect this Harmony device
probably allows another driver

177
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,718
to force their way into
somebody else's driver's seat.

178
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,972
But to do that, you need
authentication codes‐‐

179
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,682
three of them.

180
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,978
One from the user, the
manufacturer, and finally, EMS.

181
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,190
[MARY] There're rumors floating
around of some master key

182
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,693
that could bypass all the codes.

183
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,861
Thing is,

184
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,573
this device has the potential to
ruin the Beruhren Corporation.

185
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,492
Why would they make something
like that themselves?

186
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,412
[JUZO] Can you safely
remove it from his body?

187
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:06,374
[MARY] Mm... The implant goes
up to his medulla oblongata,

188
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,126
so taking it out could leave him

189
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,295
with some permanent
brain damage.

190
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,046
Seems like whoever installed it

191
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,383
didn't care whether
or not he lived or died.

192
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,136
Makes me think maybe he
doesn't have any parents.

193
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,722
You don't suppose
this kid's an orphan?

194
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,602
[JUZO]
How am I supposed to know?

195
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,771
Something bothering you, Juzo?

196
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,941
Huh? Wait. Did you
switch cigarette brands?

197
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,818
[JUZO]
It's not like I wanted to!

198
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,445
Uhh...

199
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,114
[laughing]

200
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,241
You're joking! You're
pissed off because

201
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,118
you can't smoke your
favorite cigarettes?

202
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,288
You're so big, but you
act like a little kid!

203
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,833
You go for Tanegashimas, right?

204
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,002
Pretty sure you left a pack
behind here a while back.

205
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,212
[JUZO]
You have some?

206
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:56,758
Oh. I threw them out the other
day, now that I think about it.

207
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,759
[JUZO]
You what?

208
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,512
Well, whaddaya expect? It's
not like I'm a smoker, jeez.

209
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,390
And besides, if I had cigarettes
that strong lyin' around,

210
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,602
my patients might start to
get the wrong idea about me.

211
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,020
You probably don't realize it,

212
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,022
but a lot of them
come here just to flirt.

213
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,650
I can't afford to have
a scandal on my‐‐

214
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,321
So like I was saying, it's
absolutely no problem for me

215
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,281
to install limb
and vocal extensions

216
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,491
that'll be good
enough to support

217
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,867
his day‐to‐day functions,

218
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,411
but I can't do anything
until he wakes up.

219
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:30,959
[JUZO] Roger that. When he comes
around, call me at the office.

220
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,835
[MARY] It's unusual for
you to stay involved

221
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,965
with a case this long.
The job's finished, y'know?

222
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,260
You're not planning on making
him your partner, are you?

223
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,181
Oh! I'm only saying everybody
knows how Gun Slave Units

224
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,100
are supposed to
work in teams of two!

225
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,936
Well, the general public may
not be aware of that fact,

226
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,479
but to anyone on my
level, it's common‐‐

227
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,481
[JUZO]
Take good care of him, Mary.

228
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,985
[MARY]
Huh?

229
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,736
[MARY grunts]

230
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,699
Seriously, would it kill
him to get a sense of humor?

231
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,416
[JUZO] Can't believe
no one has my brand.

232
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,918
Talk about being out of luck.

233
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,134
[TETSURO]
Please! I'm not a tool!

234
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,845
[SUISO]
You're not my tool.

235
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,639
And certainly not
command center's.

236
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:31,060
What you wanna do is
for you to decide, Juzo.

237
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:36,441
[JUZO]
It won't happen again. Never.

238
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,319
Shit! These aren't
doing anything for me.

239
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,571
I need Tanegashima!

240
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,739

00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,910

[JUZO]
You gotta be kiddin' me!

Don't tell me
the damn thing's stuck!

You're comin' down
to the Security Bureau!

[JUZO]
Hold on! I bought those!

[SECURITY B]
Save it, pal.

255
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,200
[JUZO]
I properly paid for 'em!

00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,078
It's the vending
machine's fault!

I believe you're Juzo Inui, yes?

259
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,295
[CUNNINGHAM] Thank you
for your hard work, gentlemen.

260
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,298
You may return to
your usual duties now.

‐‐[SECURITY A] Sir!
‐‐[SECURITY B] Right.

262
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,515
[JUZO] Looks like you had
business with me from the start.

263
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,558
Name: Juzo Inui‐‐

264
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,811
an Over‐Extended who
received augmentation

265
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,689
courtesy of the military during
the days of the Great War.

266
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,902
Your hobby is housecleaning.
Dislikes: Children and humidity.

267
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,656
No family or memories of life
prior to your extensions.

268
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,617
After the war ended, you began
living in a one‐room apartment

269
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,537
owned by your landlord,
Christina Matsuzaki,

270
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,955
where you currently
make a living

271
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,834
resolving Extended‐related
problems. Heh.

272
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,794
However, it appears
you haven't been

273
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:23,798
properly compensated for the
last few jobs you've taken on.

274
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,428
I'm curious, how's the
window repair coming along?

275
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,056
[JUZO] It seems you looked
into my past pretty thoroughly.

276
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,977
So how 'bout you try telling me
something I don't already know?

277
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:41,482
[JUZO] For instance, let's
start with the Tetsuro kid.

278
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,318
Just who the hell is he?

279
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,404
[CUNNINGHAM] You misunderstand.
I'm here on behalf of

280
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,906
the Beruhren Corporation
to negotiate.

281
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,200
Please, call me Cunningham.

282
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:54,245
The boy is a very
valuable product of ours.

283
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,746
And as his rightful owners,

284
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,624
we would appreciate him
being returned to us.

285
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,585
We have a general
idea of his location,

286
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,671
but it seems he's in
a rather tricky area.

287
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,465
We'd like to resolve
this situation

288
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,383
as peacefully as possible.

289
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:11,929
Help us and you'll see,
we can be quite generous.

290
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:13,973
[JUZO grunts]

291
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,683
[CUNNINGHAM chuckles]

292
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,018
[JUZO gasps]

293
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,520
[CUNNINGHAM] Tanegashima
cigarettes for the Extended.

294
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,189
I can be so forgetful.

295
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,233
Remind me, that is your
favorite brand, isn't it?

296
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:28,696
We've been busy collecting all
the Tanegashimas in the city.

297
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,449
If you're smart and decide
to accept our proposal,

298
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,076
then the entire box
can be yours.

299
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,746
In order to reduce the stress
on their nervous system,

300
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,374
Extended rely on sub‐brains
to help carry the weight.

301
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,919
However, depending on the
degree of the extensions,

302
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,922
wear and tear on the nervous
system may not be prevented‐‐

303
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,257
thus, many Extended
choose to routinely use

304
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,843
"medicine" to suppress
the side effects.

305
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,388
One example being
these cigarettes.

306
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,016
However, the amount of sedative
contained in this brand

307
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,394
is far greater than
anything else on the market.

308
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,980
But there aren't many
who habitually use them,

309
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,983
so they were easy to buy out.

310
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,777
We're also aware that
you haven't been able to

311
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,405
get your hands on any of these
for nearly the entire day now.

312
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,324
Given the degree your
body's been extended,

313
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,035
controlling it
must be difficult.

314
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,084
[JUZO] Why'd you have to go and
do a dumb thing like that?

315
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,087
Take him.

319
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,389
[CUNNINGHAM]
During the war,

320
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,184
you were an Extended feared
by enemies and allies alike.

321
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:44,981
But look what happens to you
when you run out of your smokes.

322
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,943
I'm thankful every day I have
nothing in common with you.

323
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,113
[CUNNINGHAM]
Listen carefully.

324
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,449
Controlling the city's
supply of cigarettes was easy.

325
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,578
If you keep refusing our
proposal, we'll be forced to

326
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,582
destroy everything
you care about bit by bit.

At first I didn't
think it was possible,

but it's him, isn't it?

00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,065
Why's he being used as
some kind of guinea pig?

Is that really what
your boss wants?

There's nothing
strange about it at all.

00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,241
Every employee's a cog
in the company machine.

339
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,868
It makes no difference
whether or not

340
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,287
you're the son of the CEO.

341
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,414
Gears don't have free will.

342
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,500
They simply listen and
do whatever they're told.

343
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,378
Just like you did in the past.

344
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,380
[JUZO grunts]

345
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,966
I can't believe
it's that hour already.

346
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,302
You see, I made plans
to get home early tonight

347
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,554
so I could enjoy
dinner with my family.

348
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:03,100
So if you wouldn't mind giving
us your answer, Mr. Inui.

349
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,269
[JUZO groans]

350
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,813
[JUZO] Y'know, you
ended up missing something

351
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,441
when you did that
background check on me.

352
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,695
[JUZO grunting]

353
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,454
[JUZO] I don't smoke
Tanegashimas because I have to.

354
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,249
I smoke 'em because
I like the way they taste.

355
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,877
[CUNNINGHAM whimpering]

356
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,879
[JUZO]
Oh, and one more thing.

357
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,714
The kid made it clear.

358
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,842
He already told me
he wasn't a tool.

359
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,596
Which means he's not the lost
property you're looking for.

360
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,892
[JUZO] But if you wanna
keep wasting my time,

361
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:48,437
then you can
forget about dinner.

362
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,483
Unfortunately, I seem
to be losing control.

363
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,280
[JUUZO] Guess that means
I won't go easy on you.

364
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,116
[CUNNINGHAM screams]

365
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,243
[crash]

366
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,626
[JUZO panting]

367
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,212
Do it now! Why're you waiting?

368
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,631
Hurry up and shoot him!

369
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,218
[MARY] You're asking a lot from
a person who lost their arms.

370
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,555
I know a great engineer if
you ever want them replaced,

371
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,349
Mr. Beruhren Employee.

372
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,686
[JUZO] Looks like you're
out of expendable gears.

373
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,148
Why don't you take them back
to that fine company of yours?

374
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:36,318
Maybe if you fix 'em up,
they'll help you next time.

375
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,822
I hope you understand the
consequences of your actions.

376
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:40,656
[JUZO]
Huh?

377
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,951
There's no place in this
city that's safe for you now!

378
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,121
I suggest you start
watching your back closely.

379
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,289
[JUZO]
Hey, hey, hey, hold on!

380
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,418
I didn't mean to take those
back! At least leave me one!

381
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,546
[MARY]
Big surprise.

382
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,883
Looks like you managed to get
yourself into trouble, Juzo...

383
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,259
...yet again.

384
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,719
[JUZO]
Huh?

385
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,149
[JUZO]
Disgusting.

386
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,734
[MARY]
Of course they are.

387
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,237
I only copied Tanegashima's
active ingredients.

388
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,990
And I don't know anything about

389
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,618
how cigarettes are
supposed to taste.

390
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:29,872
[JUZO] So, Mary, why are you
wearing that ridiculous mask?

391
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,081
[MARY]
What do ya think, dummy?

392
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,125
I'm usin' it to
hide my identity,

393
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,085
so don't say my name!

394
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,465
[MARY] I'm not eager to
get caught up in your mess.

395
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:43,093
[JUZO] Seems to me you're
neck‐deep in it already.

396
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,262
Yeah, well, I called
your office earlier,

397
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,972
but you weren't
picking up the phone.

398
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,641
Not to mention it
looked like you were

399
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,477
going through some
serious withdrawal earlier.

400
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,104
So I came out and
look what I found.

401
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,689
[JUZO]
You called me?

402
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,733
[MARY]
Right, I almost forgot.

403
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,112
[MARY] The kid you brought in,
he finally woke up.

404
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,664
[MARY]
Say, "ahh."

405
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,499
[TETSURO] It's my responsibility
to stop Beruhren's evil deeds.

406
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,834
[ANNE]
Ende, don't let go of me!

407
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:39,752
[KYUSEI]
So you're Juzo, the Resolver.

408
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,338
[ENDE]
I know, Anne! I won't!

409
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,342
[JUZO]
<i>No Guns Life</i> Episode Three:

410
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,760
"Puppet."

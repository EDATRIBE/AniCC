1
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,394
[OLIVIER]
Yuckie!

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,897
[JUZO]
Whoa! That reeks!

3
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,399
What the hell are
you doin', Olivier?

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,237
I thought it would be obvious.

5
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,906
My Resolver and subordinates
don't listen to me.

6
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,618
And my superiors are engaged in
shady dealings behind my back.

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,245
So I'm releasing the stress

8
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,706
of being sandwiched
between all the drama.

9
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,042
Eee‐yuck!

10
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,295
[JUZO]
How's Mary and the others?

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,340
[OLIVIER]
Safe, like I promised.

12
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,551
They're in our custody.

13
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,678
[JUZO]
That helps me out a lot.

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,054
[OLIVIER]
Is that so?

15
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,013
Huh?

16
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,558
[OLIVIER] One of your
friends is very interesting.

17
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,893
The young boy without any ID.

18
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:04,022
Seems he has scars from
an illegal extension operation.

19
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,441
In a weird coincidence,

20
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,610
I heard Beruhren is
searching for an Extended

21
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,655
that recently escaped
from one of their facilities.

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,077
Remember one thing, Juzo.

23
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,080
You better adopt the right
attitude, 'cause if you don't,

24
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,999
I'll send you and
your precious client

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,543
to Wunder Bender
without a second thought.

26
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,836
This is a warning‐‐

27
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,423
don't take the promise
between us lightly ever again.

28
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,010
I'm telling you
for both our sakes.

29
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,684
[JUZO]
You're one dangerous dame.

30
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,185
No need to worry.

31
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,229
I keep my promises.

32
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,400
[JUZO] Besides,
I can't take you opening

33
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,986
any more of those
cans to burn off steam.

34
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:55,115
[OLIVIER] Heh! No one
asked, you smoking gun.

35
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,074
[JUZO]
Here we go.

36
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,870
So this is the final escapee
that needs capturing.

37
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,623
[OLIVIER]
Prisoner 0001.

38
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,875
His name's Hayden Gondry.

39
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,254
[OLIVIER]
And he's ex‐military.

40
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,392
[OLIVIER]
Fifteen years ago,

41
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,353
Gondry was assigned to the
western region of Norse Scott

42
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,565
and underwent one of the
first extension procedures.

43
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,733
However,

44
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,526
we lost most of the
records pertaining

45
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,737
to the operation
during the Great War.

46
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,697
[JUZO]
You don't say.

47
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,825
There's no way of knowing
what his role in the war was.

48
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,870
Sadly, the only data
we were able to find

49
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,748
just mentioned the
Nightmare of Norse Scott.

50
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,791
[JUZO]
I've heard stories about it.

51
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,252
[OLIVIER]
Ten years ago,

52
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,172
Gondry went berserk
for reasons unknown.

53
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,716
Murdered the
soldiers in his unit.

54
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,969
All together,
there were 16 causalities.

55
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,973
The military police, before they
were called EMS, captured him.

56
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,685
He was held at Wunder Bender
until the day he escaped.

57
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,607
[OLIVIER]
The family of the victims

58
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,651
never received answers
about what really happened.

59
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,446
Nor was he put on
trial for his crimes.

60
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,784
Since his escape,
we have reason to suspect

61
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,454
that Gondry has been responsible
for three separate homicides:

62
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,790
These unlucky corpses.

63
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,708
First was a delivery driver.

64
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,252
Second was an
unidentified vagrant.

65
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,006
Last one's a big shot with
the Reconstruction Agency.

66
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,842
There's nothing in any of their
backgrounds connecting them.

67
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,845
Even the murders and
locations seem random.

68
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,931
The only commonality
the victims share

69
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,517
is that they have
full‐body extensions.

70
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,726
On top of that,

71
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,271
their sub‐brains were removed
at the scene of the crime.

72
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,066
[JUZO] So no one would be able
to recover their history logs.

73
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,235
Right. Which means we
can't even confirm

74
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,946
an exact time of death for them.

75
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,863
[JUZO]
Then what makes you think

76
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,658
this was Gondry's
handiwork in the first place?

77
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,829
[OLIVIER] This sequence
is carved into each

78
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,789
of the dead bodies.

79
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:35,043
The code stands for
East, Ward Three, 0001.

80
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,213
It's Gondry's prison number.

81
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,090
We believe there's
a high probability

82
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,050
the delivery driver
was an accomplice

83
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,094
that aided with the escape.

84
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,472
We're looking into whether or
not Spitzbergen was involved,

85
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,558
but no leads have turned up yet.

86
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,852
[JUZO]
There's that name again.

87
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:56,273
Why would an anti‐extension
group even throw in with Gondry?

88
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,899
[OLIVIER]
The Nightmare of Norse Scott

89
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,194
was the first renegade
Extended case on record.

90
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:05,156
At the time, pro‐extensionist
groups insisted Gondry's actions

91
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,285
had nothing to do with
the augmentations to his body.

92
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,204
Meanwhile, those with
anti‐extensionist views

93
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,457
were convinced the
technology was to blame.

94
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,960
If the reason for his actions
was definitively linked

95
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,504
to the extension
procedure he went through,

96
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,091
it would've never become
as popular as it is today.

97
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,011
That's the only reason
his existence matters.

98
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,139
He's symbolic enough
for Spitzbergen to target.

99
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,434
[JUZO]
So, in the end, which was it?

100
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,144
We still don't know.

101
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,437
By the time the smoke cleared,

102
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,482
Gondry was sentenced to Wunder
Bender for the rest of his life.

103
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,736
In other words, those in power
tried burying the problem.

104
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,029
Because he was locked away,

105
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,741
no one could get
to him, not even EMS.

106
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,618
I'll shoot it to you straight.

107
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,870
Our number one
priority is to stop him

108
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,164
before he can
kill anymore, but...

109
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,584
We've also been given a once
in a lifetime opportunity!

110
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,629
After he's caught,
we can drag Gondry to court!

111
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,551
Promise, Juzo!

112
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,220
You'll bring that
monster back alive!

113
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,640
[JUZO]
I see how it is.

114
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,766
What?

115
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,936
[JUZO]
Let me ask you one thing.

116
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,439
[JUZO]
You're sure about this?

117
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,358
It's what you really want?

118
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,819
Of course it is.

119
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,323
As director of EMS,
I'm giving you an order.

120
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,910
[JUZO]
Fine then.

121
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,287
The bullet's loaded
in the chamber.

122
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,832
Leave the rest to me, Director.

123
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,542
We'll talk soon.

124
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,509
[OLIVIER'S DAD]
Listen, Olivier.

125
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,261
It's one thing to
lead other people,

126
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,055
but you should
never use that power

127
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,183
to satisfy your own motives.

128
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,687
When it becomes personal,
there is no justice.

129
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,440
My actions must always be
guided by one thing alone‐‐

130
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,526
following the law.

131
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,444
[JUZO]
You're sure about this?

132
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,488
It's what you really want?

133
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,576
I've got a ways
to go, Dad, don't I?

134
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,537
[beeping]

135
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,206
[SUBORDINATE A]
Director, you've been asked

136
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,666
to attend the hearing.

137
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,292
Orders from the top.

138
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,838
I'm on my way.

139
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,306
[JUZO] Do me a favor
and hang out here a minute.

140
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,892
[DRIVER A]
Huh? Uh, but I was told to‐‐

141
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,145
[JUZO] Look. I'll pay
you for your trouble.

142
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,105
Just sit tight, okay?

143
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,860
[JUZO] So this was
the third victim's home.

144
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,487
I don't blame him
for living here. Uh, ah!

145
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,947
‐‐[DRIVER A] Someone help me!
‐‐[JUZO] Hey! Wait!

146
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,365
[DRIVER A]
He had a gun to my face!

147
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,575
[JUZO sighs]

148
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,620
[JUZO]
Guess I'm walking back.

149
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,632
[JUZO] Victim's name
was Phillip le CarrÃ©.

150
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,844
The owner of this gilded armory.

151
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,637
An accomplished war vet,

152
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,975
which earned him a top spot
at the Reconstruction Agency.

153
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,895
To prepare for his speech,
which he was set to deliver

154
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,315
during the public unveiling
of the Mega Armed Statue,

155
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,526
he holed himself up
in his second house.

156
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,611
[JUZO]
Huh?

157
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,615
[JUZO]
His second home?

158
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,325
[JUZO] Looks like that
fancy position of his

159
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,410
reaped a lot of benefits.

160
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,253
[JUZO]
Wasn't much of a fight.

161
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,799
Victim was an Extended
with full‐body extensions.

162
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,052
Yet he was taken down
in the first round.

163
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,722
Hard to get my head around
just how easily he was defeated.

164
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,392
If only I could
uncover some motive.

165
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,519
[JUZO]
Hm?

166
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,947
[JUZO]
These guys...

167
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,573
Where have I‐‐

168
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,658
[JUZO gasps]

169
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,247
[JUZO grunts]

170
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,587
[JUZO] You shouldn't
sneak up on people like that.

171
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,008
I thought Gondry came back, but
instead it's just you, Kronen!

172
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,136
I could say the same, Juzo.

173
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,138
What are you doing here?

174
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,598
Did the director
put you up to this?

175
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,143
She has you wrapped
around her finger.

176
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,477
[JUZO]
The way I remember it,

177
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,230
you're not supposed go
digging around this case.

178
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,482
Orders from the top.

179
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,027
No one stops me
from upholding the law.

180
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,529
Take my advice‐‐

181
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,615
you're the one who really ought
to be leaving this case alone.

182
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,326
Whatever's going on,
an Over‐Extended like yourself

183
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,245
doesn't want to get
caught up in it.

184
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,290
[JUZO] You know, I'd love
to heed your suggestion,

185
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,878
but once I take on a case,
I don't stop till it's resolved.

186
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,547
[KRONEN] Filling the void
left by the war, I see.

187
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,384
Desperate to do the bidding of
others and solve their problems.

188
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,305
[JUZO] No reason to
make it sound heavy.

189
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,973
What about you?

190
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,435
Aren't you holding on to
that sense of duty yourself?

191
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,773
[JUZO grunts]

192
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,413
[JUZO groans]

193
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,335
[JUZO]
What's wrong?

194
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,295
Is that your best shot?

195
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,963
[KRONEN]
You realized it was impossible

196
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,548
to evade all the needles,

197
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,675
so you moved in a way
to ensure they landed

198
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,303
a few millimeters
from the trigger points.

199
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,722
Meaning none of them
had any effect on you.

200
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,392
Stop pretending you're
frozen in place and move.

201
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,022
[JUZO sighs]
If you insist.

202
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,902
[JUZO] Thought about
knocking you unconscious

203
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,570
after you let your guard down.

204
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,614
Decided against it last minute.

205
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,408
Didn't want to
accidentally kill you.

206
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,328
Even so, I've got to
admire how you kept up,

207
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,872
despite being extension‐free.

208
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,169
[JUZO]
How unlike you.

209
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,718
[JUZO] Already given
up trying to stop me?

210
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,138
I'm out of needles.

211
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,556
And without them,

212
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,684
I've no way of stopping
an Over‐Extended

213
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,227
like yourself right now.

214
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,895
But don't forget‐‐

215
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,274
I've always got an
eye on you law‐breakers.

216
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:58,152
And the second you dip
your hands into crime...

217
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:02,740
...I swear I'll hunt you down
even if it costs me my life.

218
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,286
[JUZO] Got a real fire in
your soul when it comes to work.

219
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,789
[JUZO]
Guess you'll do.

220
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,917
I need you to drive me
to Gondry's next target.

221
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,877
You got a car, right?

222
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,714
You know where he'll strike?

223
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,507
How?

224
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,092
[JUZO]
It just came to me

225
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,720
after looking at
the people in this photo.

226
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,680
They served together in the war.

227
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,808
That's the connection
between the victims.

228
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,643
They were extension subjects‐‐

229
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,896
soldiers that belonged to
the first generation unit.

230
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,566
Went by the name Tindalos.

231
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,775
And out of all of 'em,

232
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,986
three have already
been bumped off.

233
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,613
Which leaves only two.

234
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,408
One is the prisoner,
Hayden Gondry.

235
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,577
As for the other one...

236
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,705
[CROWD]
Army! Army! Army...

237
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:54,959
[JUZO] ...he was the first man
to become a full‐body Extended.

238
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,422
[JUZO]
A certain Mega Armed.

239
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,721
[JUZO]
Full name, Tokisada Mega Armed.

240
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,308
Offered himself up for the sake
of advancing extension tech.

241
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,935
A real war hero.

242
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,396
These days, he's living
high off the hog,

243
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,358
making a living selling
food for the Extended.

244
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,948
[JUZO] Never has to worry about
running out of smokes, I bet.

245
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,116
Lucky son of a gun.

246
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:31,287
[KRONEN] It's a car, not
a piece of furniture. Get off.

247
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,373
[JUZO]
Took you long enough.

248
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,541
It turns out our guy's not home.

249
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,044
Made a trip over to
End of War Commemoration Park

250
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:42,173
to examine the Armed Statue
before its grand unveiling.

251
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,967
[JUZO] Guess our hero's
got a busy schedule.

252
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,015
[JUZO] This thing looks
bigger on the outside.

253
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,142
Feel like a sardine in here.

254
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,438
[JUZO]
Damn it!

255
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,524
Not an ashtray either.

256
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,985
Now listen, this car is vintage,
from before the Great War,

257
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,654
and there's no other
model on the road

258
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,697
in as pristine a condition.

259
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,075
Extended are so ready
to replace parts,

260
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,911
they have no appreciation
for a work of art such as this.

261
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,164
You're in a masterpiece
of engineering.

262
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,708
Go ahead and try
hurting my baby.

263
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,380
You'll get ejected faster
than a spent shell casing.

264
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,551
[JUZO groans]

265
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,387
[KRONEN] I looked into it, but
couldn't find records of Gondry

266
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,390
and any of the victims
belonging to the same unit.

267
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,183
You sure about this lead?

268
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,061
[JUZO] There's only a
small percentage of people

269
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,522
who knew about the
existence of Tindalos.

270
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,232
That's because the
records all deal with

271
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,444
leaders involved
in extension tech.

272
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,695
I'm sure either the government

273
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,614
or Beruhren covered
up the information.

274
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,909
[KRONEN]
Then how can you even be sure?

275
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,994
[JUZO]
'Cause I'm a newer model

276
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,122
based on the data collected
in battle from Tindalos.

277
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,999
And when it comes to my seniors,

278
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,502
I won't forget their
faces anytime soon.

279
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,297
So the short version
is Gondry's going around

280
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,424
killing his few
remaining war buddies.

281
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,425
[JUZO]
Basically.

282
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,886
But as for motive,
I've got nothing.

283
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,972
Huh. Renegade Extended
go berserk, that's why.

284
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,183
It's not like
they need a reason.

285
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,851
The guy's living in the past.

286
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:21,105
Time hasn't moved forward since
the Nightmare of Norse Scott.

287
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,107
[JUZO]
Wonder if that's the case.

288
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,905
[JUZO]
Ugh!

289
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,114
[JUZO groaning]

290
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,449
[KRONEN]
Inui.

291
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,534
Did you just scratch my car?

292
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,204
[JUZO] Don't blame the
victim! You were driving!

293
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:41,250
[CROWD]
Army! Army! Army! Army...

294
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,922
[CROWD cheering]

295
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,632
I wonder when Army's showing up!

296
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,884
[ANTI‐EXTENDED A] Extension
technology's the devil's work!

297
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,470
More regulations now!

298
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,139
[JUZO] Well, he's certainly
brought people together.

299
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,267
Now, if we only knew
what Gondry's abilities were.

300
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,731
[JUZO] This situation could
get real ugly, real fast.

301
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,941
[BOY B]
Hurry up!

302
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,776
I heard someone say he's here!

303
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,902
[gasps]

304
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,074
[JUZO]
Gotta watch your back, kiddo.

305
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,079
[JUZO]
Uhh...

306
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,288
I swear I won't look at you!

307
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,542
But just don't turn on
the waterworks, please!

308
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,086
[GIRL A]
It's okay. I won't cry.

309
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,382
Are you proud of me?

310
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,550
[JUZO]
Folks twice your size

311
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,052
go running when
they see my face.

312
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,929
You're pretty impressive, kid.

313
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,931
[GIRL A]
Know why I'm not scared?

314
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,559
Your face seems
familiar to me somehow.

315
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,560
[JUZO]
It does?

[CROWD cheering]

317
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,484
Huh. Sounds like the
guest of honor has arrived.

318
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,404
Everyone, I need you
to step back now!

319
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,406
Please stand back!

Army!

00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,131
Could you show us
your famous move?

00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,257
Don't do it, sir!

324
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,883
If we excite the crowd any more,

325
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,803
we won't be able to
keep the area secure‐‐

[TOKISADA]
I mustn't disappoint my public!

327
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,225
[STAFFER A]
Master Tokisada, please wait!

328
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,226

Ahh!

329
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,395

Funke...

330
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,063
...Faust!

331
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,612
[TOKISADA]
Achieving this level of power

332
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,990
is no longer an
unattainable dream.

333
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,493
Promise me, boy,
that you'll aim high.

334
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,537
[laughs] I will!

[CROWD cheering]

336
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,378
Guy's a blank.
All noise, zero impact.

337
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,088
To be honest,
I can almost understand

338
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,341
why Gondry would
want to take him out.

339
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,593
[JUZO] After getting
a good look at that attack,

340
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,678
there's not a doubt in my mind.

341
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,267
[JUZO] He's definitely
one of my seniors.

342
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,478
[GIRL A]
Excuse me, sir.

00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,021
[TOKISADA]
Hm?

344
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,648
Here. For you.

345
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,984
Sorry, but gifts have
to be sent to‐‐ Uh.

346
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,486
[TOKISADA]
It's the duty of a hero

347
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,323
to embrace the
admiration of the young.

348
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,326
Little girl, these flowers
are as beautiful as you,

349
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,827
and I accept them.

350
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:26,874
[CROWD cheering]

351
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,881
[WOMAN A]
Army! Army! Army! Army! Army!

352
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,676
[TOKISADA]
Hm?

353
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,306
[TOKISADA]
What is this?

354
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,728
[JUZO] I'd advise you to
take this chance to get away.

355
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,356
‐‐[TOKISADA] You're a...
‐‐[STAFFER A] Master Tokisada!

356
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,941
This way, quick!

357
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,736
[JUZO]
So you're Gondry, huh?

358
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,615
[JUZO] If you wanna
attack somebody so badly,

359
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:00,825
I'll volunteer.

360
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,702
Let's go, punk.

361
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,998
[MAN A]
Don't get in my way!

362
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,208
[JUZO]
Not to worry.

363
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,671
I'll hold back only because I
was asked to capture you alive!

364
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,464
Ugh!

365
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,174
[KRONEN]
Step aside, Inui.

366
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,343
EMS will take care of him.

367
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,930
[KRONEN] You just sit back
and see how it's done!

368
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,640
[JUZO]
With my back turned!

369
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,475
Man, that's low.

370
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,567
Huh?

371
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,527
[KRONEN groaning]

372
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,822
[JUZO] Just what
the hell's going on here?

373
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,700
Whoever that is,
it's not Gondry.

374
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,285
Not by a mile.

375
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,751
‐‐[STAFFER A] This way.
‐‐[TOKISADA] That's enough.

376
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,712
I'm sure we've
reached a safe distance.

377
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,505
Such foolish behavior.

378
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,090
Doesn't he realize
I've spent my life

379
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,510
helping the Extended
be recognized as citizens?

380
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,721
[TOKISADA]
No.

381
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,389
I should be more compassionate.

382
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,225
There's no telling what
sort of life he's lived.

383
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,853
I'm ashamed I wasn't
more sympathetic

384
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,522
and that I was caught off guard.

385
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,859
What's truly miraculous
is this little girl.

386
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,612
So young, yet she
managed to stay calm

387
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,655
throughout the entire ordeal.

388
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:26,202
For your bravery, you have the
respect of Tokisada Mega Armed.

389
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,369
Beg your pardon,

390
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,372
but the culprit may have
accomplices working for him.

391
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,958
We shouldn't stop until
we make it out of the park,

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,793
otherwise‐‐

393

‐‐[squelching]
‐‐[groaning]

394
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,504
‐‐[TOKISADA] What?
‐‐[STAFFER A] Otherwise‐‐

395
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,338
‐‐[squelching]
‐‐[STAFFER B groans]

396
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,172
[STAFFER A]
Otherwise‐‐

397
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,633
‐‐[STAFFER C groans]
‐‐[TOKISADA] It can't be.

398
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,471
[TOKISADA]
Impossible!

399
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,807
[GIRL A]
I didn't cry.

400
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,975
[GIRL A, GONDRY]
Would you like to know why?

401
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,361
[GONDRY] Because your
face was so familiar.

402
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,696
Are you still proud of me?

403
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,289
[JUZO]
It looks like you're his...

404
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,499
[TOKISADA] Have no fear,
you with a gun for a head.

405
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,209
[JUZO] I'll wake up from
the dream the past left behind.

406
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,922
[GONDRY] Now then,
hero, how about you die?

407
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,592

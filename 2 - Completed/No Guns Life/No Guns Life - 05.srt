00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,304
[TV CASTER A] In preparation
for the grand opening of

2
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,265
the End of War Commemoration
Park in six months,

3
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,852
there will be a public unveiling
of the Mega Armed Statue‐‐

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,813
what many consider to be
a symbol of the new plaza.

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,982
[JUZO]
The name's Juzo Inui.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,817
I make a living
resolving problems

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,112
caused by Extended in this city.

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,698
Ever since the incident
in the Kyusei Pit,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,368
the Beruhren Corporation's
been laying low.

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,995
However, Tanegashimas
still aren't available

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,705
for sale anywhere.

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,753
[JUZO] Well, these
fakes aren't half bad,

13
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,214
especially in the
comfort of my office.

14
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,258
[TETSURO]
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Easy!

15
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,094
That hurts, Mary!

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,930
The fact it stings means there's
still feeling left in your legs,

17
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,265
so you should be thankful.

18
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,099
Here we go.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,892
[screams]

20
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,394
[MARY]
Hey. I need you to stay still...

21
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,021
[JUZO] If only there
was less screaming.

22
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,076
[MARY] I had to
decrease the output a bit,

23
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,703
but this ought to lighten
the load on your sub‐brain.

24
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,330
On the subject of Harmony,

25
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,374
there're a few tests
I wanna run later,

26
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,793
but maybe we should
save them for another day.

27
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,586
I second that.

28
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,088
[TV CASTER A]
Our next story.

29
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,382
Regarding the mysterious
flying object

30
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,677
that was reportedly seen
shooting out of the Kyusei Pit,

31
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,262
the Security Bureau now
suspects the Kyusei Group

32
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,390
was responsible and
most likely testing out

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,809
some illegal weaponry.
We have some‐‐

34
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,728
That was a flashy display
you pulled back there.

35
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,815
Could be bad news if
EMS finds out the truth.

36
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,358
[JUZO]
Could be.

37
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,693
[TETSURO]
EMS?

38
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,071
Yeah. They're a part of
the Reconstruction Agency.

39
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,155
It's a group that plans

40
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,032
countermeasures
against Extendeds.

41
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,450
[TETSURO]
I already know that,

42
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,743
but I thought
the Security Bureau

43
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,329
was looking for
the culprit. Not EMS.

44
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,456
Anyone with weapon
extensions like Juzo

45
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,583
is considered to
be Over‐Extended.

46
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,421
Or to put it another way,
their very existence is illegal.

47
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,423
EMS gives them
conditional immunity

48
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,341
so they can experience
normal lives,

49
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,844
However, it does
come with some rules.

50
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,387
That immunity can be revoked

51
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,139
if they decide to do
something criminal.

52
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,559
They're back to being
considered an illegal Extend.

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,770
Then EMS would hunt you down,
and after they caught you,

54
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,399
your body would be processed
and used for scrap parts!

55
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,736
[JUZO] Running your
mouth can be unhealthy, too.

56
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,737

00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,989

killing the atmosphere!

58
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,783

It's all my fault.

Thanks for the help.

[JUZO]
Where're you going?

61
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,295
Like she said, you'll
be turned into scrap parts

62
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,630
if you get involved
in this any further!

63
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,174
Not only you, Juzo‐‐

64
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,176

accountable, too!

Don't take her so seriously.

67
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,349
For starters,
where do you plan to go?

68
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,560
Beruhren's got
their sights on you.

69
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,896
There's nowhere
in the city to hide.

70
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,105
I'll find a place!

71
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,232
[JUZO]
A client oughta act like one.

72
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,692
The only thing they
should be worried about

73
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,736
is how they're
gonna pay their fee.

74
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,121
[JUZO] Anyway, just
shut up and wait for now.

75
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,915
[gasps]

76
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,667
Seriously. You don't
need to worry about me

77
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,503
or the other people
who live here.

78
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,129
By now, the tenants are used to

79
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,215
the problems Juzo
causes everyone.

80
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,091
‐‐[JUZO] Huh?
‐‐Right?

81
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,176
[JUZO grunts]

82
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,636
That reminds me.

83
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,054
Chris wanted me to tell you

84
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,181
she's got a pot waiting
for you to pick up.

85
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,015
[JUZO]
Of what?

86
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,684
Turns out Mr. Huang was quite
pleased with you stopping

87
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,770
Ende's rampage through
their territory.

88
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,189
So in lieu of cash,
he sent us some crab.

89
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,024
[JUZO]
We're gonna eat it here?

90
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,985
Damn it, my office
isn't a cafeteria.

91
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,571
Chris fixed your window
and put it on your tab.

92
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,075
The least you can do
is try acting polite.

93
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,159
[TETSURO]
All right, then.

94
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,704
At least let me go and
bring the landlady over.

95
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,207
And apologize for
breaking the window.

96
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,875
[MARY] I wouldn't
recommend going alone.

97
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,210
[TETSURO]
Don't worry.

98
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,087
Well, you've never met her.

00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,718
[CHRISTINA] There's no need
to be afraid, cutie pie.

101
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,136
Just give in to it.

102
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,680
[TETSURO]
Help me, Juzo!

103
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,808
I can't pay you
if I'm not alive!

104
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,939
[CHRISTINA] A little sweetie‐
pants just barges in my room,

105
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,274
looking for me.

106
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,401
How am I supposed to hold back?

107
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,152
If I had known you
were Juzo's client,

108
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,488
I would've exercised restraint.

109
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,115
Can you forgive me?

110
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,033
[TETSURO]
Not a problem.

111
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,036
You're lucky she didn't
take it any further than that.

112
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,706
Looks like it's just
about ready to serve.

113
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,295
[CHRISTINA] Mm, barely fits and
needed to be crammed inside.

114
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,504
[MARY]
Now that I think about it,

115
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,673
we should've invited
Scarlet and her old man.

116
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,675
[CHRISTINA] Those workaholics
couldn't leave the shop,

117
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,011
so I shared some
ingredients with them.

118
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,600
[TETSURO gags]

119
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,934
Are you all right?

120
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,352
[TETSURO]
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,396
Seeing the crab
reminded me of something.

122
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,983
Tetsuro, poor baby,
you're not a fan of crustaceans?

123
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,318
How about this?

124
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,320
Try some <i>mochi‐kinchaku</i>.

125
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,071
I have enough for everyone.

126
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,489
Ahh!

127
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,533
[CHRISTINA] One lucky
person gets an egg inside.

128
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,577

Ooh!

[JUZO]
Christina, I'm not‐‐

130
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,496
Come now.

131
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,957
There's no reason
to be antisocial.

132
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,919
[MARY gasps]
My mochi!

133
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,753
Don't let it fall!

134
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,587
[TETSURO]
Juzo?

135
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,922
[JUZO]
Sorry,

136
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,341
but I'm not the type that
plays well with others.

137
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,719
Saved by the five second rule!

138
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,471
[TETSURO]
What was that all about?

139
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,513
[CHRISTINA sighs]

140
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,224
Juzo isn't used to this
much social interaction,

141
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,809
so it can be hard on him.

142
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,896
The two of you are
similar in a lot of ways.

143
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,441
Me and Juzo? You think so?

144
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,318
I agree.

145
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,195
He's worried his
existence will end up

146
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,989
hurting the people around him.

147
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,033
That's the reason he's
always putting distance

148
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,452
between himself and others.

149
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,245

Hey! The egg!

[JUZO]
Hm?

152
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,635
[SCARLET]
Please let go of me.

153
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,261
I need to be somewhere.

154
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,471
[SECURITY A]
What's the rush?

155
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,431
After all, we're
giving up vacation hours

156
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,599
to make the rounds.

157
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,519
So the least you could do is
be a little more polite to us!

158
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,687
Yeah, c'mon, girl!

159
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,855
[JUZO]
Damn it.

160
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,148
The way I understood it,

161
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,444
government dogs and dogs in heat
were two different animals.

162
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,490

Which ones are you again?

‐‐Hey!
‐‐That guy's an Over‐Extended!

[JUZO]
C'mon, now.

165
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,915
You're makin' me seem
like a loose cannon.

166
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,584
I may not look it,
but I'm just an average‐joe

167
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,587
with a license from the
Reconstruction Agency.

168
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,926
It checks out.

169
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,678
A license and everything.

170
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,054
[SECURITY A]
Let's scram. He killed the mood.

171
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,557
[SECURITY B]
Damn. That's a helluva face.

172
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,435
[JUZO] Go back to the office
and chew on some donuts.

173
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,603
[JUZO]
Huh?

174
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,064
Oh, Juzo. I was so scared!

175
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,109
[JUZO stammering]
Scarlet.

176
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,697
I just... wanted...
to say thank you.

177
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,865
[JUZO]
And, uh,

178
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,868
I just happened to have some
business with your father.

179
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,619
Y‐You've got some bad luck,

180
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,121
getting approached
by those goons

181
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,165
right in front of your place.

182
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,709
Aw, my luck isn't all that bad.

183
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,919
After all, you showed up.

184
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,337
[bell rings]

185
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,256
[JUZO]
You in, old man?

186
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,509
[JUZO]
Old man?

187
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,096
[SCARLET gasps]

188
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,057
[JUZO] What happened?
Did he choke on his mochi?

189
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,434
Wake up, Dad!

190
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:23,229
[ANDY screams]
Tell me there's more crab!

191
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,320
Ahh. Welcome back, Zippo.

192
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,197
It certainly has been a while.

193
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,698
[JUZO]
Had me worried.

194
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,034
And would you call
me Juzo already?

195
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,747
Look at that.

196
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,209
You let someone pull
your trigger after all.

197
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,670
So you finally found
a person you could trust.

198
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,756
[JUZO]
No, nothing like that.

199
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,718
[JUZO]
But it had to be done.

200
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,221
[ANDY chuckles]

201
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,848
[ANDY] I've had this shop
since the end of the Great War,

202
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,141
five years now,

203
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,686
and you're still the only one
who ever asks me to do this.

204
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,771
[JUZO]
That a fact?

205
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,108
A craftsman of your
caliber? What a waste.

206
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:08,983
[chuckles]

207
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,612
Go on joking, but you've never
seen me with a pair of scissors.

208
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,947
[JUZO]
I'm being serious.

209
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,657
You should have more customers.

210
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,910
If you closed shop,
I don't know what I'd do.

211
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:19,744
[SCARLET]
Never!

212
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,578
[JUZO, ANDY]
Huh?

213
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,039
I'd never let our
doors shut permanently!

214
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,625
F‐F‐For your sake, Juzo!

215
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,878
Uhh, yeah.
I kinda depend on you.

216
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,214
[chuckles] All right.

217
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,134
Just gonna lower you so I can
take care of that muzzle.

218
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,846
Hey, scoot down
a little bit more.

219
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,097
You're no small fry.

220
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,474
Would you care for
a warm towel, sir?

221
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:51,025
[footsteps]

222
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,488
[OLIVIER] I know you're
being hunted by Beruhren.

223
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,575
[OLIVIER] And if this
barrel of yours blows,

224
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,995
the Reconstruction Agency
will sniff around for you.

225
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,248
And when they do, you'll use
us to throw them off the trail,

226
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,083
since we don't get along.

227
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,961
You've got it all worked out.

228
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,963
Damn. You're so clever.

229
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,965
[SCARLET whimpers]

230
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,719
[JUZO] I figured you'd
show up eventually, Olivier.

231
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,640
Time you made good
on your promise to me.

232
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,392
I hope you're ready.

233
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,187
[OLIVIER]
You have been charged

234
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,441
with the suspected use of
a restricted weapon extension.

235
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,194
Thus, your license
has been revoked.

236
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,989
We're placing you
under arrest, Juzo.

237
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:39,824
[MARY]
Aww...

238
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,075
[TETSURO]
Yeah, well, that's what you get

239
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,285
for trying to eat
all the porridge

240
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,163
right after downing my
helping of <i>kinchaku</i>.

241
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,373
[MARY] You're the one who
said you couldn't eat crab.

242
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,791
I did you a favor.

243
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,126
[TETSURO]
Seriously.

244
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,544
We should've just
shared the hot pot

245
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,880
with everyone else
from the beginning.

246
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,717
Could you try and stop being
logical for, like, two seconds?

247
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,720
Just so you know, that's
not really popular with girls.

248
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,514
[TETSURO] Hurry up
and open the door already.

249
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,600
The porridge is
starting to get cold.

250
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,728
[MARY]
Yeah, yeah. You are like Juzo‐‐

251
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,396
too hard on people.

252
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,316
Uh.

253
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,525
[TETSURO]
Hm?

254
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,573
[TETSURO]
Guess we didn't bring enough.

255
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,700
These guys are EMS‐‐

256
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,621
Look here. It seems
we have guests.

257
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,997
[bell rings]

258
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,708
Unfortunately, we're currently
in the middle of something.

259
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,961
If you could come back later.

260
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,379
[MARY]
Your body would be processed

261
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,006
and used for scrap parts!

262
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,092
[TETSURO]
Juzo!

263
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,594
[JUZO]
No need to rush things, Olivier.

264
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,764
Besides, the old man
isn't done with me yet.

265
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,974
Come now.

266
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,060
I don't think I need to
explain the situation to you.

267
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,061
If they interfere,

268
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,939
they'll be arrested
for obstructing officers.

269
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,650
[EMS OFFICER A]
Hey, stand up!

270
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,277
[JUZO]
That's right, old man.

271
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,822
The anti‐rusting lubricant you
used last time was pretty good.

272
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,156
Let's go with that again.

273
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:02,991
Oh, sure.

274
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,450
[EMS OFFICER A]
He's not moving an inch!

275
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,036
What the hell's going on?

276
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,999
I'll give you three minutes.
I won't wait any longer.

277
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,792
By the way, what's
an old gun like you

278
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,128
doin' in a place like this?

279
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,256
[JUZO] I may not look it,
but I like to stay clean.

280
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,968
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Let's finish up.

281
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,554
This may be the last
time I get the chance,

282
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,308
so I want to make sure
to be extra thorough...

283
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,060
...is probably what
a braver man would say.

284
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,479
But I pissed myself
a little just now,

285
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,440
so I should let
Scarlet take over.

286
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,399
Old man!

287
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,483
You're joking, right?

288
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,651
It'd be my honor,

289
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,154
and I'll do my best to give
you high‐quality service!

290
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,447
Uhh...

291
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,294
Why'd we have to be arrested?

292
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,296
Could you stop leering
at us, you perverts?

293
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,590
Or maybe I oughta take
your bodies apart!

294
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,507
[CHRISTINA]
Speaking of which,

295
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,218
you gentlemen do
you have nice bodies.

296
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,056
[TETSURO] If they're actually
Extended under those uniforms,

297
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,391
I may be able to
take control of them.

298
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,978
[TETSURO]
This time, I can save Juzo.

299
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,939
[MARY] Don't think about
trying anything stupid.

300
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,107
[TETSURO]
Mary?

301
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,401
You would be putting
all of us at risk.

302
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,570
Can you imagine what would
happen if they ended up

303
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,073
finding out you had
Harmony installed?

304
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:29,327
For now, all that we can do is
be patient and trust in Juzo.

305
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,581
[JUZO]
That Scarlet's somethin' else.

306
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,708
Not only did she
not clean my muzzle,

307
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,627
she left oil all over me.

308
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,255
The spin of my cylinder's
off and it's killing me.

309
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,508
[OLIVIER]
Only you, Juzo.

310
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,428
No one could ask me, the head
of EMS, to do such a thing.

311
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,557
I can't believe you convinced me
to shelter ordinary civilians.

312
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,311
[JUZO] You didn't expect me to
just leave 'em behind, did you?

313
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,439
Fine. You owe me another favor.

314
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,442
Maybe I should cash it in
right here in this vehicle.

315
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,276
[JUZO]
Uhh...

316
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,571
I would love to see
you try and refuse me.

317
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,117
And on the subject of oil,
I think it suits you.

318
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,285
[JUZO]
Uh, thank you.

319
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,788
Thank you? You oughta
be kissing my feet

320
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,165
for not deciding to
slap a corset on you.

321
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,750
It would've been
more convincing,

322
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,127
since it can't be made public

323
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,963
EMS cooperates
with Over‐Extendeds.

324
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,132
Especially when there's
suspicion our higher‐ups

325
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,759
have close relations
with the Beruhren Corp.

326
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:30,972
[JUZO] Working as a
bureaucrat sure sounds tough.

327
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,348
You're planning
on making my life

328
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,725
way more difficult
again, aren't you?

329
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,562
Just send me to prison already.

330
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,898
Juzo, every time I cover
up a problem you cause,

331
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,693
you make it up to me by
following one of my orders.

332
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,445
Wasn't that our arrangement?

333
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,487
[JUZO]
Damn it.

334
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,114
Or if you would rather,

335
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,075
we can send you off
to Wunder Bender.

336
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,829
[JUZO] A correctional facility
used exclusively for Extended.

337
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,458
Also known as the
storeroom for lethal weapons.

338
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,418
Heavy.

339
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,464
Well, can't let myself get
locked in the gun safe just yet.

340
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,801
So... what's the story?

341
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,388
[OLIVIER]
Early this morning,

342
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,684
an EMS prison transport leaving
Wunder Bender was ambushed

343
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,437
and all of the guards
were executed.

344
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,732
Furthermore,
the seven prisoners

345
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,858
that were being transferred

346
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,069
to the Beruhren research
facility managed to escape.

347
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,739
[JUZO]
Beruhren's takin' prisoners?

348
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,033
I thought you
weren't on good terms.

349
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,994
[OLIVIER] That's exactly
why this is such a headache.

350
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,163
The restraints used
to capture Extendeds

351
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,249
and restrict their sub‐brain
are referred to as corsets,

352
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,793
and Beruhren Corp holds
the exclusive rights

353
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,837
to manufacture them.

354
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,714
What a terrible joke.

355
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,716
In order to receive
their cooperation,

356
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,512
we have to send them Extended
prisoners on a regular basis.

357
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,722
Offerings to the altar.

358
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,559
[JUZO] The Reconstruction
Agency has a lot of authority,

359
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,354
but it depends on
borrowed firepower.

360
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,898
[OLIVIER] While it isn't
all that difficult to imagine

361
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,109
what Beruhren is using
the prisoners for,

362
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:11,239
currently, I lack the power to
change the situation on my own.

363
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,200
Which really pisses me off.

364
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,786
[JUZO] In other words, you need
someone to chase and hunt down

365
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,748
these convicts since you
can't do it out in the open.

366
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,375
You're welcome to refuse.

367
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,461
Then I'll have the pleasure of
doing whatever I want with you.

368
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,340
[JUZO] I swear.
You're cold as steel, Olivier.

369
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,467
Sounds like we have a deal.

370
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,469
I'm a little disappointed.

371
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,765
Why are we stopping?

372
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,268
It looks like an
accident. Apologies.

373
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,437
[OLIVIER] This always happens
when we're short on time!

374
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,106
[JUZO]
So...

375
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,234
...about the information
on the escaped prisoners.

376
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,028
[OLIVIER] Fortunately,
five out of the seven involved

377
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,364
have already been
recaptured by my unit.

378
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,616
And we've located
one of the other two.

379
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,537
[JUZO] Good. Then I don't
see what use I'd be.

380
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,914
The thing is, this
remaining prisoner‐‐

381
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,749
[crash]

382
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,875
[JUZO]
Mary!

383
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:20,725
[HUG BEAR] EMS bastards!
They don't know when to quit.

384
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,688
[EMS OFFICER C]
This guy's one of the escapees!

385
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,189
Uh, freeze!

386
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,609
Tell me, just how many
of those toy soldiers

387
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,152
do you have crammed
into that truck?

388
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,695
[EMS OFFICER D]
Stop shooting!

389
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,489
[EMS OFFICER D]
The corset's hit!

390
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,744
[HUG BEAR laughing]

391
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,497
Well, that was helpful!

392
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,750
[HUG BEAR grunting]

393
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,460
[BOTH yell]

394
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,296
Get over here!

395
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,758
Allow me to show you
how appreciative I am

396
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,426
for setting me free!

397
00:18:55,468 --> 00:19:00,473
[EMS OFFICERS screaming]

398
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,439
[EMS OFFICERS groaning]

399
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,316
[HUG BEAR]
Don't know my own strength.

400
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,151
Did I overdo it?

401
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,613
Dad, hang on.

402
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,948
Guys, I'll get you out.

403
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,659
Just hold on.

404
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,995
[HUG BEAR]
I knew there had to be more.

405
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,665
You all look like
you could use a hug.

406
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,041
[gasps]

407
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,585
[OLIVIER]
This is a nightmare!

408
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,296
Where the hell is Kronen
when I actually need him?

409

[OLIVIER gasps]

410
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,300
[JUZO groans]

411
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,678
Juzo, those cuffs were
made especially heavy duty

412
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,596
to restrain Extendeds.

413
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,099
[JUZO grunts]

414
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,974

[JUZO]
Scarlet!

416
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,144
[OLIVIER] We can't have you
moving around in public!

417
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,396
[JUZO gasps]

418
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:53,067
[HUG BEAR grunts]
What's wrong with my body?

419
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:59,532
[KRONEN]
Prisoner Number 0137.

420
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,283
Goes by the name Hug Bear.

421
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,453
You're in violation of
line four and line nine

422
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,164
of article three
under Extend Law.

423
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,208
[HUG BEAR]
Bastard! What did you do?

424
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,419
I'm placing you under arrest.

425
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,548
I've pierced various
trigger points along your back

426
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,051
with my needles, cutting off
your power transmission.

427
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,761
I'm afraid your extensions won't

428
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,472
be operating properly
for quite a while.

429
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,730
[KRONEN]
Go back to your cell

430
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,315
and reflect on what
breaking the law gets you.

431
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,443
[EMS OFFICER C]
Section Chief.

432
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,237
I'm sorry I failed you.

433
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,905
Useless garbage.

434
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,659
Have the officers that aren't
scrap put a new corset on Bear.

435
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,869
[OLIVIER]
Kronen!

436
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,289
What's the meaning of this?

437
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,792
Our superiors gave
us explicit orders

438
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,794
to capture them discreetly!

439
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,547
It's of no concern to
me how our superiors will

440
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,550
have to explain themselves
to the Beruhren Corp.

441
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,262
I only follow the law and
fulfill my assigned duties,

442
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,139
Director.

443
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,558
‐‐[JUZO] You all right?
‐‐[SCARLET] Y‐Yes!

444
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,603
Everyone's in one piece.
They're just unconscious.

445
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:14,064
I can't believe you considered
relying on him for assistance.

446
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,441
[OLIVIER gasps]

447
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,109
[KRONEN]
Juzo Inui.

448
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,738
Just another renegade that
goes around breaking Extend Law.

449
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,491
In case you didn't know,
he's been granted immunity!

450
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,619
In case you forgot,
this is our duty.

451
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,622
We'll take care of the
last prisoner ourselves.

452
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,834
Accepting help from his kind
would degrade our profession.

453
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,461
[OLIVIER]
Are you sure?

454
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:42,468
His kind's not easily defeated
and he's not our enemy, Kronen.

455
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,722
[OLIVIER]
You should be more concerned

456
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,599
with the final escapee.

457
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,685
Prisoner Number 0001.

458
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,813
Name, Hayden Gondry.

459
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,941
The first officially
recorded renegade Extended.

460
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,485
If we're going to capture him,

461
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,196
we'll need all
the help we can get.

462
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,748
[OLIVIER] Don't take a promise
between us lightly ever again.

463
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,167
[KRONEN] I've always got an eye
on you law‐breaking Extends.

00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,431
[JUZO]
Huh...

2
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,239
[PEPPER] Sure took your time.
I was losing my patience.

3
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:35,744
[JUZO] Sorry, but I'm
closed for the night.

4
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:39,081
Have a heart or did
they take that as well?

5
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:43,502
What about my request?
Aren't you going to grant it?

6
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,296
Or am I going to
have to order you to?

7
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,883
[giggles]

8
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,058
[JUZO]
Punk.

9
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,624
[JUZO]
Move your foot.

10
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,209
[SEVEN]
How come?

11
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,587
[JUZO]
That's just great.

12
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,548
You destroyed a
perfectly good smoke.

13
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,843
[SEVEN] Pepper's the only
one who can give me orders.

14
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,929
[JUZO]
Sorry about that.

15
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,392
Guess you better hurry and
ask mommy for permission then.

16
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,476
Brat.

17
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,019
[SEVEN]
Ugh!

18
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,979
Why you!

19
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,695
[PEPPER]
That's enough, Seven.

20
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,905
This room reeks
of cigarette smoke.

21
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,657
One more won't matter.

22
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,660
[SEVEN gasps]

23
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,751
Now that I see you side by side,
the difference is noticeable.

24
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,421
You've got that
classic noir look.

25
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,508
[PEPPER sniffs]
So romantic!

26
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,676
[gasps]

27
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,969
[SEVEN]
I think you just get caught up

28
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,429
in romanticism, Pepper.

29
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,847
[PEPPER]
Huh?

30
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,140
[PEPPER grunts]

31
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,435
[SEVEN]
When it comes to his kind,

32
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,981
they're relics...
and belong in the past.

33
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:55,569
[JUZO] Huh... Looks like we
have a different set of values.

34
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,991
[JUZO] You two, you're
minions of Beruhren.

35
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:05,162
[PEPPER] Really?
And what makes you think that?

36
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:10,292
I don't like the word minion,
but... you're not wrong.

37
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,045
[JUZO gasps]
Know what's funny?

38
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,423
You need a license
from the Reconstruction Agency

39
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,341
just to walk around.

40
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,802
But that's only
half the problem.

41
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:25,599
I couldn't help but notice that
right arm of yours is a Hands.

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,517
A device exclusively
used to release

43
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,729
the control program
on a Gun Slave Unit.

44
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,776
[JUZO] I'm surprised you can
still find 'em lying around.

45
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,488
Thing is, the Reconstruction
Agency would never allow

46
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,158
a Hands and a Gun Slave
Unit to work in tandem.

47
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,371
[JUZO] Unless... you're
employed by the right people

48
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,791
and have Beruhren's blessing.

49
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,337
You said your name
was Juzo Inui, correct?

50
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,177
Your room's looking
pretty barren,

51
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,846
but I guess that's
how you like it.

52
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,351
No anchors holding
you down to this place.

53
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,478
Free to leave whenever.

54
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,397
[PEPPER]
What've we here?

55
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,441
I do love books.

56
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,821
Printed words become an object.
Objects are things.

57
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,866
You can even pick them up
and have complete ownership.

58
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,285
[PEPPER]
Huh...

59
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,539
[PEPPER]
Didn't write your name inside?

60
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,416
Somebody could
easily steal this.

61
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,674
Won't be me though.

62
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,093
I decided to pay a visit
to your office today

63
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,137
for more personal reasons.

64
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,515
So, who is it?

65
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,522
[PEPPER] You're a tool,
and all tools have owners.

66
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,276
[JUZO]
I'm not following along.

67
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,281
[PEPPER] Unfortunately,
I've fallen in love with you.

68
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,032
[JUZO]
Uhh...

69
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,161
Was I not clear?

70
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,123
I wanna take you
and your owner down.

71
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:18,169
And afterward, I'll write
my own name inside of you.

72
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,672
That's my request, Mr. Resolver.

73
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,133
Will you grant it?

74
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,271
Knock him to the ground, Seven.

75
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,066

Engaging in battle.

78
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,956
[JUZO]
So it's gonna be like that?

79
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,375

[SEVEN groans]

82
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,431
[PEPPER]
So disappointing.

83
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,518
Do you plan on embarrassing
me in front of him, Seven?

84
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,612
[JUZO]
He's fast!

85
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,996
[SEVEN]
Sturm Faust!

86
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,768
So it is true. You really
don't have a shooter, then.

87
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,437
You're gonna die if
you don't get serious.

88
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,859
[JUZO]
I'm losing my patience.

89
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,570
That's the second
smoke he's destroyed.

90
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,784
[JUZO] I only use my
powers for one reason:

91
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,412
To complete a job I've accepted,

92
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,913
and after consideration,

93
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,000
listening to your
worthless request,

94
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,919
I'm choosing to pass on yours.

95
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,425
You're being serious?

96
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,427
That some kind of policy?

97
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,096
Pretty damn cool, I'll admit.

98
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,765
You've got me a little wet.

I want you even more now.

anyone to admit it.

176
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,070
Beruhren spent a ton of money
covering up the truth.

177
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,364
[JUZO] Sounds like
you're well informed.

178
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,617
Then you wouldn't mind telling
me where they are right now.

179
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,910
[KRONEN]
Hmph.

180
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,205
[JUZO] Just wanna
make a civil house call

181
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,040
asking for repair fees,

182
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,251
otherwise I could be evicted.

183
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,132
As for EMS, they've
got no intention of

184
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,884
looking further
into this matter.

185
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,387
We'll assign lookouts
to the building,

186
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,098
but anything beyond
that is up to you.

187
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,519
[JUZO]
That's outta character.

188
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,938
Get cold feet, Kronen?

189
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,275
[KRONEN]
I'll remind you.

190
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,029
There's the organization
and then there's me.

191
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,198
[KRONEN]
But you already know that.

192
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,496
[KRONEN] Let me warn you
of one thing, though.

193
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,875
The son of the Beruhren
CEO that went missing...

194
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,001
Well...

195
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,463
Seems the request for his search
has been silently retracted.

196
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,798
Suspicious, right?

197
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,009
My guess is it's
related to something

198
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,053
that you've been hiding.

199
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,360
Thanks for giving me
the warning, chief.

200
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,294
[PEPPER]
Change of plans!

201
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,881
Things aren't gonna end well for
us if we lay our hands on him.

202
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,385
[KRONEN] The son of the Beruhren
CEO that went missing...

203
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,511
Well...

204
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,972
Seems the request for his search
has been silently retracted.

205
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,849
Suspicious, right?

206
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,313
[JUZO] It doesn't make sense.
What's Beruhren planning?

207
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,653
[KRONEN] Looks like a Gun Slave
Unit working alongside a Hands

208
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,114
is too much for
even you to handle.

209
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,365
Pathetic.

210
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,785
[PEPPER] You're a tool,
and all tools have owners.

211
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,994
[TETSURO]
Juzo!

212
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,705
I want to stay here and
help you with your work!

213
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,926
[JUZO] Wish I could empty these
voices out of my cylinder.

214
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,344
Damn it.

215
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,730
[SUISO] In spring,
this crap's everywhere.

216
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,733
Feels like a snowstorm.

217
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,861
It's annoying when a
piece gets in your mouth,

218
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,614
but you gotta admit,
it's beautiful.

219
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,492
Just wanted you to
see it for yourself.

220
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,916
[SUISO] You were only following
orders from the higher‐ups.

221
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,544
In no way was it your fault.

222
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,090
[SUISO] Actually,
I was the one in the wrong.

223
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,011
[SUISO] I shouldn't have
treated you like a person.

224
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,140
Gotta remember, you're strictly
a tool, and nothing more.

225
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,225
Isn't that right...

226
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,935
...partner?

227
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,152
‐‐[TETSURO] Juzo?
‐‐[gasps]

228
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,029
[TETSURO]
Something the matter?

229
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,951
If you're sick, I can call Mary.

230
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,911
I'll be right back!

231
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,579
[JUZO]
No.

232
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,584
[JUZO]
Nothing's wrong.

233
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,921
Except I can't even take
a nap around here in peace.

234
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,551
[JUZO]
Stop looking at me like that.

235
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,428
I'm not in any pain.

236
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,971
That isn't true!

237
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,683
[JUZO] How're your
wounds? They serious?

238
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,852
I'm fine, really.

239
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,438
[JUZO]
Mary sounded pretty worried.

240
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,525
They're just burns.

241
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,276
At least we think so.

242
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,029
[JUZO] Sounds like you're
not sure how you got them.

243
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,247
Mary's calling what
happened resonance.

244
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,999
If Harmony gets
pushed to its limits,

245
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,751
then I end up
taking the same damage

246
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,420
as the Extended I'm controlling.

247
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,006
[JUZO]
You used it again, huh?

248
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,970
[gasps]

249
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,533
[JUZO]
Thanks for the hand.

250
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,161
[TETSURO]
Juzo...

251
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,290
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,959
[JUZO] You've got
no reason to apologize.

253
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,964
[TETSURO] It's my fault.
Everything that's happened.

254
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,883
I'm the reason you're
all in so much danger!

255
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,761
The reason you lost your arm!

256
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,971
‐‐[JUZO] Don't start‐‐
‐‐[TETSURO] I know the ones

257
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,640
who were here last night
were from Beruhren!

258
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,767
They were targeting me again!

259
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,227
[JUZO]
You're wrong.

260
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,688
It's me they wanted.

261
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,607
Only thing is...

262
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,528
[JUZO]
...I have no idea why.

263
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,738
[TETSURO]
Don't you see?

264
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,905
This never would've happened

265
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,700
if I didn't come here
in the first place!

266
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,869
And all those kids!

267
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,664
[TETSURO]
If only I was stronger,

268
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,959
things would have
turned out differently!

269
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,462
I could have saved Colt!

270
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,760
[TETSURO]
It's my fault.

271
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,180
I have Harmony,
but what good is it?

272
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:07,146
[TETSURO] In the end... I wasn't
able to help anyone. [cries]

273
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,110
[JUZO]
I see.

274
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,877
[MARY]
Hey, Juzo!

275
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,545
You around?

276
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,923
Oh, there you are.

277
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,967
Y'know, next time you
could answer me when I call.

278
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,345
Brought up a customer
that wants to talk.

279
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,098
[JUZO]
Customer?

280
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,518
Right this way, sir.
Apologies for the mess.

281
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,399
Nice to meet you.

282
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,027
You're Mr. Juzo Inui, I presume?

283
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,737
[JUZO]
Yeah?

284
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,447
[DANNY]
This is quite sudden,

285
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,909
but I'd like you to
watch over a young lady.

286
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,829
She's being haunted
by an Extended.

287
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,376
[JUZO]
Come again?

288
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,519
[MARY]
Oh, yeah. I could get used to

289
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,313
being chauffeured around
in a convertible!

290
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,692
[JUZO] Strange. I don't
remember inviting you along.

291
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,526
Who's going to watch over‐‐

292
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,861
It's been handled.

293
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,529
[JUZO]
Hm?

294
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,364
The boy won't get
into any trouble.

295
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,409
EMS is keeping an eye
on him, and besides,

296
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,537
it's not as if Beruhren can
afford to make a careless move.

297
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,372
If all else fails, no worries.

298
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,542
The door is rigged to
release a high‐voltage current

299
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,878
if anyone tries to open it.

300
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,213
[gasps] You could've
let me know!

301
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,716
How long ago did you
install that thing?

302
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,178
I wasn't going to stay behind
even if you asked me nicely.

303
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,764
It's my fault we couldn't
salvage your left arm.

304
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,975
So I'm coming as your
personal engineer, got it?

305
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,185
[JUZO]
Uhh...

306
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,352
[MARY]
Not to mention,

307
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,731
I'm dying to get a close‐up
look at this Extended ghost!

308
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,357
I hope they died a long time ago

309
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,944
and they're an older model I've
never seen before! [giggles]

310
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,155
[JUZO]
There's the real reason.

311
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,083
I welcome you, Mr. Inui...

312
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,628
...to the McMahon mansion.

313
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,430
[MARY]
Oh, ho, ho. I could live here.

314
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,390
[doors closing]

315
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,018
[DANNY] If you wouldn't
mind following me.

316
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,664
[ROSA]
Even for the sake of survival...

317
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,875
[MARY] You're talking
about the Extended ghost?

318
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,043
[JUZO]
I'm not a priest.

319
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,169
[ROSA]
No! Let me go!

320
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,463
[DANNY] You mean your
father didn't tell you?

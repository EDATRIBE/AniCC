1
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,226
It's a pretty simple
external extension,

2
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,894
so the area around
the attachment

3
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,562
may be swollen a little while.

4
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,940
You'll get used to it.

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,442
Don't try to rush things.

6
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,320
Unfortunately, I wasn't able
to repair your vocal cords

7
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,948
since Harmony is
interfering with them.

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,908
But we'll figure
something out eventually.

00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,162
[TETSURO grunting]

10
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,751
[RINKO]
Keep running!

11
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,921
[RINKO yells]

12
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,759
Say, "ahh."

13
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,761
[gasps]

14
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,180
Why are you looking
at me so intensely?

15
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,265
I see how it is.

16
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,392
You love being fed by
such a beautiful girl.

17
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,851
Ugh!

18
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,062
[JUZO]
Stop messing with him.

19
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,648
[MARY]
I wasn't hurting anyone!

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,858
You on the other hand...

21
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,418
[JUZO] Eat. Then you and
I are gonna have a talk...

22
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,003
...using this.

23
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,050
[thudding]

24
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,095
[HUANG] Juzo Inui!
We know you're in there.

25
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,597
[LACKEY] We're from the
Kyusei Group! So open up!

26
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,724
You better not make
Brother Huang wait.

27
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,434
‐‐[slap]
‐‐[LACKEY yelps]

28
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,193
[LACKEY gasps] Whoa, his head!
It's a gun, just like they said!

29
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,821
Shut yer mouth, idiot!

30
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,864
This is Kyusei Territory.

31
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,659
Extends like him
are a dime a dozen.

32
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,370
Try acting
professional for once.

33
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,582
So you're Juzo, the Resolver.

34
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,252
You're shorter than I expected.

35
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,421
[JUZO]
Huang, was it?

36
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,298
I understand you're a senior
member of the Kyusei Group.

37
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,676
So why are in you
a dump like this?

38
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,803
[MARY grunts]

39
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,431
If you're as good
as they say you are,

40
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,934
it shouldn't be too
difficult to figure out.

41
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,644
I'd like you to
resolve a certain

42
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,105
Extended problem we've got.

43
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,817
[JUZO]
Give me the details.

44
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,486
As of late, there've
been several attacks.

45
00:03:56,528 --> 00:04:01,032
All of them on our turf and
all of them involving children.

46
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,118
While none of them were killed,

47
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,872
each one had their arm and
leg extensions ripped off.

48
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,875
[JUZO]
Pretty heinous.

49
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,587
Yeah. And on top of that, every
one of 'em's unconscious still,

50
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,131
so we can't ask them anything.

51
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,551
But the real problem is this.

52
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,887
The culprit, whoever they are,

53
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,056
keeps displaying the
limbs in public places.

54
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,933
According to witnesses,

55
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,145
the way they're strung up
makes 'em look like puppets.

56
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,982
Based on the attacks,
we're sure it's Spitzbergen,

57
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,610
the anti‐Extended tech group.

58
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,569
They don't like the fact

59
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,530
we control the black
market on extensions.

60
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,657
They're taunting us.

61
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,619
Look, even though they say
they're a political group,

62
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,078
it's really obvious.

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,706
These guys are
nothin' but terrorists.

64
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,666
You understand, don't you?

65
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,378
Bottom line‐‐
we need to know about

66
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,882
everything that's going
on in our territory.

67
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,217
[JUZO]
Wish I could help.

68
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,468
[HUANG]
Hm?

69
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,555
[JUZO] What makes you think
I could find out anything?

70
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,058
I don't even know why
my head's like this.

71
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,228
Heh! You gotta be some
kind of loose cannon

72
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,648
talkin' that way to
a senior member of the Kyusei.

73
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,525
You either have some
powerful connections

74
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,736
behind you or don't
care about your life.

75
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,616
[JUZO] Just don't have a reason
to put a high price on it.

76
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,913
Heh. Here's the thing.

77
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,333
It's embarrassing, but
we lost some of our own‐‐

78
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,795
combat‐rated Extended
we sent as lookouts.

79
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,131
Since none of the brats
that were attacked

80
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,052
are conscious yet, we don't
know what we're up against.

81
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,810
[JUZO] You want me to find
the perp and take 'em out.

82
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,817
That's what I'm askin'.
You'd be doin' us a favor.

83
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,571
Oh. Heard you had
a beef with Beruhren, too.

84
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,074
Maybe we could help you
smooth things out with them.

85
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,411
[LACKEY]
Hey, bastard!

86
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,788
You answer him when
he talks to you, got it?

87
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,708
Go smoke on your own time!

88
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,834
[JUZO]
It's funny.

89
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:20,046
I was having déjà vu, like I've
had this conversation before.

90
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,134
[JUZO]
I do appreciate the offer.

91
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,345
After all, we're talking
about the Beruhren Corp,

92
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,556
the true owners of the city.

93
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,391
And I've been
racking my chamber,

94
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,437
trying to deal with a
problem that's way beyond me.

95
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:40,650
But my philosophy's always
been "wipe your own ass."

96
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,110
My suggestion:

97
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,280
You oughta protect
your territory yourself.

98
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,492
[JUZO] By the way, you
guys want some coffee?

99
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,370
Tastes like shit, but the
mob's been driving up prices

100
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,082
making it cost a fortune.
Still, you're welcome to a cup.

101
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,167
[LACKEY]
All right, wise guy.

102
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,878
How 'bout my gun
does some talking? Uh!

103
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,087
Brother.

104
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,298
[HUANG grunts]

105
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,592
[MARY gasping]

106
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,260
[HUANG grunts]

107
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,264
[HUANG grunts]

108
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,777
[HUANG laughs]
You're one tough son of a gun.

109
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,614
I'll give ya that. How am I
supposed to stare a guy down

110
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,367
when I don't even
know where his eyes are?

111
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,827
[JUZO]
Yeah. I get that a lot.

112
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,664
[LACKEY] We're leaving?
Are you sure about this?

113
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,707
[HUANG]
Gun head's got a point.

114
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,960
We'll take care of the problem.

115
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,170
I mean, if we can't
protect our turf,

116
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,674
how're we supposed to
tell others what to do?

117
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,384
On top of that,

118
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,470
I'd rather not duke it
out in this apartment...

119
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,472
...considering
that young engineer

120
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,392
has helped out our
boys in the past.

121
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,560
[MARY nervously chuckles]

122
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,106
[HUANG] You may not realize
it, but I like you, Resolver.

123
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:05,694
Even so, there're rules
that gotta be followed.

124
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,196
If you want to hide
something valuable here,

125
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,241
it's best not to
start any trouble.

126
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,037
[JUZO] Thanks for the
advice. I'll remember it.

127
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,789
[LACKEY]
This isn't over!

128
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,751
[door closes]

129
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,298
[MARY]
You think it was smart?

130
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,092
Turning down their job?

131
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,803
[JUZO] That wasn't
Spitzbergen's handiwork.

132
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,515
No question, the culprit's
definitely an Extended.

133
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,934
[JUZO] Yeah. And a group
so adamantly opposed

134
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,855
to the technology wouldn't
use one for their dirty work.

135
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,356
Then you mean...

136
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:47,193
[JUZO] My guess is that it's
Beruhren sending me a message.

137
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,988
[JUZO] They'll probably
continue hurting kids

138
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,948
till they find Tetsuro.

139
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,658
That's insane!

140
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,909
[thudding]

141
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,119
[MARY gasps]

142
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,581
Hey, kid! What're you doing?

143
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,583
It's too soon for
you to stand up!

144
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,918
[TETSURO]
No. I can't let them.

145
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,086
[MARY]
Huh?

146
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,631
[TETSURO] If children are being
attacked all because of me,

147
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,508
I can't stay here.

148
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,886
I have to do something about it.

149
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,971
I won't sit by!

150
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,226
All right, look.

151
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,354
You're a good kid, and I
understand your frustration,

152
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,066
but no good will come of getting
mixed up with up Beruhren.

153
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,193
You can trust me on this.

154
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,945
See, I know a guy
who shall remain nameless,

155
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,947
and they're in
neck deep already.

156
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,533
[JUZO]
So what do you plan on doing?

157
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,869
Sure, your thoughts
are admirable,

158
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,830
but I hope you're not
asking me to risk my life

159
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,625
just because you can't
do anything yourself.

160
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,961
C'mon, Juzo! Why'd you
have to word it like that?

161
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,006
[JUZO] Achieving justice without
putting your life on the line‐‐

162
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,716
that's a pipe dream.

163
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,012
[grunts]

164
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,972
[TETSURO]
You're absolutely right.

165
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:58,890
And at the moment,

166
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,769
I can't even stand without
somebody helping me.

167
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,815
But does that mean...
everyone who's down and out

168
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,818
should give up hope of
ever getting out of the gutters?

169
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,239
[TETSURO]
When I escaped the facility,

170
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,159
it was hard enough
trying to save myself.

171
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,787
I couldn't help
any of the others.

172
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:28,253
[TETSURO] No. I didn't
even try to save them.

173
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,756
Where exactly is
this facility located?

174
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,550
[TETSURO]
I don't know.

175
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,677
I was running through
dark underground passages

176
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,554
trying to evade my captors,

177
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,765
and somehow I
ended up in the city.

178
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,059
All I know is that Beruhren
has been taking people

179
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,521
and illegally
experimenting on them.

180
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,859
I have no memory from before
I was sent to that place,

181
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,112
but if I'm the CEO's
son, like you say I am,

182
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,283
then it's my responsibility
to stop what's going on!

183
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,245
I can't allow them to
ruin more innocent lives.

184
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:06,457
Juzo Inui, I want
to formally hire you.

185
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,794
Will you lend me your
strength one more time?

186
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,628
[MARY]
Uhh...

187
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,880
[JUZO]
So that's what you plan to do

188
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,007
with your hard‐earned freedom?

189
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,926
[TETSURO] If I tried going
to the Security Bureau

190
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:21,097
or the press, Beruhren
would just erase my existence.

191
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,891
Since I managed to escape,

192
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,602
I have to stop them from
harming any more children.

193
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,564
[JUZO]
I've already come this far.

194
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:35,820
[JUZO] I'll protect you until
you can stand on your own again.

195
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,449
But you know, I'm not
running a charity here.

196
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,744
I can't be responsible for
saving complete strangers.

197
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,457
[TETSURO]
Your fee... Wait!

198
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,543
There's gotta be a way we can
remove Harmony and sell it!

199
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,962
I bet it'd go for a good price!

200
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,673
[JUZO sighs]
One problem‐‐

201
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,343
we don't even know
if it'll come out.

202
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,510
[TETSURO gasps]

203
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,679
Looks like the device
was surgically embedded

204
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,890
in your medulla oblongata.

205
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,977
If we attempt to remove
it, well, it's dangerous.

206
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,814
[JUZO] Your heart's in
the right place, Tetsuro.

207
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,193
[JUZO] There aren't many
people who'd be as noble

208
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,613
if they experienced the same
things that were done to you.

209
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,867
[JUZO] The sooner you can
come to terms with that,

210
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,994
the sooner you can move on.

211
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,166
[JUZO] Before you start
worrying about others,

212
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,627
you should take
care of yourself.

213
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,429
[JUZO grunts]
It's even worse when it's cold.

214
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,143
[JUZO]
Tetsuro, are you‐‐?

215
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,272
[MARY groans]

216
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,149
[JUZO groaning]

217
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,276
[MARY]
You okay?

218
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,736
What's going on? Hey, Juzo!

219
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,030
[gasps] He's out.

220
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,996
[MARY]
Uh...

221
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,129
Um, what's going on here?

222
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,381
[TETSURO]
You won't have any complaints

223
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,801
if I can stand on
my own, right, Juzo?

224
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,391
[TETSURO] Sorry for causing
trouble. Thank you, Mary.

225
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:32,812
So that was Tetsuro just now?

226
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,523
And he jumped bodies?

227
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:43,406
That's how Harmony's activated.
He really can control Extended.

228
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,415
[TETSURO] I feel pretty lousy
having to steal like this,

229
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,500
but it's for the
good of the children.

230
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,839
[TETSURO] If I had stuck
around any longer,

231
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,801
Mary might've forced me to
sever my connection with Juzo.

232
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,845
The downside to all
this is that my body

233
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,973
is vulnerable while I'm
controlling another form.

234
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,312
[WORKER A] Are you
from the Security Bureau?

235
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:18,274
Nah, not with a head like
that. As if it matters.

236
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,277
Kids get attacked around here
pretty much on a daily basis,

237
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,821
but it's always been that way.

238
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,534
Yeah, this neighborhood
weeds them out.

239
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,787
I remember watching
my kid sister go chasing

240
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,581
after a bug or something
about ten years ago.

241
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,583
She never came back home.

242
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,794
Ah! Here it is!

243
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,213
[WORKER A]
Now let's get a closer look

244
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,590
at that body of yours.

245
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,677
You got some great parts that're
rare even on the black market.

246
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,762
[HOODLUMS chuckling]

247
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,847
[WORKER A]
There's no need to worry.

248
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,226
I promise any leftover scraps
we don't want you can keep.

249
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,811
I really oughta be going!

250
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,854
[HOODLUMS yelling]

251
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,691
[WORKER A]
Hey! Where're you going?

252
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,111
I promise it won't hurt!

253
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,904
[HOODLUM D]
Shit! We lost him!

254
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,781
[HOODLUM E] Don't worry.
With a face like that,

255
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,324
he can't stay hidden.

256
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,534
[HOODLUM D]
I'll keep goin' this way.

257
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,703
The rest of you,
go check out the main stairs!

258

That was close!

00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,255
[TETSURO]
What's with this body though?

261
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,050
It has way too many channels
making it hard to control.

262
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,219
Is it an off‐brand sub‐brain?

263
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,514
Nevermind!
I've gotta hide this head.

264
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,434
If only I had some kind of mask.

266
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,773
[TETSURO]
Amazing.

267
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,651
I can still see
everything even with this on.

268
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,782
[ANNE]
This way!

You can't just use
others for your goals,

then toss them aside
when you're done!

[TETSURO]
Amazing.

[ANNE]
Ende, are you okay?

291
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,212
Yes. I'm fine, Anne.

292
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,630
Listen.

293
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,007
They said they'd change
your body back to normal.

294
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,469
But before they do, we have to
finish the job we were assigned.

295
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,515
Which means there can't be
any witnesses left behind.

to lend it to me again.

Hey, you two.

What're you talking about?

299
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:09,195
Anyone who sees us
should be killed, right?

00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,322
Yes, Ende.

Because after all, we have

Don't tell me...

00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,441
I can tell you were a test
subject at the facility.

00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,111
Who are you?

313
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,572
How could you
know that? Unless you...

314
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,199
[TETSURO] I used to be
one of Beruhren's prisoners

315
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,326
and I know what they can do.

316
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,705
But with some help,
I was able to break free.

317

And now I wanna help.
I wanna save the two of you!

318

No thanks. You're crazy.

319
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,964
I have no idea why
you stopped that Extended

320
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,757
from the Kyusei group for us,

321
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,011
but we are not
captives of Beruhren.

That's the only place
we can call our home.

you've seen the two of us,

00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,226
[PERSON A]
A renegade Extended!

[ENDE wailing]

345
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,192
Ende!

346
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,571
[ENDE]
Anne.

347
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,783
It hurts. My head hurts so much.

348
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:05,746
Please, I need your
hand. Don't let go.

349
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,958
No. Where are you?

350
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,545
Don't let go of me.

351
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,048
Everything's okay, Ende!
I'm right here with you!

352
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,258
Anne?

353
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,093
[ANNE]
You have to listen to me.

354
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,554
We need to lure
this Tetsuro out,

355
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,931
then we can go back
to the facility.

356
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,559
There you'll be
taken good care of.

357
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,728
They'll make you feel better.

358
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,274
Yes. You're... right.

359
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,831
[CUNNINGHAM sighs]
What is the meaning of this?

360
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,291
[ANNE]
I already told you!

361
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,251
Look! Ende's at her limit!

362
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,337
Please, take her to the
facility to be treated!

363
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,257
[CUNNINGHAM] Did you forget
the roles you were assigned?

364
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,427
Her task was to ambush children
in the Kyusei territory in order

365
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,346
to send a message and
lure the boy out of hiding.

366
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,766
Whereas your one job
was to keep this failure

367
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,186
from going berserk and
drawing unnecessary attention.

368
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,854
But it seems this
simple assignment

369
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,565
proved too difficult
for you to carry out.

370
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,733
[ANNE grunts]

371
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,152
Your abilities allowed
you to operate covertly

372
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,069
in the Kyusei Pit

373
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,280
where 90 percent of
the locals are Extended,

374
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,532
yet somehow you still
managed to cause a scene‐‐

375
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,909
meaning the two of you failed

376
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,119
and are complete
disappointments!

377
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:31,040
But we left messages just
like we were instructed to!

378
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,374
If Ende's treated,
we can go back‐‐

379
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,001
The company has no use for gears

380
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,170
that do not fulfill
their assigned role.

381
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,089
You can't! If you
separate us, Ende will...

382
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,549
[gasps]

383
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,383
Ende!

384
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,803
Let go! She has to
receive her treatments!

385
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,679
[CUNNINGHAM]
It's too late!

386
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,391
Both test subjects are
to be immediately retired.

387
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,226
No...

388
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,560
[TETSURO]
That's enough!

389
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,271
[HENCHMAN A groans]

390
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,442
Hey... How'd you...?

391
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,404
[TETSURO] These are children!
Not soulless gears!

392
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,706
[ENDE] Hey, Anne.
My body, where'd it go?

393
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,583
[CUNNINGHAM] What do
you know, Master Tetsuro,

394
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,209
it seems you're fit
to be a tool after all!

395
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,421
[TETSURO] It doesn't matter.
I want to save these children!

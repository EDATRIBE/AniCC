perfectly frank with you, sir,

178

179
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,653
She’s rapidly losing strength,

180

and nothing seems
to help her condition.

181

nine unidentified men and women

190
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,711
gathered in a building
believed to be dio’s hideout.

191
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,913
Apparently they came
and left together.

192

nine more people?!

194

Man #1: We have
no clue who they are.

195
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,555
The spy who reported this
was killed shortly after,

196
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,724
and the mansion where they met
has been vacated.

197
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,194
We’ve had no luck
in locating these individuals.

198
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:55,930
We thought about tailing them,

199
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,798
but since our spies
aren’t stand users,

200
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,666

it would be too dangerous.

201

are stand users?!

202

203
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,104

204
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,605
That would be impossible.

207

I’ve been suspecting
that one belongs to dio,

but now i’m not sure. Avdol?

209
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,117

210

my head around this.

it seems that dio’s head

to his new body yet.

But that monster
would never run from us.

215

He’s far too conceited
for something like that.

within his power

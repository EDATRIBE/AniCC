Why didn’t it spill over?!

350

d’arby:
Your question’s confusing.

351
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,881
What do you mean,
why didn’t it spill?

352
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:56,617
You saw the result
with your own eyes.

353
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,853
Jotaro: As far as I know,
he didn’t do anything devious.

354
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:02,189
I was watching him
with star platinum.

355
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,792
It’s hard to believe, but he
dropped it in fair and square.

356

There’s no doubt.

357

Joseph: But how did he do it?

358
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,699
I’m positive I added
enough liquid to the glass

359
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,135
that one more coin
would make it spill.

360
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:18,272

it shouldn’t have spilled.

You’ve noticed it too late,

00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:40,681
Avdol: Eh, what? Something’s
wrong with the glass?

397
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:41,982
Jotaro: This is the reason

398
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,917
the coin didn’t make
the booze spill over.

399
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,287
If you look at the bottom
of the glass,

400
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,889
you’ll see that there’s
a tiny bit of chocolate on it.

401
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,891
He must have found a way
to stick it on

402
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:53,360
when he was inspecting
the glass and coins

403
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,395

of the game.

the rules by now.

you never get caught in the act.

406
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:03,838
Avdol: What? I don’t understand.
How could a piece of chocolate

407
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,973
allow him to drop in
an extra coin?

408
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:07,908
Jotaro: Well, at this point,
it’s melted,

409
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:10,076
but it used to be a solid chunk

410
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,312
stuck to the bottom
of the glass,

411
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,381
just enough
to slightly tilt the glass,

412
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,384
but not quite enough
for us to notice the change.

413
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,885
Once the chocolate
started to melt,

414
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,622
the glass came to be level
with the table.

415
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:24,791
With the glass leveled out,
the booze began to settle,

416
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:26,994
which made enough room
for another coin.

417

Avdol: W-what the hell?!

00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,664
b-but that
doesn’t make any sense!

419
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,799
How could he have known
the chocolate would melt

420
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,601
right when he needed it to?

421
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,505
Jotaro: He influenced things
by using the sun.

422
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,040
It slipped my notice.

423
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,341
when he moved
to the right side of the table,

424
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,078
he allowed the sun to shine
directly onto the chocolate,

425
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,846
thereby melting it.

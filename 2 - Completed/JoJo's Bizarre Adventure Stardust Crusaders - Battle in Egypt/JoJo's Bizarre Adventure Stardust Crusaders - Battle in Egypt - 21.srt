360

our precise location?

361
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,440
Joseph: Not quite.
He stole the body

362
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,742
of my grandfather,
Jonathan joestar.

363
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,144
I can sense his body,

364

but I can’t tell
if he’s nearby or far away.

365
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,717
I have a general feeling, but I
don’t know exactly where he is.

366

It’s like when we got to Cairo

367

I couldn’t pinpoint his lair.

the same thing goes for dio.

369
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,627
all he knows
is that we’re nearby,

370
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,497
but he’s unable to tell
the difference between us,

371
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,833
and he probably doesn’t know
we’ve separated,

372
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,902

for certain.

more horrific than we

However, we know
two things about it.

455

First, his stand
doesn’t have the reach

456
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,781
of my hierophant green
or your hermit purple.

457
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:17,384
It’s a close-range power stand,
like star platinum,

458
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,920
and has a range
of about ten meters.

459
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,955
Second, it attacked
with its fist,

460
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:25,226
so it doesn’t use projectile
weapons, like bullets.

461

if we can sneak up on him

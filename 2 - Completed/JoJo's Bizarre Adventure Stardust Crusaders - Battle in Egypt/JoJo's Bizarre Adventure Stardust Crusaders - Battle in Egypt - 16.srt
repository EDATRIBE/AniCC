2
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:03,804
Something’s coming this way!

I don’t know who you are,

definitely not normal!

Joseph: Polnareff, stop it!

7

make short work of you.

welcome to our abode.

We’ve been expecting you.

11
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,695
How rude of me.

12
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,197
I am the Butler of this mansion.

13
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,866
You may call me d’arby.

15

d’arby: Yes.
I am the younger d’arby.

16

It might interest you to know

17
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,008
the d’arby whom you defeated
upon your arrival was...

18
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,044
My older brother.

19
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,211
( Men gasp )

20
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,446
Polnareff: So there isn’t

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,215
just one filou
in the d’arby family!

22
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,950
Avdol: So I take it you’re here

23
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,151
to avenge
your brother’s defeat?

D’arby: No, not at all.

27
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,261
Such a thing is beneath me.

28
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:04,031
I would have assumed my brother
would share his motto with you--

29
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,867
"it is the deceived,
not the deceiver,

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,135
who holds the blame."

31
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,203
I, too, live by this adage.

32
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,940
My brother lost,
so he is the wrongdoer.

33
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:16,176
I harbor no ill will
toward any of you.

34
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,180
My brother is my brother,
and I am me,

35
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,848
two different individuals.

36
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,951
You see, my brother and I
were born ten years apart,

37
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,753
and while I did look up to him
to a certain extent,

38
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,956
he and I are
of different generations.

39
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,826
My brother tried to win
via old-fashioned deception,

40
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,995
but this method is
only useful against those

41
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,230
who are outdated
or inexperienced.

42
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,901
Master dio realized
this sad truth as well,

43
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,036
which is why
he kept me by his side

44
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,071
as his personal Butler.

45
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,306
Hmm. Forgive me.

46
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,775

If you wish to fight me,

50
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,383
then I invite you
to enter our manor.

Avdol: Stay on guard.

52
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,452
He’s even more conniving
than his brother.

jotaro:
There’s no time for games.

54
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,155
Take us to dio right now.

Joseph: Jotaro,
stay on your guard!

56
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,158
He’s up to something!

58
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:11,932

he just brought out his stand.

62
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,773
Joseph: It’s been a while
since we’ve seen one.

63
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,108
Avdol: Indeed. His stand
is physically showing itself.

64
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,379
Atum: I’ll let you decide.
Who shall be my first opponent?

65
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,314
polnareff:
As if we’d listen to you.

66
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,183
Jotaro, take this weirdo down.

67
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,122
D’arby: Let’s see.

68
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,191
I’ll wager that star platinum’s
first attack will...

69
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,960
Atum: ...Be with his left arm.

70

- ( Jotaro gasps )
- ( All gasp )

71
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,531
Atum: Oh, and it’ll be a punch.

72
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,567
How much would you care to bet?

73
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,902
Polnareff: Forget this.
Which arm doesn’t matter.

74
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,337
One punch will finish it.

75
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,138
Get him!

76
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,941
Let him have it already,
jotaro!

77

- ( Jotaro gasps )
- Joseph: What?

79
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,047
He was able to dodge it.

80
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,083
Polnareff: His speed is insane.

81
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,352
- Avdol: Impossible.
- ( Jotaro growls )

82
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,520
( D’arby laughs )

83
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,290
Well, that’s a bit of bad luck.

84
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,027
Regrettably, it appears
as though i’ve lost the bet.

85
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,196
Like my brother, I also enjoy
a round of gambling,

86
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,965
but luck is never on my side.

87
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,900
- ( Star platinum grunts )
- D’arby: Allow me to take you

88
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,502
to a wonderful world
to apologize.

89
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,806
Jotaro: What? A pit?

90
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,075
Avdol: Damn it!
It was all subterfuge.

91
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,243
Joseph: Jotaro!

92
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,347
He’s falling into the abyss!

93
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,183
We have to get him out of there!

94
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,551
( Both gasping )

95
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,919
D’arby: Have it your way.

96
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,121
The more the merrier,
and all that.

97
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,255
( Both yell )

polnareff:
Mr. Joestar, kakyoin, no!

99
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,294
Avdol: It’s too dangerous
for us to follow.

100
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,996
Joseph: Avdol, can you hear me?!

101
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,000
If you don’t hear from us
in ten minutes,

102
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,536
torch the mansion!
Do you understand me?!

103
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,906
Burn it to the ground, avdol!

104
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,175
Both: Mr. Joestar!

105
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,383
Joseph: Mm.

106
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,985
Jotaro: Mm.

( Waves lapping )

108
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,157
Joseph: Is this an illusion?

109
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,194
Are we still aboveground,
or did he pull us under?

110
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,496
Huh? ( Gasps )

111
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,231
- huh?
- ( Seabirds calling )

112
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,299
if this stuff
is really an illusion,

113
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,570
they’ve got water down.
This stuff feels so real.

114
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,473
What the hell is this guy
trying to accomplish here?

115
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:33,640
- Jotaro: Hmm?
- Joseph: Eh?

116
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,410
( D’arby chuckles )

117
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,350
Jotaro: Old man, kakyoin,

118
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,552
see if you can figure out
his ability.

119
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,222
his stand,
it knew without a doubt

120
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,591
that I would throw
a right-handed punch.

121
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,259
Do you know why?

122
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,593
Joseph: Hmm.

123
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,096
jotaro: If we
can’t figure it out soon,

124
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,199
we’re gonna lose. No doubt.

125

D’arby: Would you care
to wet your whistle?

126
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,870
They’re real, and I assure you
they’re not poisoned.

127
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,939
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

128
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,409
Joseph: Just answer this.
Are we inside the mansion?

129
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,910
D’arby: Yes, of course.

130
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,245
joseph:
Where in the mansion are we?

131
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,981
D’arby: I can’t tell you that.

132
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,249
Joseph: The basement?

133
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,950
D’arby: Perhaps.

134
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,385
Joseph: Hmm.

135
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,356
is this illusion
the work of a stand’s power?

136
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,957
D’arby: Yes, it is.

137
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,260
Joseph: Is all this
the doing of your stand?

138
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,528
D’arby: No, it isn’t.

139
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,996
Joseph: Is it dio’s stand?

140
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,130
D’arby: No, it isn’t.

141
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,365
Joseph: Whose stand, then?!

142
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,367
D’arby: I would rather
not reveal that.

143
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,236
Joseph: The speedwagon
foundation has reported

144
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,973
there are two to three
more stand users.

145
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,407
Is that accurate?

146
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,009
D’arby: I’d rather
not reveal that either.

147
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,112
( Joseph groans )
Well, you’re about as helpful

148
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,114
as a cramp in a relay race.

149
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:50,450
D’arby: If it means so much,
I could lie to you,

150
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,386
but unlike
my dearly defeated brother,

151
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,354
i’d prefer not to resort
to petty trickery.

00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,590
( Jotaro scoffs )

153
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,092
Joseph: Let me make sure
i’ve got this straight.

154
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,694
you’re saying
if we don’t defeat you,

155
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,496
we won’t be able
to get back to the real world?

156
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,699
D’arby: Heh. Exactly right.

157
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,134
You’ve pieced it together,
good sir.

158
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,203
Kakyoin: That obnoxious,
gentlemanly demeanor

159

is beginning
to wear thin on my nerves.

160
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,541
Joseph: You seem
to be forgetting

161
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,577
that it’s three against one.
We’re short on time,

162
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,346
so you’ll have to deal with
all of us attacking at once.

You should take a load off.

ordinary doll makers

giving too much away,

my brother’s collection

197

is rather uninspired.

212

221
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,827
( D’arby grumbles )
by the way,

222
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,564
i’m fairly certain you learned
this when you fought my brother,

223
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,834
but the human soul can be
a rather mysterious entity.

224
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,869
the moment
a person admits defeat,

225
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,438
their inner spirit dies,

226
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:00,574
and the soul loses
almost all vitality.

227
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:04,744
At that moment, I have the power
to rip the soul from the body,

228
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,081
and that’s the fundamental
mechanism of our stands!

229
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,450
Joseph: I’ve heard enough!

230

to a bloody pulp

232

233
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,224
D’arby: But first listen
to what I have to say.

234
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,293
Atum: Surely the fact
that you’re under my control

235
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,895
hasn’t escaped your notice.

236
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:22,897
( Men gasp )

237
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,166
D’arby: Jotaro, as I recall,

238
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,868
you were quite shocked
when I knew exactly which arm

239
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,569
you were going
to attack me with,

240
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,871
and from where i’m standing,

241
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,806
it seems you still
haven’t figured it out.

242
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,142
Atum: You were shaken
by my prowess,

243
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,911
and I was able to give your soul
a little love tap.

244
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:41,215
What do you think I did
when I touched your soul?

245
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,283
( Jotaro gasping )

246
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,421
Kakyoin: W-what the--

247
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,489
Joseph: The hell’d
you do to his arm?

248
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,291
D’arby: I’ve done nothing

249
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,761
but embed atum’s hand
inside jotaro’s soul.

250
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,630
I could crush your right arm
with a thought

251
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,332
and, in doing so,
make master dio very happy,

252
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,536
but if I did, I wouldn’t
be able to defend myself

253
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,338
against kakyoin and Joseph
and would most certainly perish.

254
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:09,309

to happen, would we, gentlemen?

255

( Joseph growls )

256
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,913
So here’s a suggestion.

257
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,383
Everyone, let’s play a game
with our souls as collateral.

258
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,417
Joseph: What?

259
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,886
D’arby: If you defeat me,

260
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,489
i solemnly swear
to release jotaro’s arm.

261
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:24,025
Jotaro: Ah, good grief.

262
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,294
so, according to you,
i’m already under your control.

263
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,496
Well, I have news
for you, d’arby.

264
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,633
You’re gonna regret picking
a fight with me and my friends.

265
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,867
Let’s end this!

266
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,870
D’arby: Yes, yes,
your righteous anger

267
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,439
is all well and good,
but i’d rather hear you

268
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,941
say the words,
"i’ll bet my soul on this game."

269
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,876
by the way,
I have another request,

270
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,578
- if you’d indulge me.
- jotaro: Eh?

271
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,846
- D’arby: Kakyoin...
- Kakyoin: Hmm?

272
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,048
D’arby: You shall be
my first opponent.

273

jotaro: Hey,
what are you talking about?

274
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,918
Your fight is with me, buddy,

275
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,688
so don’t try
and pass the buck to kakyoin.

276

Mr. Joestar are family,

277

but kakyoin is decidedly not.

278
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,029
i’d prefer kakyoin
not back out of our arrangement

279
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,430
and attack me with his stand

280
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,298
after i’ve taken
both of your souls,

281
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,302

of familial attachment.

282

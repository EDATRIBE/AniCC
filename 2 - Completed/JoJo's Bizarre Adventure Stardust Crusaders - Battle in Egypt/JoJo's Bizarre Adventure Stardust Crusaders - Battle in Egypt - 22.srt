in common with my star platinum.

354
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,238
We’re not long-range fighters,

355
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,707
but we have incredible power
and precision.

356
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,743
Dio: If i’m being honest,
i’ve always had a desire

357
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:39,046
to see how much
stronger the world is

358
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,414
compared with star platinum,

359
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,784
but it seems pointless
to compare them now.

360
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,319
Jotaro: Wait. Are you serious?

361
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:49,323
all you did was
give me a love tap on the leg,

362
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,325
and you ripped
my 20,000-yen pants.

363
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,261
Dio: For the life of me,
I can’t figure out

364
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,129
why you joestars
are so stubborn.

365
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:59,833
Fine. I shall accept
your cheap provocation.

366
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,136
Let our comparison resume.

367
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,138
( Star platinum grunting )

368
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:10,778
Ora! Ora!

00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,281
- ( Yelling )
- ( The world grunting )

370
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:20,020
( Dio chuckles )
Comparing our punching speed?

371
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,289
( The world yelling )

372
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,390

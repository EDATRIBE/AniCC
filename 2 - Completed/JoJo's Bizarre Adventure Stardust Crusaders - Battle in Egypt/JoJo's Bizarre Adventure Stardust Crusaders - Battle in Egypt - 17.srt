00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,053
Your swings are pathetic.
don’t lie.

177
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,121
This is your first time
playing, isn’t it?

178
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,467
- Umpire: Strike two.
- ( Joseph gasps )

179
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,969
and now you’re
actually swinging the bat

180
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,737
after the catcher
has caught the ball.

181
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,472
You don’t know
what you’re doing!

182
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,641
Damn it, jotaro. I was right.

183
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,277
You don’t know a video game
from a hole in the ground.

184
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,079
Umpire: Strike. Batter out.

185
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,282
joseph: Jotaro,
it’s time to get serious!

186
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,018
Stop trying to act cool,
and use your blasted head!

187
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,388
You bet your soul on this game,
so if you think you can back out

188
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,756
due to lack of experience,
think again.

189
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,291
Jotaro: Good grief.

190
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,027
This is the worst pep talk
i’ve ever heard.

191
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,728
You should be more encouraging.

192
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,764
try something like,
"it’s only the first inning.

193
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,532
You can still
make a comeback."

194
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,002
Joseph: What the hell’s going
through that head of yours?

195
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,671
You can’t possibly rely solely
on star platinum’s reflexes

196
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,140
to win this game, can you?
Think about it.

197
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,243
You don’t know the first thing
about video games.

198
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,677
how are you
supposed to beat him?

199
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,213
What’s your plan, jotaro?

200
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,514
Answer me, damn it!

201
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,151
do you have a way
to beat this weirdo or not?

202
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,586
D’arby: Jotaro...

203
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,221
- Jotaro: Hmm?
- ( Joseph groans )

204
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,356
d’arby: Listen,
if your strategy is to trick me

205
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,725
by pretending
to be an amateur,

206
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:21,662
let me inform you
that it isn’t going to work.

207
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,631
I’d never be foolish enough
to let my guard down.

208
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,667
Even if you were
a helpless child,

209
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,001
it wouldn’t happen.

210
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,670
A soul is at stake.

211
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,171
Jotaro: Old man.

212
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,673
Joseph: Eh? Huh?

213
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,442
Jotaro: Since you wanted
to know, I don’t have a plan.

214
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:40,146
However, if I did have one,
the only thing it would involve

215
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,215
would be knocking the nose
straight off the face

216
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,350
of this condescending,

217
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,185
over-inflated
douche bag of a prick

218
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,587
taking up space beside me.

219
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,090
all I care about is
getting kakyoin’s soul back.

220
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,192
I’ll do whatever it takes.

221
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,195
D’arby: You talk a big game,

222
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:57,364
but it’s still
the top of the first inning,

223
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,732
and you have one out.

224
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,700
The match is far from over.

225
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,203
and since you haven’t
played before, you should know

226
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:07,274
that if you fall more
than 11 points behind, you lose.

227
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,415
announcer:
Second batter, number 3.

228
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,752
Umpire: Strike.

229
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,321
joseph: Damn,
he’s getting even worse.

230
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,556
That time, he swung the bat

231
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,424
over 40 centimeters
above the ball.

232
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,659
How’s he so bad?

233
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,727
Umpire: Strike two.

234
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,496
joseph: What?
It wasn’t even close.

235
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:36,704
Umpire: Strike three.
you’re out.

236
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,440
Joseph: It’s all over.

237
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,443
Jotaro’s no match
for someone like d’arby.

238
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,611
This massacre is like
being forced to watch

239
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,413
a group of high school
baseball champs

240
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,715
go head-to-head with kids
from the knitting club!

241
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,618
It’s pathetic.

242
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,752
Umpire: Strike one.

243
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,353
Strike two.

244
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,424
D’arby: So it wasn’t a bluff.

245
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,026
He really is a beginner.
This is too easy.

246
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,230
In the same way a judo pro
can Gauge his opponent’s skill

247
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,599
simply by looking
at the way he wears his gi,

248
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,400
I can read him like a book,

249
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:12,005
and chapter one is called,
"jotaro, the video game novice."

250
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:16,076
all the same,
I refuse to let my guard down.

251
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,613
I’m aware of the weaknesses
of every batter in this game.

252
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:23,316
Next will be a low pitch
to the outside.

253
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,419
I’ll throw my best pitch,

254
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:28,221
the four-seam fast ball,
and strike him out.

255
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,656
It’s the first inning.

256
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,126
Two outs, two strikes,
and no fouls.

257
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,062
- Here comes my next pitch.
- Jotaro: Go right ahead.

258
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,265
I’ve pretty much gotten the hang
of batting with the controller.

259
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,234
d’arby: Wait.
What did he just say?

260
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,636
I must have heard him wrong.

261
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,139
What does he mean,
"got the hang of it"?

262
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,077
Surely, he couldn’t have...

263
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:53,114
What is he talking about?

264
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,547
What does he mean?

265
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,455
What?!

266
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,223
Joseph: Jotaro!

267
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:05,760
Jotaro: All right. I’m really
starting to enjoy this game.

268
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,561
Joseph: What in the--
it can’t be!

269
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:11,598
it’s going!
The ball is still going!

270
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:13,701
D’arby: It just
doesn’t make sense.

271
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,203
What did he mean by,
"got the hang of it"?

272
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,539
"Got the hang of it"?
"Got the hang of it"?

273
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,576
( Joseph yells )

274
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,377
He--he did it!

275
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,314
I don’t know how,
but he did it!

276
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,049
( Laughs )

277
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,351
Announcer: Home run!

278
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,457
( D’arby sputters )

279
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:40,761
Joseph: Home run!
It’s a home run!

280
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,562
( Laughs )

281
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,799
( D’arby growls )
Jotaro, damn you.

282
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,470
( D’arby grunts )
jotaro...

283
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,306
Did I really hear you correctly?

284
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,408
say something.
It sounded like you’d,

285
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,576
"pretty much gotten
the hang of batting."

286
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,545
Jotaro: I don’t feel
like repeating myself.

287
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:03,651
D’arby: He was a beginner
when we started this game,

288
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:06,187
and yet he’s claiming
to have learned

289
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,456
proper swinging technique
in only eight pitches.

290
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:13,593
Jotaro kujo has all the speed
and dexterity of star platinum.

291
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,964
Now I know why master dio
finds him to be problematic

292
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,199
and why my brother lost.
( Groans )

293
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,538
( Chuckles )
Interesting.

294
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,541
I couldn’t have asked
for a more fitting opponent.

295
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:31,044
But as naturally gifted
as you may be,

296
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,547
you made a critical mistake
by revealing your talents

297
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,116
so early in the game,

298
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,019
a mistake
that will cost you dearly.

299
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,487
( Chuckles )

300
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,491
Let’s resume the game, jotaro.

301
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:47,261
♪

302
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,265
Joseph: Yes, he did it!

303
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,066
That’s my boy!

304
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,202
Another home run
right out of the park!

305
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,337
Talk about a comeback.

306
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,206
Four runs in the first inning.

307
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,008
looks like you’ve got
this game in the bag, jotaro.

308
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:05,012
Keep it up, and we’ll be
out of here in no time.

309
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:08,081
hey, d’arby,
you’ll just ignore me,

310
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:11,085
but i’ll say it anyway,
because i’m a nice guy.

311
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,419
I’m giving you an out.

312
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,955
All you have to do
is return kakyoin’s soul

313
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,457
and take us to dio
of your own volition.

314
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:20,995
If you cooperate,
no harm will befall you.

315
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,167
- huh?
- Jotaro: Hmm?

316
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,202
D’arby: For all his faults,

317
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,204
my brother was a master gambler.

318
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,140
He made conning people
into an art form.

319
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,641
You’d think his younger brother

320
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:36,577
would be perfect
to practice on,

321
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,045
but you’d be wrong.

322
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,114
he never asked me
to play one game of poker.

323
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,416
No, I was never asked

324
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,952
to play any games
of the gambling persuasion.

325
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,954
Any guesses why?

326
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,555
( Both grunt )

327
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,559
D’arby: When I was 15,
I caught my brother

328
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:53,694
putting his oh-so-predictable
moves on my girlfriend.

329
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:57,531
he was ten years older,
but I beat him to a bloody pulp.

330
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,099
I broke his ribs

331
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,368
and proceeded to kick him
until he spat blood.

332
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,437
The last thing my brother
said to me was how sorry he was.

333
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,373
Any idea why?

334
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,009
Joseph: Would you please
cut to the chase already?

335
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:12,279
D’arby: Even as kids, my brother
had the good sense to realize

336
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,681
that he’d never have
what it took to beat me.

337
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:18,219
The reason for that is about
to become abundantly clear.

338
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:22,123
At this moment, you have
a false sense of confidence

339
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,057
due to the home run you hit,

340
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,460
but deep down,
you feel a sense of unease,

341
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,628
not unlike
what my brother felt.

342
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:31,632
My prowess is beginning
to worry you, isn’t it?

343
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:34,368
Right now you’re coming
to a daunting conclusion

344
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,703
about the game’s outcome,
aren’t you, jotaro?

345
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:39,039
Joseph: What the hell

Number 15 is out,
and number 77 is in.

348
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,048
77 is a power pitcher

349
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:52,052
with a Max pitch speed
of 165 kilometers per hour.

350
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,255

the pitch i’ll throw.

will throw a forkball,

353

right down the middle.

to come barreling down center.

366
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,295

going to change direction?

is driving me crazy!

You swung!

369
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,502
You bought his act
and bet on the forkball!

370
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:45,439
it’s still going.
It actually is a fastball!

371
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,442

He had already seen through me

381
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,199
and knew I would swing
expecting a forkball,

382
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,434
so he switched it up
to a fastball.

383
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,103
But he has a point, though.

384

i’m not sure how,
but he knew star platinum

that he can read your mind?

be aiming now, jotaro,

Will you throw it high

go a long way

an opponent’s next move,

to do it perfectly,

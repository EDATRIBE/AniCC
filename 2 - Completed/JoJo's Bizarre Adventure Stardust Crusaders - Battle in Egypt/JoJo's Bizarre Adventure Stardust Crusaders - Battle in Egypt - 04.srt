up and vanished by yourself.

An enemy stand user?!

Polnareff: It’s all over now.

367

He said his stand
was known as the god Anubis.

368
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,487
It was able to literally phase
through objects and cut them

369

in its crosshairs.

370

making off with the sword?!

steal stuff in this place.

so you decided

to bring the sword
with you after all?

turn it in to the police.

1
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,773
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,235
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

3
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,028
But out of that long,
morbid list,

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,615
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

5
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,297
They're giving this
everything they have,

6
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,882
and they're only kids!

7
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,384
I put my faith in you.

8
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,970
I believed you could
take the fall for me!

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,180
What the hell's
gotten into you?!

10
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,517
[TAMAKI]
I cared for you so much.

11
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,313
Lieutenant Rekka,
why are you doing this?

12
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,320
What do we know?

13
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,698
An Infernal was seen
walking the streets.

14
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,576
There's fire where it
turned. Let's find it.

15
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,373
[REKKA]
Tamaki! Can you keep up?

16
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,542
Uh, yes, sir!
Don't worry about me!

17
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,377
There's an Infernal
somewhere close.

18
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,087
Keep an eye out
and stick with us!

19
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,798
Understood, Lieutenant
Rekka. I'll do that!

20
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,096
[REKKA] There it is!
Leave this one to me!

21
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,932
Hold it, Rekka!
Don't rush to rushing in!

22
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,440
Start the prayer.

23
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,192
The flame is the soul's breath.

24
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,069
Ashes thou wert and art.

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:55,324
[LI, REKKA] May thy soul return
to the great flame of fire!

26
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,868
<i>Látom</i>.

27
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,880
You're way too reckless.
Why do you jump in like that?

28
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,592
I get to be reckless 'cause
I trust you to watch my back!

29
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,386
Well, when you charge ahead of
me, your back's all I can see.

30
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,387
My stars!

31
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,555
You can't just brush this off

32
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,390
with one of your
grinning star smiles.

33
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,476
My stars?

34
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,352
My stars!

35
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,519
[KARIM]
I don't care how flashily you...

36
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,607
[TAMAKI] They all rely on
each other. They're so cool!

37
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,610
I need you to die, Tamaki!

38
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:36,281
[TAMAKI] Somebody...
please just make him stop.

39
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,116
Help me, please.

40
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,226
Hey, there, Tamaki.

41
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,727
You all right?

42
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,185
[REKKA]
My stars!

43
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,562
Oh, no!

44
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,528
Lieutenant Hoshimiya, care to
explain what's going on here?

45
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,239
Don't interfere with my work!

46
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,783
Or you'll feel my Star Fist Jab!

47
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,384
It's all over, Lieutenant!

48
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,302
With the hero
"Catch‐the‐Dirtbag‐

49
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,388
Who's‐Been‐Turning‐
People‐Into‐Infernals" Man

50
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,057
on the scene,
there's nowhere to run!

51
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:49,766
Huh?

52
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,768
[REKKA growls]

53
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,271
I don't care if there's
nowhere to fall back to.

54
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,233
Because the only direction
I ever move is forward!

55
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,278
[SHINRA]
Then call me

56
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,489
"Keep‐That‐Murderer‐
From‐Moving‐at‐all" Man!

57
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,254
This is amazing.

58
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,298
He's holding his own
against Lieutenant Rekka;

59
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,049
they're fighting toe‐to‐toe.

60
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,596
I will not allow anyone to
interfere with our evangelism!

61
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,600
Shut up already.
Hot‐blooded son of a bitch.

62
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,143
This isn't too much trouble.

63
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,770
Just one more body
to burn, really.

64
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:40,066
[screeching]

65
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,738
It seems to be attracted
to your flames, Kusakabe.

66
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,618
I see. It must be trying
to go back to them.

67
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,913
Well, look at that!
It's my lucky day!

68
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,541
To think you were
here all this time.

69
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:01,171
The third person the
Evangelist is searching for.

70
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,672
[laughs]

71
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,091
[REKKA]
You have the undefiled flame.

72
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,385
The Adolla Burst!

73
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,512
What's an Adolla Burst?

74
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,224
[REKKA] It's what we who
serve under the Evangelist

75
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,559
have been seeking.

76
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,353
Something which can
only be possessed

77
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,356
by the offspring
of the great Sol.

78
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,275
The sacred flame
to lead mankind!

79
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,163
[REKKA] It is pure.
It is unadulterated fire.

80
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,249
I've lit Pilot Lights in
children for a long time,

81
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,585
hoping I would find
someone compatible,

82
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,505
and now that
someone's right here.

83
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,882
You put those bugs into kids.

84
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,597
Exactly how many people
have you turned into Infernals?

85
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,474
Why would I bother counting?

86
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,520
Such minor sacrifices are
nothing in the face of our goal.

87
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,233
I'm finished listening to you!

88
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,277
[SHINRA] If you think you
can get away with this,

89
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,696
you're wrong!

90
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,324
[TAMAKI gasps]

91
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,496
What are you doing
there, you sicko?

92
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,206
Uh. Sorry!

93
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,332
[SHINRA clears throat]

94
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,376
Okay. Cool. Let's do this.

95
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,628
Could you give back
my skirt first?

96
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,170
Huh?

97
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,214
Star Fist Jab!

98
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:33,054
Your flames are bright,
but they're not as hot as mine!

99
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,931
[TAMAKI screams]

100
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,307
Tamaki!

101
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,064
[REKKA]
My stars!

102
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,776
[smooch]

103
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,279
[TAMAKI whimpers]

104
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,863
[SHINRA]
Hm?

105
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,700
Sorry! It's not like that!
I got punched into you, okay?

106
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,204
[TAMAKI] Enough already.
Just fight him, will you?

107
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,040
Uh. Right.

108
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,880
[TAMAKI]
Please. Defeat him.

109
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,883
You can't let
Lieutenant Rekka win.

110
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,684
[SHINRA] Don't worry.
The hero always wins.

111
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,102
[REKKA]
Hmph.

112
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,032
[SHINRA] My firepower's either
as strong as Rekka's

113
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,117
or just a little bit weaker,

114
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,827
but that won't matter.

115
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,204
'Cause with my feet,

116
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,665
I have him beat hard
in terms of mobility.

117
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,001
And with all these
surfaces to jump on,

118
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,088
this building's the
perfect place to use it.

119
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,798
Here goes nothing.

120
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,637
[REKKA]
My stars!

121
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,224
The heat of my passionate
arms will burn all away.

122
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,059
Come at me, bro!

123
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,521
Don't let him beat you!

124
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,068
He's packing some real heat.

125
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,238
I barely touched him
and he burnt my knee.

126
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,614
[REKKA chuckles]

127
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,157
Too easy.

128
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,586
[growls] Star Fist Jab!

129
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,296
[yells]

130
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,674
Looks like ya missed me!

131
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,300
What's the matter?

132
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,386
You only know how to
fight at ground level,

133
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,763
but I can attack from anywhere!

134
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,892
[gasps]

135
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,982
[REKKA]
My stars.

136
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,984
[SHINRA yells]

137
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,527
[REKKA screams]

138
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:20,096
[CHILDREN crying]

139
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,890
Get behind the pillars, kids.

140
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,434
Sorry, but we don't know
for sure if it's safe yet.

141
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,936
Don't worry, I'm heading
towards you right now!

142
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,898
C'mon, Tak‐kun!

143
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:39,240
[REKKA gasping, choking]

144
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,209
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

145
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,127
[SHINRA] Yeah, but I
flew all the way here,

146
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,296
and then started
fighting right off.

147
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,173
I feel kinda lightheaded.

148
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,383
I think I used too much fire.

149
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,302
Sounds like you overheated.

150
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,554
Your flames use the oxygen
in your body as fuel,

151
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,890
and you've burned
through your reserves.

152
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,896
[REKKA growls]

153
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,992
You're finished,
Rekka Hoshimiya.

154
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,119
Just give yourself up.

155
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,372
I finally found a kid

156
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,832
who can serve as the
Pilot Light's host.

157
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,961
For the Evangelist's sake,
I can't let him go!

158
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,965
[screams]

159
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,595
Why have you been turning
children into Infernals?

160
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,847
How many accomplices
do you have?

161
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,142
And who's this
so‐called "Evangelist"?

162
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,561
We will seek out
compatible children

163
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,690
and create strong
new pyrokinetics.

164
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,441
We'll produce
countless Infernals

165
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,568
and return mankind to flame!

166
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,614
All is in accordance with
the will of the Evangelist!

167
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,993
What the hell are you after?

168
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,538
[REKKA] Behold the radiance
of the blazing star

169
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,498
ensconced in the heavens!

170
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,500
What greater end could we seek

171
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,961
than a return to
Sol's warm embrace?!

172
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,213
We will set all
human beings alight.

173
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,216
Engulf the earth in the
great flame of fire!

174
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,052
Let its imperfections
be burned away

175
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,596
by the flames of salvation!

176
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,976
We will turn this world
into a second sun!

177
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,110
No way. This is
all because you‐‐

178
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,612
Want this world
to be a new star!

179
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,115
Follow me. We're gonna
get out of here, okay?

180
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,409
[laughs]

181
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,202
I don't think so, kids!

182
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,955
I just wanted it to look
like you burned to death.

183
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,874
I wanted to take you
away to receive

184
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,043
the Evangelist's teachings!

185
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,840
Wait a sec... You take
kids from fires.

186
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,301
[growls, screams]

187
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,594
But in that case...

188
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,429
...you guys could've
taken my brother!

189
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,807
Burn, my Star Fists!
Burn with all my zeal!

190
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,144
Burn! Burn!

191
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,564
Stop that! You'll be consumed
by your own flames!

192
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,858
That's true, but I won't
be burned alone!

193
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,861
I'll reduce every last
person here to ash!

194
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,780
<i>Látom</i>!

195
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,745
[gasps] What the hell?

196
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,205
[KARIM]
Don't you remember?

197
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,291
You said you trusted me to watch
your back, so I did, Rekka.

198
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,044
[REKKA]
Karim! Don't interfere in this!

199
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,923
Stop that. You're not
gonna overpower my power.

200
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,674
You'll just make me
freeze you more.

201
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,343
That's what you think!

202
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,221
I'm about to vaporize
this dumb ice!

203
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:55,353
Fire!

204
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,696
I still can't believe
it was you.

205
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,909
I wasn't watching your back
so you could kill kids.

206
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,371
I came as soon as
I heard the report.

207
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,665
Karim, what's going on here?

208
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,917
I put Rekka on lockdown.

209
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,962
We can question, interrogate,
and grill him later.

210
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,340
What does this mean
for our company?

211
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,759
Spitting balls in a brainstorm.

212
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:30,471
I highly doubt this problem'll
be restricted to the First.

213
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,806
This is one of those
wide‐spread,

214
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:35,059
far‐reaching problems
that spreads far and wide.

215
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
What was that?

216
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,105
[gasps]

217
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,194
[SHINRA]
Rekka.

218
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,697
It looks like someone shot him.

219
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,497
[ARROW]
Direct hit.

220
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,125
Hoshimiya has been eliminated.

221
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,294
[MAN B] There are more
Fire Soldiers in there.

222
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,296
Thin their numbers.

223
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,550
[ARROW]
Acknowledged.

224
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,095
Again?!

225
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,305
It's a sniper!

226
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,348
Ya know where
they're shooting from?

227
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,892
[ARROW]
I missed.

228
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,437
[ARROW]
It won't happen again.

229
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,440
Karim!

230
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,524
[LI grunts]

231
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,449
Shinra! Put up a smokescreen!

232
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,575
Right!

233
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,703
Tamaki!

234
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,830
Stay with the children,
keep them out of sight.

235
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,915
[TAMAKI]
Yes, sir!

236
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:43,336
[SHINRA yelling]

237
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,214
You saved me. I'm sorry.

238
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,134
Company One's lost enough today,
and you're our shield.

239
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,512
We can't let you fall here.

240
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,139
What good is a shield that
needs to be shielded?

241
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,768
I need to get everybody out
of this building safely.

242
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,481
Shinra! Can you get
eyes on the enemy?

243
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,241
Two targets on the roof of
a building southwest of us!

244
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:13,991
'Kay.

245
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,826
On Shinra's signal,
project your fire

246
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,246
as far southwest as
you can, Tamaki!

247
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,248
And do a zig‐zag,
zag‐ziggy kinda thing

248
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,541
to hide your position!

249
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,750
Yes, sir!

250
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,505
[ARROW]
I've lost all visuals.

251
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,600
Karim, tell me, what's
the point of this?

252
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,727
We're demonstrating that
we know their position

253
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,979
while constructing a barrier

254
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,648
to further obstruct
their view of us.

255
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,275
More importantly,
we're doing something

256
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,568
that they won't understand,

257
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,863
which means they'll try to guess
and psyche themselves out.

258
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,659
After all, snipers do like
to work from safety.

259
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,790
[MAN A]
It seems they know our location.

260
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,960
[ARROW] I can't get a good shot
through all that smoke and ice.

261
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,795
We've silenced Hoshimiya.

262
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,465
If we fight any more, we'll just
expose ourselves to danger.

263
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,633
Let's withdraw.

264
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,219
We should tell the
commander what happened.

265
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,932
Hey, looks like the
targets are on the move!

266
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,559
Should I go after them?

267
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,060
You're still overheated
from fighting

268
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,938
that fight against Rekka,
so you'd just get killed.

269
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,981
All we can do right now

270
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,817
is hunker down in our shell
like frightened turtles.

271
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,777
If we let them run
with the wrong idea,

272
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,780
then I'm sure they'll
run away from us.

273
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,866
They made a hell of a mess here.

274
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,994
All I could see of them
is that they wore white.

275
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,497
[SHINRA] There's a group that's
turning civilians Infernal

276
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,709
and setting fire to the
scenes of their crimes.

277
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,338
Among them are the kidnapped
children they gave powers.

278
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,840
One might be my brother.

279
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:57,053
At least I know who to go
after now: The Evangelist.

280
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,223
Well, Tamaki, are these all
the kids you brought here?

281
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,475
[TAMAKI]
Yes, sir.

282
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,274
Put this on.

283
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,027
[TAMAKI] Oh, thanks,
but I‐I couldn't possibly.

284
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,237
It's fine; just put it on.

285
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,871
[TAMAKI]
I appreciate it, sir.

286
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,874
Sorry, Tamaki.

287
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,878
But even though Rekka lied to
you, you need to be prepared.

288
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,715
I know. I lured these
children into danger.

289
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,468
I'll accept any
punishment I receive.

290
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:50,481
I appreciate your
helping us stop him.

291
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,984
Did he start out hot‐blooded
and become a son of a bitch?

292
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,656
Or was he a son of a bitch who
ended up becoming hot‐blooded?

293
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,159
I dunno. Rekka was
just Rekka to me.

294
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,246
It's hard to imagine
him keeping a secret.

295
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,373
Or hiding what he felt.

296
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,335
Company Eight's investigating

297
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,379
the other special
companies, right?

298
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,840
I bet you're after
the Evangelist, too.

299
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,551
I want him caught just
as much as you guys do.

300
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,553
Let's catch him together.

301
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,933
That sounds good to me.

302
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,823
[SHINRA]
Our training has been cancelled.

303
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,242
The First has a lot
of reports to write.

304
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,786
And a need to
re‐examine its past.

305
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,496
Rekka was killed.

306
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,290
Arthur ended up getting
lost while chasing him.

307
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,544
We had to file a missing
person's report.

308
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,420
[chuckles]

309
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,965
[SHINRA] I didn't realize how
much I missed the Eighth.

310
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,261
I wasn't gone long, but this
still feels like a homecoming.

311
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,138
The captain's
constant workouts...

312
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,058
The lieutenant's weird hats...

313
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,978
The mostly cool and
beautiful Maki...

314
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,982
[IRIS]
Here. I made you a cup of tea.

315
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,694
Excellent work, Shinra.
You've done our company proud.

316
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,196
Thanks a bunch, Sister.

317
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,615
[SHINRA]
The Sister's angelic smile...

318
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,746
[SHINRA] I only joined the
Eighth a little while ago,

319
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,124
but there's something about it.

320
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,085
I already feel so relaxed here.

321
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,254
Huh?!

322
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:00,713
[TAMAKI]
Hm?

323
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,131
Wha‐‐?! No way!

324
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,133
What are you doing
here, cat girl?

325
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,259
[TAMAKI]
Meow.

326
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,846
Tamaki here has been put on
suspension at the First for now,

327
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,974
on account of her role in
the Hoshimiya incident.

328
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,351
We'll be takin' her
in while that lasts.

329
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,604
I figure that with the
two of you together,

330
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,647
you'll have an easier time
writing your reports

331
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,690
on the incident.

332
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,318
Oh. I see, sir.

333
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,360
Huh?

334
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,406
Okay. Well, that being
the case, Tamaki...

335
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,992
Would you mind letting me
have your phone number?

336
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,410
What?!

337
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,746
Wait, why are you pretending
you'll need my number for work?

338
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,457
We're gonna be in the
same office all day.

339
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,959
Though, I guess...

340
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,420
...exchanging phone numbers
isn't the worst idea.

341
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,839
So you'll do it?
Well, that's a relief.

342
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,257
Juggernaut's really
been bugging me

343
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,468
to help him get it from you.

344
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,553
No way! And don't ask again!

345
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,473
[screaming]

346
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,727
[SHINRA] Another aggressor
had invaded my safe haven,

347
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,730
and just as I'd gotten
rid of Arthur, too.

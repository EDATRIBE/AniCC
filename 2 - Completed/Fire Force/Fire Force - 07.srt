[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,235
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

3
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,028
But out of that long,
morbid list,

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,615
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

5
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:25,752
Seems the Eighth and the Fifth
had a joint training session.

6
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,754
Quite the cover story.

7
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,718
It sounds like Obi's
finally making his move.

To grill is to pit one's skill

Well, first of all,
we're glad to have you here

15
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,001
for our "job well done" party.

16
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,838
The Nighttime Joint Exercise
was a big success,

17
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,506
so thank you.

18
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,174
Uh, when I spoke to Captain‐‐

00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,137
or I guess it's Princess
Hibana, there‐‐ Whatever.

20

Self‐satisfied punk.

without my permission!

24
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,274
Right, Shinra?

25
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,358
Owie.

26
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,027
[OBI] Uh... we do
appreciate you taking on

27
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,655
a smaller company like ours.

28
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,200
[HINAWA]
Enjoy.

29
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,494
Yeah. Sure.

Begone! You damn Will‐o‐Wisps!

Hey, what are you
doing that for?

00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,927
The lieutenant said if you
tried to play with fire,

41
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,804
my duty would be
to snuff it out.

[OBI groans]

46
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,782
[OBI]
Just to be sure,

47
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,493
are you saying we have the
full cooperation of the Fifth?

48
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,660
[HIBANA]
Not the whole Company's,

49
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,621
but I'll cooperate personally.

50
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,122
As I'm sure you realize,

51
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,500
the Fifth is aligned with
Haijima Industries.

52
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,169
As things stand, Company
Eight would be hard‐pressed

53
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,047
to confront that
corporation directly.

54
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,840
You planned to start
by destroying the Fifth

55
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,636
and exposing our
research, correct?

56
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,679
[OBI]
Yeah.

57
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,766
How did you come by your
intel on the Fifth anyway?

58
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,811
Were Iris' actions
a part of your plan?

59
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,313
That was all her, I promise.

60
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:17,067
That said, I did figure she'd be
an ace up my sleeve with you.

61
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,236
[grumbles]

62
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,112
[HIBANA] You answered
one question vaguely

63
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,948
and ignored the other.

64
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,492
Well, I doubt a meathead
ape like yourself

65
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,119
could understand
the Fifth's research.

66
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,996
You should be grateful
to have my help,

67
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,499
'cause you're certainly
going to need it.

68
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,295
[OBI]
Why the sudden change of heart?

69
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,672
[HIBANA]
I once went through something

70
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,967
that turned my faith
in flame to despair.

71
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,761
The more I learned of
this country, this world,

72
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,180
the deeper that
despair took root.

73
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,182
I told myself that
my growing cynicism

74
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,059
was making me stronger.

75
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,811
Smarter.

76
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,814
I thought that to face
this crummy world,

77
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,568
my only hope was to
fight evil with evil.

78
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,697
Then, when a self‐proclaimed
hero named Shinra beat me,

79
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,490
I remembered...

80
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,787
Justice can be gentle.
Flame can keep you warm.

81
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,623
He showed me that it's possible
to stand against evil

82
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,877
without allowing it
to taint who you are.

83
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,670
[OBI]
From the way you talk about him,

84
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,797
it almost sounds like
he's your hero.

85
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,384
[HIBANA]
Ew. No. It's nothing so trite.

86
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,679
No shame in admiring a
hero's courage, Princess.

87
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,056
Honestly, I think his
light'll guide us

88
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,642
out of this dark
prison of flame.

89
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,730
[HIBANA] So your mission is to
investigate the other companies

90
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,357
in order to solve the
mystery of the flames.

91
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,861
[OBI] Yeah. That's why we
came to steal your research.

92
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,614
I heard that you made
quite the discovery.

93
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,993
Something related to the
cause of human combustion.

94
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,037
Did I hear right?

95
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:57,542
Yeah. And it may help you
to see why I turned devil.

96
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,588
Someone out there is
deliberately creating Infernals.

97
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,757
That said, I'm not
suggesting every

98
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,052
spontaneous human
combustion case is murder,

99
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,678
but certain samples I studied

100
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,555
were very different
from the others.

101
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,390
I can explain in detail later.

102
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,934
[OBI] I can't believe
someone out there

103
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,144
is sick enough to do that.

104
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,438
Well, they won't
get away with it.

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,191
I will hunt them down.

106
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:26,112
[HIBANA] The nuns, my friends,
all burned to death.

107
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,741
If a human being was
responsible for their pain...

108
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,661
...then I swear by
St. John's wort

109
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,829
and the malice it symbolizes,

110
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,541
I'll do whatever it takes to
find them and burn them alive.

111
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,005
[OBI] Sounds like we're
both after the same mark.

112
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,175
[HIBANA]
Hpmh. I guess that's true.

113
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:51,221
Of course, this investigation of
yours will only get harder now.

114
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,931
Yeah? How do you mean?

115
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,724
[HIBANA]
The suspected manmade Infernals

116
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,601
all have something in common.

117
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,646
They were first sighted
near Shinjuku Ward.

118
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,274
But that's...
Company One's turf.

119
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,790
Pardon, Sister, but what are
you doing here at the Eighth?

120
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,916
[HIBANA]
Hmm?

121
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,167
[gasps]

122
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,212
I mostly came by to make sure
you've been maturing properly.

123
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,381
Hey! Stop it.
That's a dirty move.

124
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,924
That's rather rude.

125
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,093
I'll have you know I'm
quite clean right now.

126
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,554
You know that's not
what I meant, Sister!

127
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,639
[MAKI] It must be nice
for the two of you,

128
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,517
having such soft,
feminine figures.

129
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,476
Oh, come on.

130
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,978
I say those hard‐earned muscles

131
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,938
are beautiful in
their own right.

132
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,189
D'ya mean it?

133
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,483
That's kinda nice to hear.

134
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:52,490
Sister, you're planning
something dangerous, right?

135
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,616
Yes.

136
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,495
I'm working with your captain
to investigate Company One.

137
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,081
There's a chance
it leads to war.

138
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,295
[HIBANA] A surreptitious
investigation of the First

139
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,756
using the rookie training
reassignment system?

140
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,051
Not bad, Obi. That might work.

141
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,887
Yeah, "The rookie training
reassignment system

142
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,223
enables first‐year crew members
to broaden their experience

143
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,643
by getting temporarily assigned
to different companies."

144
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,729
I'm gonna use this to
send the two of you

145
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,689
to Company One as spies.

146
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,317
So we're going to
the First undercover?

147
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,693
Just me and Arthur?

148
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,155
Somebody in their jurisdiction‐‐
perhaps in their company‐‐

149
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,991
has potentially been turning
human beings into Infernals

150
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,493
through artificial means.

151
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,787
Try to come up with
any leads you can.

152
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,789
This could be the key
to cracking the mystery

153
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,833
of human combustion,
so be careful.

154
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,168
Best of luck.

155
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,586
I'm on it, Captain.

156
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,881
If someone really is causing
human combustion, they'll pay.

157
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,466
They may begin to
suspect something

158
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,718
if they're only assigned
recruits from the Eighth.

159
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,054
I'll send one of
my soldiers, too.

160
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,973
And I'll have a word with
some other companies.

161
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,070
So this is the Holy
Sol Obelisk, huh?

162
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,155
Think it's even taller
than I'd imagined.

163
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,241
I bet I could climb it.

164
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,538
Pretty lame if you ask me.

165
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,873
Company One's Grand
Cathedral is so sacred.

166
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,708
I don't feel like I'm worthy.

167
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,043
Who're these guys?

168
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,586
They're camouflage, okay?

169
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,880
You should try to
make nice with them.

170
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,927
Thank you for your help.

171
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,428
[BOTH]
Uh.

172
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:48,648
[SHINRA]
Hm?

173
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,526
So you're the newbie‐in‐
training rookie noobs.

174
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,571
Sheesh. I bet even
your crap is crap.

175
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,698
Are you crappy? You crap?

176
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,907
[growls]

177
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,159
Huh?

178
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,245
[KARIM]
"I bet even your crap is crap.

179
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,414
Are you crappy? You crap?"

180
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,169
[SHINRA] I feel like he's
trying to insult us,

181
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,922
but it sounds like he's
just talkin' about crap.

182
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,758
You bet your ass I know
an ass when I see one.

183
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,386
And your ass is an
ass like any other.

184
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,387
Get me?

185
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,555
What did you say?!

186
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,389
Calm down.

187
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,058
He's basically just telling
you that your ass is an ass.

188
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,102
Huh?

189
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,604
[ARTHUR grunts]

190
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,942
[KARIM] Captain Burns
is expecting you all.

191
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,319
Come with me.

192
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,282
[SHINRA]
Company One's Captain Burns.

193
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,868
He was at the fire,
12 years ago.

194
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,914
[SHINRA]
He knows something.

195
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,541
He'll be waiting
before the altar.

196
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,836
[SHINRA] If someone caused it
on purpose, I need to know.

197
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,597
Company One welcomes you.

198
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,767
I'm glad you recruits
could join us.

199
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,394
[SHINRA]
And I'm one step closer.

200
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,239
It's bad form, wearing those
uniforms in a Church.

201
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,783
Cut 'em some slack.
They didn't know.

202
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,619
I am Maki Oze!
First Class Fire Soldier.

203
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,788
Here from Company Eight.

204
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,040
I've brought the new
recruits in for training!

205
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,250
We're speaking as soldiers,

206
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,335
but we're still in
the Grand Cathedral.

207
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,795
Forgive me for asking,

208
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,965
but I would prefer for you to
tent hands rather than salute.

209
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,258
[gasps]

210
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,178
Of course, sir. My apologies.

211
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,765
I'll introduce
Lieutenant Karim Flam,

212
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,936
Lieutenant Rekka Hoshimiya,
and Lieutenant Huo Yan Li.

213
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,606
They'll be looking after you for
the duration of your training.

214
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,901
You're free to look
around the premises.

215
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,195
We want you to feel
at home here.

216
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,823
'Scuse me, Captain Burns,
I know this is sudden...

217
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,032
[BURNS]
Hm?

218
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,535
[SHINRA]
But I thought I'd ask.

219
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,912
To give you a chance to
assess our abilities,

220
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,957
why don't we start our training
with a quick sparring match?

221
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,918
[MAKI] Wait, Shinra.
Did you really just say that?

222
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,628
We read about all your abilities

223
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,338
in the paperwork
that came with you,

224
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,132
so there's no need for that.

225
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,508
That's all right.

226
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,177
Rekka, help me give
all of 'em a workout.

227
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,471
Huh? Do you mean it?

228
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,349
Calm down. We're in
the Grand Cathedral.

229
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,434
Ahem. Right.

230
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,685
[MAKI] What do you think
you're doing, Shinra?

231
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,936
[KISHIRI]
This is so lame.

232
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,147
[SHINRA]
Throwing a light jab.

233
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,690
If I manage to beat you,

234
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,526
there's something I'd
like to ask you about.

235
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,404
That's fine by me.

236
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,498
[OBI groans]

237
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,834
[OBI]
Hope those kids are okay.

238
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,421
There's nothing more
you can do to help them,

239
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,465
so there's no point worrying.

240
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,966
Well, be that as it may,

241
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,761
worrying is still a
captain's prerogative.

242
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,721
I can't work like this.

243
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,432
Hey, stop complaining.
Just get back to it.

244
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,518
[HINAWA] Why don't you "get
back" to your post at the Fifth?

245
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,562
[giggles]

246
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,731
[HIBANA] I hope Shinra doesn't
get too full of himself

247
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,316
because he beat me.

248
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,778
That Captain Burns is
a seasoned veteran.

249
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,237
Shinra!

250
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,989
You just got here and
you're already sparring

251
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,283
with Captain Burns?!

252
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,242
It isn't fair!

253
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,245
The captain hasn't even
sparred with me before!

254
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,126
[TAMAKI] If that twerp
hurts Lieutenant Rekka,

255
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,420
I'll cave his cocky face in!

256
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,925
[SHINRA]
I'm gonna do this, damn it!

257
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,844
I'll make him spill
everything he knows!

258
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,137
Is your friend all right?

259
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,640
He seems to be a
little aggravated.

260
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,809
I think he's just so
delighted to be at the First

261
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,394
that he can't contain himself.

262
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,437
Then he's a
high‐spirited crewman!

263
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,273
Sweet! I'm getting all fired up!

264
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,567
[chuckles]

265
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,486
So which of us should go first?

266
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,946
How 'bout we start
with the recruit

267
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,781
from the lowest‐numbered
company?

268
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,533
There's no need to hold back.

269
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,744
I want you to put your
full power on display.

270
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,330
[TAKERU]
The lowest‐numbered company...

271
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,587
[TAKERU]
Huh?! I have to go first?

272
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,179
[chuckles] Hey, I'm
Lieutenant Hoshimiya.

273
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,057
Seems the two of
us'll be sparring.

274
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,893
[TAKERU] I'm Second Class
Fire Soldier Takeru Noto.

275
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,770
My family owns a <i>jahgaimo</i> farm,

276
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,148
so I started getting
called "Jaga Noto."

277
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,733
And then that turned
into "Juggernaut."

278
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,194
I'm looking forward to
a heated match, okay?

279
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,072
[TAKERU]
No. No fire, please!

280
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,241
Ya think this guy's okay?

281
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,953
[TAKERU]
Oh, no. This is just awful.

282
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,788
Now there's fire coming from me!

283
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,541
Somebody put it out! Please!

284
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,376
That's what I like
to see, buddy!

285
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,670
Those flames symbolize
your burning passion!

286
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,255
[TAKERU]
That is not what this is!

287
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,923
I'm just scared! Really scared!

288
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,176
Ah! It's so hot!

289
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,303
You and I like it
hot, Juggernaut.

290
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:14,307
Keep on pushin'. Lemme see
the best flames you've got!

291
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,601
[BURNS] That enthusiasm's
always set to broil.

292
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,394
[LI]
Yeah. I'm a little worried.

293
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,271
[KARIM]
I'll deal with any stray shots.

294
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,606
[LI]
See that you do.

295
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,773
Good grief.

296
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,277
This nuisance really is an
annoying thorn in my side.

297
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,361
I'm simmering!

298
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,988
Oh, man, the Special Fire Force

299
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,115
has been waiting for talent
like yours, ya know?

300
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,450
[TAKERU]
Don't talk like that!

301
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,202
You're gonna get me stirred up.

302
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,495
I'm scared of fire!

303
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,787
I joined the Special Fire Force

304
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,457
because I wanted to get
my flames put out!

305
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,959
But you guys just
keep fanning them!

306
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,961
The heat you're puttin'
out is incredible!

307
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,840
Every last shot has the
force of a juggernaut!

308
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,467
Lieutenant Rekka!

309
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,427
[REKKA]
Nice one! Keep it up!

310
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,261
[laughs]

311
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,763
[growls]

312
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,972
[REKKA yells]

313
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,767
Ya dodged 'em all,
ya lazy slacker sloth.

314
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,518
It's all good,

315
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,978
'cause I've got you
backin' me up, Karim!

316
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:05,441
What the‐‐?

317
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,193
He stopped them.

318
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,490
But that much energy can't
have just been erased.

319
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,043
So he froze all that flame?

320
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,381
Damn it, Rekka!

321
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,007
That might'a burned
the Captain's uniform

322
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,551
if I hadn't been here!

323
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,971
[REKKA] But you were here!
And I totally believe in you!

324
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,979
Does the First really
have a Fire Soldier

325
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,189
who conjures frost
instead of flame?

326
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,190
[KARIM]
Hm?

327
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,359
I'm just a regular
second‐generation.

328
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,070
You really think I have
some kinda frost powers?

329
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,197
Then where'd that ice come from?

330
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,575
It's called Thermo‐
Acoustic Cooling.

331
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,784
It's a technique that allows me

332
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,245
to convert the heat energy
of flame into sound

333
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,623
by compressing it
in a specific way.

334
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,294
As that sound abrades the air,
it's converted into cold.

335
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,087
So you can take a fire's heat

336
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,631
and convert it into
sound to freeze it over?

337
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,301
I didn't even realize
that was possible!

338
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,552
[ARTHUR]
Huh?

339
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,478
[SHINRA] Someone in
or near the First

340
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,732
is artificially turning
people Infernal.

341
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,985
The culprit could be
one of these guys.

342
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,238
Or it could be all three.

343
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,746
Let's start the next.

344
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,248
I only fight when I see
an essential purpose.

345
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,666
You'll have to excuse me.

346
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,001
Yeah, so, uh,

347
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,086
I can only do the stuff
on my paperwork,

348
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,922
which means you should know what
I can do without me fighting.

349
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,841
That okay?

350
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,885
That leaves Company Eight.

351
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,890
You two fight as a team.
I'll take on both o' ya.

352
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,144
Why would the Captain agree
to waste his time on them?

353
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,161
Bring it on.

354
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,500
Chivalry dictates that
we take turns,

355
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,419
and since I'm gonna beat
him, you won't get one.

356
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,837
Have at thee.

357
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,215
[ARTHUR yells]

358
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,138
What are you planning
to do with that hand?

359
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,103
Fight me with all you have.

360
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,689
If you don't, this match
will be completely devoid

361
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,816
of any meaning.

362
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,443
Fine, but don't blame
me if you lose an arm.

363
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,947
You would need to wield a hotter
flame than that one to cut me.

364
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,740
Set your mind at ease.

365
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,784
"A hotter flame than that"?

366
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,744
What's hotter than
Arthur's Excalibur?

367
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,956
He can even use that blade
to cut through steel.

368
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,211
[ARTHUR]
At least I warned you!

369
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,421
[gasps]

370
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,344
Your sword kills
with one strike,

371
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,430
but what if it should fail you?

372
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:33,315
No way. Not even the ogress
could extinguish Excalibur.

373
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,986
What are you waiting for?
Don't ease up on him now!

374
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,411
That crewman packs some
impressive firepower, too.

375
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,842
Step back or you'll be killed.

376
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,061
Unreal.

377
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:16,275
A question for you:
Why join the Fire Force?

378
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,986
I lost both my mom and
my brother in a fire.

379
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,864
I joined the Force to solve the
mystery of human combustion

380
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,366
and make fires like that
a thing of the past.

381
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,660
To become a hero who
can save the world

382
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,205
from the terror of the flames!

383
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,957
You still have a long way to go.

384
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,764
Let me bid each of you
welcome to Company One.

385
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,849
You'll be here but
for a short time.

386
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,519
I suggest you work hard
and make the most of it.

387
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,270
Are you hurt, Captain?

388
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,897
That was amazing!

389
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:55,481
[TAMAKI grunts]

390
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,942
[screams]

391
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,360
[TAMAKI]
Ah?!

392
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,111
[TAMAKI]
Ah...

393
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,738
Gotcha.

394
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,116
Your Lucky Lecher Lure is
no match for my reflexes.

395
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,326
We're good.

396
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,787
Thank you, Lieutenant Rekka.

397
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,957
I'm so sorry! You
always have to help me!

398
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,127
[footsteps]

399
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,839
You Company Eight
guys'll train under me.

400
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,591
You two never had a chance
against Captain Burns.

401
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,427
But you still did all right,
in a fairly decent way.

402
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,554
Of course we did.

403
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,472
Thank you for saying so, sir.

404
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,891
But whether your pace keeps
you apace of our pace,

405
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,811
or whether your pace gets
outpaced by our pace,

406
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,856
just try to hang in there, okay?

407
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,484
Thank you very much, sir!

408
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,694
[ARTHUR]
Huh?

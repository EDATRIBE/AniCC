1
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,444
You are aware of what's
going on in the world?

2
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,322
The chaos that consumes it?

3
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,658
The planet is in shambles.

4
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,536
Space distorts in areas
where the flames rise,

5
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,287
carving up continents.

6
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,539
Maps are being redrawn,

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,959
and many countries that
once existed have fallen.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,044
These days, there are few places

9
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,796
where you can live
a decent life‐‐

10
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,965
other than the Tokyo Empire.

11
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:52,594
And so, people gather here in
the relatively undamaged Tokyo,

12
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:53,929
where the Holy Sol Temple

13
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,307
and Haijima Industries have
developed Amaterasu,

14
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,935
the perpetual thermal
energy plant.

15
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,188
The empire is the beneficiary
of its vast energy,

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,024
and has made further
advancements of its own.

17
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,486
Can we get down to it,
or does this story keep going?

18
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,280
[MAN B]
Eh. Who can say?

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:15,409
Personally, I would very much
like for it to continue.

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,160
So how'd it go?

21
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,288
Used the stuff I had
you make for me.

22
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,082
The results were more
than satisfactory.

23
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,333
I did a little digging

24
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,961
into Special Fire Force
Company Eight.

25
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,714
I found out something
interesting.

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,340
Their captain, Akitaru Obi,

27
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,135
was decorated twice
in his firefighter days.

28
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,513
He was later stripped
of both medals.

29
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,974
Both times it was
because he defied orders

30
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,476
and put human lives first.

31
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,020
Oh, did he, now?

32
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,021
For better or worse,

33
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,982
seems the captain was
a model firefighter.

34
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,817
He's the cornerstone.

35
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,861
Company Eight was built
around that man's

36
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,488
magnetism and strength
of character.

37
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,617
They're a different breed
than the other companies.

38
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,577
It's fascinating.

39
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,473
Yeah! The Rookie Games are here!

40
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,016
[TAMAKI]
Tamaki Kotatsu.

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,893
Ready to kick some butt!

42
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,862
Huh? Wanna tell me what
you're starin' at, loser?

43
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,739
Nothing.

44
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,948
[MAKI gasps]

45
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,908
Wone Wone Nyine!

46
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,243
[SHINRA]
"Wone Wone" what?

47
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,244
[MAKI]
You don't know them?

48
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,455
They're the Fire Defense
Agency's mascots.

49
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,331
Wone Wone Nyine!

50
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,042
These are our mascots?
Even the old dude?

51
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,795
Oh. His name is Mamoru.

52
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,547
[SHINRA]
Whatever you say.

53
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,883
[MAKI] Initially the characters
were two dogs and a cat,

54
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,092
but for whatever reason,

55
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,719
the higher‐ups at
the Agency complained

56
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,345
about all of them being animals.

57
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,930
So they switched
things up a little

58
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,265
and made one of them an old man

59
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,976
who kinda looks like
a dog instead.

60
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,687
If you ask me, they'd be
better off with the two dogs.

61
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,024
Huh? But Mamoru is adorable!

62
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,108
Him?

63
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,527
[MAKI]
Mh‐hm. Mh‐hm.

64
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,779
Him?

65
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,864
[MAKI]
Mh‐hm. Mh‐hm.

66
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,550
[gasps]

67
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,682
No, it can't be.

68
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,563
Excuse me!

69
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,898
[BURNS]
Hm?

70
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,067
Uh.

71
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,444
Can I help you with something?

72
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,072
You one of the new recruits
here for the games?

73
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:22,948
Yes!

74
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:27,577
Fire Force Company Eight,
sir. Shinra Kusakabe.

75
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,330
Sorry. Mind if I ask
some questions?

76
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,666
It's about that
fire 12 years ago.

77
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,085
I'm afraid I haven't got
time to chat right now.

78
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,378
Good luck.

79
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,671
I just need a sec‐‐

80
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,380
Watch it!

81
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,881
Who exactly do you
think you are,

82
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,092
talking to my captain
like that, you jerk?

83
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,636
[yelps, whimpers]

84
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,598
Uh, my bad. I'm sorry.

85
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,142
Hey! What are you
smiling at creep?!

86
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,353
[TAMAKI gasps]

87
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:55,939
[TAMAKI squeals]

88
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,065
It's not fair!

89
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,109
Why does my lucky lecher
lure always flare up

90
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,986
at the worst possible moment?

91
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,737
If your objective
was to distract me,

92
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,282
then you succeeded in a big way.

93
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,705
This won't take long, Captain.

94
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,456
Can I just have a moment?

95
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,208
[ANNOUNCER A] The competition
is about to begin.

96
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,252
All competitors, please
put on your turnout gear

97
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,171
and gather in the
designated area.

98
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,632
I believe you said
your name was Shinra?

99
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,175
Do you have the slightest idea

100
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,761
how many fires break out
in any given year?

101
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,264
Sorry to disappoint,
but you can't expect me

102
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,058
to remember one
from 12 years ago.

103
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,062
The competition is beginning.
Go and get ready.

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,652
[SHINRA]
He's hiding something.

105
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,238
What is this?

106
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,615
[MAKI gasps]

107
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,035
[CREWMAN A]
Inside this building,

108
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,245
you'll find a
simulated fire scene.

109
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,247
Your objectives are as follows:

110
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,876
Overcome the obstacles within,
rescue any who require it,

111
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,753
and be the first one
to reach the crewman

112
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,922
who's posing as an Infernal.

113
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,427
So that's it.
We storm the castle.

114
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,095
Ready, rookies?

115
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,307
Begin!

116
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,482
[TAMAKI]
He that cocky?

117
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,943
[SHINRA] Too bad for
the rest of these clowns.

118
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,363
I can fly my way
straight to the top.

119
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,197
[TAMAKI yells]

120
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:31,368
He's playing dirty.
This is why I hate devils.

121
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,911
[TAMAKI]
Damn it!

122
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,704
Nekomata!

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,379
Appearing from the sky
is the mark of a true hero.

124
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,176
[SHINRA]
Well, here we go.

125
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,637
I've got more questions
for that captain.

126
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,515
I need to wrap this up and fast.

127
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:01,272
Hello? Are there any
survivors up here?

128
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,831
Hey there.

129
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,458
I took the liberty of
ensuring our conversation

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,002
wouldn't be interrupted.

131
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,837
I need your full attention.

132
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,548
Ya got that, Devil Foot?

133
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,258
Uh...

134
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:32,512
I have some info about the fire
that happened 12 years ago.

135
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,639
Would you like to hear it?

136
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,349
You what?

137
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,435
[MAN A chuckles]

138
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:42,022
[SHINRA]
How? Who the hell are you?

139
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,940
You are curious, right?

00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,775
About the fire that
claimed the lives

of your mommy and
sweet baby brother?

142
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:54,159
About the day that you,
yourself, became a devil.

143
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,119
Wait, how do you
know about that?

144
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,163
The fire... and my family?

145
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,789
[thud]

146
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,541
[SHINRA]
Get away from those crewmen!

147
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,668
[MAN A]
Huh? Really?

148
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,503
You're more worried
about these two

149
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,922
than the mysteries of your past?

150
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,176
You Fire Soldiers...

151
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,469
I'll tell you what.

152
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,972
If these men are making
it hard for you to focus...

153
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,771
...then I guess
I'll have to kill them.

154
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,606
Don't you dare!

155
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,861
[chuckles]

156
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,952
Now, what do you know
about the fire? Tell me!

157
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,245
Oh, I'll tell you,

158
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,916
but only if you manage
to entertain me first.

159
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:48,379
Time to play. Let's see how
many moves you can last.

160
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,257
[SHINRA]
Ashes?

161
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,693
Huh?

162
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:35,051
Pity. That was
disappointingly easy.

163
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,432
[MAN A]
Guess I'll kill you.

164
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:46,938
[SHINRA]
He... He's gonna kill me.

165
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,899
Wow, that's a hell of
a face you're making.

166
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,403
You can smile even
at a time like this?

167
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,572
You're tougher than I thought.

168
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,657
You've earned a reward:

169
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,783
I'll tell you something about

170
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,870
what really happened
in that fire.

171
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,709
Here's hint number one:

172
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,503
Your little brother is alive.

173
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,050
My brother? Sho is still alive?

174
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,095
What are you saying?

175
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,723
They told me he burned
to death, bones and all.

176
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,518
Besides, if he is alive,
where has he been all this time?

177
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,480
He was a baby when it
happened‐‐only one year old!

178
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,274
It's starting to
sound like someone's

179
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,359
been hiding something,
doesn't it?

180
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,862
[SHINRA]
You expect me to believe that?

181
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,370
I saw that look.

182
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,749
What's the matter, kid,
you have someone in mind?

183
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,503
Even if that's really true,
how would you know about it?

184
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,381
And why would you go out
of your way to tell me?

185
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,344
What are you after?
Why did you come here?

186
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,304
I'm glad to see I've
finally secured

187
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,181
your undivided attention.

188
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,517
You show promise, and I'd
hate for it to go to waste.

189
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,810
From the way you're acting,

190
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,021
I'm guessing you've got
your own suspicions

191
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,565
about the noble Fire Force.

192
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,108
And who can blame you?

193
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,819
Your mother is dead.

194
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:21,282
You wanna know
the truth, don't you?

195
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,742
If you wanna know what happened,

196
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,369
you have to quit
playing the hero

197
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,289
with your Fire Soldier buddies
and come be a devil with me.

198
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,252
That's my choice, hero or devil?

199
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,419
Screw you!

200
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,588
I don't care who you
are or what you know,

201
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,174
you still assaulted
two Fire Soldiers.

202
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,386
So I'm gonna bring you in
after I kick your ass!

203
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,223
Well, you're no fun.
And I had such high hopes.

204
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,644
A flying kick? That
leaves you wide open.

205
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,230
[gasps]

206
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,573
A flying kick is the
mark of a true hero!

207
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,121
Now that was impressive.

208
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,624
Nice to see a devil's
firepower in action.

209
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,649
[TAMAKI]
Hmph.

210
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,698
[TAMAKI screams]

211
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,829
Ow! That's gonna leave a mark!

212
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,878
[TAMAKI] I'm sensing
something nasty up ahead.

213
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,589
Whatever it is,
it smells like danger.

214
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,883
[ARTHUR] I am not a
knight‐shaped seat cushion.

215
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,217
Kindly move.

216
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,677
[screams]

217
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,263
Hey! What were you doing
down there, sicko?!

218
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,433
I am not a knight‐shaped
punching bag, either.

219
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,069
Hey!

220
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,111
Watch out!

221
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,408
This dragged on too long‐‐
now we've got an audience.

222
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,869
"Infernal." Sorry to keep you.

223
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:30,953
Arthur!

224
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,997
A suspicious man has
infiltrated the games

225
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,832
and injured two crewmen.

226
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,043
Go report to the
captains outside!

227
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,586
Oh, yeah?

228
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,713
[chuckles]

229
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,591
Clearly you lie,
but I won't be duped.

230
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,634
What?

231
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,052
Victory is mine!

232
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,846
[yells] You stupid knight!

233
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,310
How's wavin' that sword
around like an idiot

234
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,354
gonna help you catch me?

235
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,483
Out of the way.
It's my turn now!

236
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,403
[yells]

237
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,657
Ha! Gotcha!

238
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,699
Hm?

239
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,665
This kinda seems like overkill
for the Rookie Games.

240
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:19,043
Like I told you before:
He's not part of the games.

241
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,967
Okay, Shinra, if you're really
that determined to be a hero,

242
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,135
then let's see if you can get

243
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,679
every person out of
this building alive.

244
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,306
[SHINRA]
Hm? More of that stuff?

245
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,769
What's that?

246
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,187
Ashes?

247
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,732
Well, catch ya later, Devil.

248
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,360
Remember, if you ever wanna
team up with the Joker,

249
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,029
I'll be happy to take you in.

250
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,119
[JOKER]
Good luck.

251
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,620
We have to get outta here!

252
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,164
It's gonna blow!

253
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,798
Arthur, the ceiling!
We'll go that way.

254
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,469
Who are you to give
orders to me?

255
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,554
You're no fair princess!

256
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,936
My cuts were too
perfectly executed

257
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,396
to bring the ceiling down.

258
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,564
[TAMAKI]
Move it!

259
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,940
We need a way out, right?

260
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,819
[TAMAKI yells]

261
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,367
Grab on, you two!

262
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,039
[SHINRA]
I'm saving 'em all!

263
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,009
[JOKER]
Hero or devil?

264
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,636
Shut up, you jerk!

265
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,097
Of course I'm a hero.
I'm a Fire Soldier!

266
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,813
[SHINRA]
Arthur! Cat Girl!

267
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,691
Ah! Help!

268
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,527
God save me.

269
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,947
[TAMAKI]
Captain Burns!

270
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,075
[BURNS]
She's okay.

271
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,911
Make sure those two
reach the ground safely.

272
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,454
Right!

273
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,706
[ARTHUR]
So what about me?

274
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,291
[BURNS]
Look down.

275
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,878
Don't you punk
out on us, Arthur!

276
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,714
Show us the Fighting
Spirit of the Eighth!

277
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,008
Not too sure what he means.

278
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,886
How am I supposed
to fall with spirit?

279
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,144
[ARTHUR]
Ow.

280
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,022
It's pretty lucky that
you're all so muscular.

281
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,775
Who are you calling a
doped‐up neanderthal?

282
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,402
[ARTHUR]
That's not what I said.

283
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,201
[sighs]

284
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,165
[FIREMAN A]
Is anyone hurt?

285
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,710
[FIREMAN B] We need to get
further back just in case.

286
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,628
No one else is in there, right?

287
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,840
[SHINRA]
Hm?

288
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,342
Thanks for takin' care
of my subordinate here.

289
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,429
But for the record, I could've
gotten out by myself.

290
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,806
That was impressive, Shinra.

291
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,474
You did well.

292
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,187
You're giving me more
credit than I deserve.

293
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,023
But thanks anyway.

294
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,941
Shinra, there you are!

295
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,861
Not too shabby. You saved
four more people!

296
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,613
Might have to get
you a cape soon.

297
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,324
I appreciate it, sir.

298
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,410
[BURNS]
Well, we'll be going now.

299
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,835
[BURNS] Tamaki, I'll need a
full report on what happened.

300
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,211
[TAMAKI]
Yes, sir!

301
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,382
That's a good
soldier you've got.

302
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,103
[grunts]

303
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,396
[OBI]
Hm?

304
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,401
[SHINRA] I ran into a
strange man in there.

305
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,153
Someone who could
control explosions

306
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,947
with some kind of powder.

307
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,033
What I saw from him was
a lot like what I saw

308
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,118
at that fire scene
the other day.

309
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,705
Also, he seemed
to know something.

310
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,249
Captain, I have to ask.

311
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,336
Is the Special Fire Force
hiding anything?

312
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,171
[OBI]
Look, Shinra‐‐

313
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,632
[SHINRA] Before you tell
me something else,

314
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,676
the Special Fire Force
really is fighting

315
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,886
for the good of everyone, right?

316
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,264
I joined up to keep
people safe, sir.

317
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,933
Tell me we're heroes.

318
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,520
Please tell me we're fighting
back the terror of the flame.

319
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,358
[OBI]
Yes, we are.

320
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,820
That said, the Special
Fire Force isn't exactly

321
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,239
one monolithic organization.

322
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,367
It was formed with personnel
from three factions:

323
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,787
The Holy Sol Temple,
the Tokyo Armed Forces,

324
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,206
and the Fire Defense Agency.

325
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:12,670
Fact is, most companies still
answer to one entity or another.

326
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,132
The influence of the Temple
is strong at the First.

327
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,969
The Second reports directly
to the Tokyo Armed Forces.

328
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,721
And at the Fifth Company,

329
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,433
the real power is held
by Haijima Industries.

330
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,895
[SHINRA] Haijima? How do
they play into this?

331
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,733
[OBI] All the equipment we Fire
Soldiers use is made by Haijima.

332
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,152
They're more than
just some corporation.

333
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,571
We need them to operate.

334
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,949
They have interests throughout
the nation, and lots of capital,

335
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,785
so they've become
our sole supplier.

336
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,079
It's true that each
company does its duty

337
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:50,124
to fight for the people
and put Infernals to rest,

338
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,128
while seeking the cause of
spontaneous human combustion.

339
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,298
However, the companies
see each other as rivals

340
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,718
and keep what knowledge
they gain to themselves.

341
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,928
Nothing is shared between them.

342
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,017
Not even information about the
truth behind human combustion.

343
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,479
I believe in this organization,
but some companies

344
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,273
may have their own
dubious motives.

345
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,734
Since I can't trust
all its members,

346
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,487
I'm forced to be suspicious
of the larger group.

347
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,696
Wait a second.

348
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:24,366
Does Company Eight have
its own motives, too?

349
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,077
Yeah, I suppose
you could say that.

350
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,748
A group within the agency
strong‐armed us into existence.

351
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,544
They wanted a team led by me.
One they could trust completely.

352
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,631
Our goal is to investigate
Companies One through Seven

353
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,175
so we can zero in on the truth.

354
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,885
[SHINRA]
What truth?

355
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,554
Somebody in the Special Fire
Force should already know

356
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,848
what's causing the
Infernals to appear.

357
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,102
If I can force them to reveal
it, I'll save some lives.

358
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,746
With your leave, sir, I'd be
honored to assist with that.

359
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,461
Thanks, Shinra.

360
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,756
I'm proud to call you a
member of Company Eight.

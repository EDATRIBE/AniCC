1
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,773
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,235
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

3
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,028
But out of that long,
morbid list,

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,698
there's one end that people
fear above all others.

5
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,620
[OBI]
Death by fire.

6
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,128
[ARTHUR] So this is meant
to be my castle.

7
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,929
So what are the Rookie
Fire Soldier Games?

8
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,306
It's a competition where
all the Fire Force rookies

9
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,684
that joined this year get
to show off their abilities,

10
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,602
and it's comin' up pretty soon.

11
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,229
You're gonna represent
Company Eight

12
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,857
alongside our other new recruit,
who we're expecting later today.

13
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,694
Hang on. There's a
new recruit coming?

14
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,487
Indeed there is.

15
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,699
[SHINRA]
Hey, uh, Captain?

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,367
Will there be any Fire Soldiers

17
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,620
aside from us rookies
at this contest?

18
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:22,207
Well, yeah. Some of us'll
come and cheer you all on.

19
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,493
[SHINRA] There could be someone
from another company

20
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,621
who knows about that fire.

21
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,046
Oh, a devil.

22
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,715
Hoped I'd never see you
again, ya damn knight.

23
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,383
What're you doing here?

24
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,177
Thought I'd slay
some hell‐spawn.

25
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,928
Still with the big talk
and dumb pose.

26
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,555
I'll shove that sword up‐‐

27
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,990
Rise and shine, Sputter.

28
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,957
[SPUTTER]
Spu‐Sputter...

29
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,001
You really are
something else, Maki.

30
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,212
The way you control
flames is amazing.

31
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,089
That's sweet of
you to say, Iris.

32
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,592
But honestly, I'm just
a second‐generation.

33
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,218
If I were a third‐gen
like Shinra,

34
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,012
then I'd be able to
make fire on my own

35
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,139
without having to
use any starters.

36
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,433
[SPUTTER]
Sputter?

37
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,358
[SPUTTER]
Sputter? Sputter...

38
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,819
[MAKI]
Careful, it's hot!

39
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,113
[SPUTTER]
Sputter.

40
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,702
We're finally gonna
settle the score for good.

41
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:47,746
Since you insist,

42
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,457
I'll have to show you the
difference in our power.

43
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,921
[MAKI]
Hang on. Who are you?

44
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,634
The realm knows me as Arthur
Boyle, the Knight King.

45
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,557
Might you be the princesses
of this castle?

46
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,391
[MAKI, IRIS]
Huh?

47
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,851
Who, me?

48
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,981
[IRIS] Oh, you must be our new
third‐generation Fire Soldier.

49
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,526
It's nice to have you on board.

50
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,361
[MAKI]
Shinra. Do you know this guy?

51
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,738
Uh‐huh. Met him at the academy.

52
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,074
I told him that knights
have jack on heroes,

53
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,283
so midway through training,

54
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,620
he tacked "king" onto that
made‐up title of his.

55
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,747
What a loser, right?

56
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,332
[MAKI]
Okay...

57
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,501
He pretends he's the
smooth, silent type,

58
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,461
but the truth is,
he's just dumb.

59
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,298
He's literally too idiotic
to come up with words.

60
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,508
And yet...

61
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,218
[MAKI, IRIS]
And yet what?

62
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,554
Girls still think he's
cool for some reason.

63
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,889
Ah. Yes, that.

64
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,558
[chuckles]

65
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,519
I've got way more drive,
but girls just don't care.

66
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,521
No one can resist
a true knight.

67
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:54,938
Wait.

68
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,190
Knight King.
Ladies love a king.

69
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,358
Well, for the record...

70
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,818
[SHINRA]
Huh?

71
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,903
I think that you're
plenty cool, Shinra.

72
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,238
[SHINRA]
Huh...?

73
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,491
Let's see that awkward
smile of yours, Devil.

74
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,285
Say that again.

75
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,287
What's going on?

76
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,538
[MAKI]
Lieutenant Hinawa!

77
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,415
We just met the new
recruit, Arthur.

78
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,877
It turns out that he and Shinra
went to the academy together.

79
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,631
[SPUTTER] Sputter? Sputter,
sputter. Sputter, sputter.

80
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,885
Sputter!

81
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,429
Fire Soldiers don't
play with fire.

82
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,639
Right. Got it.

83
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,145
[HINAWA]
So you're Arthur Boyle.

84
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,689
Sure am. Glad to work with you.

85
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,692
Come on, man. You heard her
call him lieutenant, right?

86
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,528
We all stand as equals
before the round table.

87
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,821
He needn't bow.

88
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,033
Says the lowest‐ranked
soldier in this crew.

89
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,451
<i>Látom</i>.

90
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,042
[HINAWA]
Whatever.

91
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,209
[chuckles]

92
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,130
[HINAWA]
The Rookie Games are coming up.

93
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,341
I wanna see what you've
got in advance.

94
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,177
That means seeing your
powers in action.

95
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,554
Now. Go take them
both on, Maki.

96
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,222
[MAKI]
Wait. Do you mean me?

97
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,183
Do you see anyone
else on this rooftop

98
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,768
who might go by your name?

99
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,394
No, I do not!

100
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,775
[HINAWA]
You lead off, Shinra.

101
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,693
Are we s'posed
to fight for real?

102
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,654
[MAKI]
You don't have to hold back.

103
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,239
Are you certain that
Maki can handle them?

104
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,992
Third generations are extra
powerful, aren't they?

105
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,744
It won't be an issue for her.

106
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,038
Maki started out
in the military.

107
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,208
She understands what it
takes to destroy a man.

108
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,336
Okay. I'm ready to
begin when you are.

109
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,592
[chuckles]

110
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,183
[MAKI growls]

111
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,770
[SHINRA yells]

112
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,271
Whoa, Shinra!

113
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,068
[screaming]

114
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,152
[chuckles]

115
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,997
I really thought I was dead.

116
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,416
Isn't she overdoing it a bit?

117
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,543
Shinra has the instincts
to be a good soldier,

118
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,753
but he's got one
glaring weakness.

119
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,630
Fact is, he needs to be shown

120
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:30,010
that his third‐gen powers
can only get him so far.

121
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,470
You won't beat me
the way you did him.

122
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,097
Excalibur!

123
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,527
It's still lit.

124
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,362
Looks like a plasma cutter.

125
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,322
Excalibur is stalwart.

126
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,035
You'll find it a lot tougher to
extinguish than Shinra's fire.

127
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,080
But what kind of noble
knight would I be

128
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,541
if I injured an
innocent princess?

129
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,296
It looks like chivalry's
dead after all.

130
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,674
A true knight oughtta kneel
when he speaks to a princess.

131
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,056
That's for your lack of respect
toward the lieutenant.

132
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,307
I see now.

133
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,310
You're an ogre disguised
as a princess.

134
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,521
How dare you call me a hideous,
man‐eating, gorilla cyclops!

135
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,856
Didn't say that!

136
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,901
Now I'm doubting you can
understand human speech, ogress.

137
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,071
It seems like he just keeps
throwing more fuel on the fire.

138
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,406
That's a third‐gen
pyrokinetic for you.

139
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,158
I'm not outta the running yet!

140
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,034
[growls]

141
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:36,618
Huh.

142
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,911
You know when you're in combat,

143
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,413
ya start to look
a little brutish.

144
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,665
[IRIS]
Not you too, Shinra.

145
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,792
[growls]

146
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,211
If I can't just snuff
your flames out...

147
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,755
[FLARE]
Flare. Flare...

148
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,424
What the‐‐? Hey, what'd
you do to my fire?

149
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,886
No. You got Excalibur, too?

150
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,680
You should change the
name to Ek‐sputter‐bur.

151
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,766
"Ek‐sputter‐bur"?

152
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,102
So we have a devil
and a knight.

153
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,063
Following the pattern Arthur
and Shinra established,

154
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,482
I guess I'd call Maki a witch.

155
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,442
[MAKI]
Sputter! Flare!

156
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,445
Now come forth!

157
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,490
Bo‐bo‐bo! Bo‐bo, Bo‐bo!

158
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,407
[SHINRA, ARTHUR]
Uh?

159
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,743
"Bo"?

160
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,702
[BOBOBO]
Boh.

161
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,996
Would the two of you
like to continue?

162
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:28,837
[BOBOBO]
Bo. Bo. Bo. Boh.

163
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,505
Think we're out of options.

164
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,091
If you're throwin' in the
towel, then that's that.

165
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,510
Well, it's pretty clear
that you wanna surrender,

166
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,262
so I'll concede.

167
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,764
[BOBOBO]
Bo!

168
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,393
Bo‐bo‐bo! Bo‐bo, Bo‐bo!

169
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,662
[SHINRA, ARTHUR] Is he tryin'
to eat faster than me?

170
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,206
Take the time to chew, will ya?

171
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,595
Refill please.
More extra‐firm noodles.

172
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,473
[ARTHUR, OBI, SHINRA]
Thank you for the food!

173
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,392
Wow, that was some
really tasty fare, Cap.

174
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,894
Arthur, watch your tone.

175
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,854
No worries, I'm glad
ya liked it.

176
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,523
The grub at that
place is top notch.

177
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,775
[SHINRA]
Captain Obi sure is laid back.

178
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,570
Is there anything that
can piss him off?

179
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,613
[SHINRA]
Huh?

180
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,531
Hm. Somethin' wrong, Shinra?

181
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:42,327
Uh. No. I'm doin' swell, sir.

182
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,078
Well, good for you.

183
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,292
[OBI] It isn't healthy to train
right after a big meal,

184
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,670
so there's no choice but to
knock out some office work.

185
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,547
[ARTHUR]
Why's it unhealthy?

186
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,300
[SHINRA] He's even getting
along with that idiot.

187
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,140
This thing's pretty impressive.

188
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,351
The Type Seven Firefighting Ax.

189
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,603
It's a durable melee
weapon that can also fire

190
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,897
a sacred spike from
the head at range.

191
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,191
I've no need for a fire ax.

192
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,652
Excalibur's the only
weapon I wield.

193
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,820
Right, your plasma cutter.

194
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,489
By heating your
flame into plasma

195
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,325
and emitting it from that
bladeless hilt of yours,

196
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,286
you create a super heated,
ultra‐dense sword.

197
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,246
Yeah, fair point.

198
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:31,251
You pyrokinetics might not
need tools like fire axes.

199
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:35,922
Every time I deploy, I've gotta
equip over 30 kilos of gear.

200
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,299
Then there's the issue
of maintaining it all.

201
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,009
It sure would be helpful
if we could hurry up

202
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,886
and hire an engineer.

203
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,722
Might take some pressure
off the Lieutenant.

204
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,350
For the record, I don't
actually mind this work.

205
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,102
[OBI]
Mh‐hm.

206
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:54,107
[alarm blaring]

207
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,236
Another Infernal in Taito‐ward,
Iriya District! Sir!

208
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,924
This one was reported to be
in a single‐family home.

209
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,177
Odds are, we'll be putting them
to rest in close quarters.

210
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,555
Shinra.

211
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,056
You'll be pretty limited
in how you can

212
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,933
maneuver with your feet.

213
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,601
Take the Type Seven.

214
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,690
All of you keep your weapons
hidden inside your coats.

215
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,276
Don't let them be
seen by civilians.

216
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,493
Things are a little
quiet, considering.

217
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,461
First Mama. Now Papa.

218
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,506
How come? Am I gonna be next?

219
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,678
[HINAWA] Apparently, her mother
turned Infernal as well.

220
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,472
Just two years ago.

221
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,893
[OBI] And now she's lost her
Dad, too. Tough break.

222
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,144
[IRIS]
Captain Obi, should I‐‐?

223
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,439
[OBI] No. Let's do this
as gently as we can.

224
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,526
[OBI] I hear there's been
a rash of strange incidents

225
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,863
at recent fire scenes,
so stay on your toes.

226
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,656
Company Eight, we're goin' in.

227
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,075
[COMPANY EIGHT]
Yes, sir!

228
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,625
[OBI]
Shinra. Arthur. C'mere a sec.

229
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,050
[OBI] I thought I told you two
to keep your weapons concealed.

230
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,635
Why should we, though?

231
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,055
There's no rule or regulation
that says it's required.

232
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,307
None of our teachers
mentioned it, either.

233
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,102
Excalibur is more than
a weapon to me.

234
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,771
It's my pride, so why
should I have to hide it?

235
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,440
As Fire Soldiers,
we all have our duty.

236
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:03,486
We must fight the Infernals
in order to put them to rest.

237
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,072
All Infernals were once human.

238
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,366
We can say we're
"putting them to rest,"

239
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,993
but in truth, we kill them.

240
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,420
[OBI] Among the ranks
of the Fire Soldiers,

241
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,381
there are some who think of
themselves as crusaders,

242
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,968
and relish every moment of
combat with the Infernals.

243
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,930
Thing is, that means ignoring
the torment of the bereaved.

244
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,266
The Infernal you put
to rest in battle

245
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,309
is prob'ly someone's dad.

246
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,853
Or wife.

247
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,609
[OBI] Never let the next
of kin see your weapons.

248
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,363
If you can't follow that rule,
I don't want you in my company.

249
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,823
Yes, sir.

250
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,951
[SHINRA]
He's right.

251
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,079
If I'm not there for
those left behind,

252
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,957
then I'm no one's hero.

253
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:02,086
[MAN humming]

254
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,005
[chuckles]

255
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,139
[gasps]

256
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,690
The flames transformed, but why?

257
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,942
Could it've been
the Infernal inside?

258
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,986
[OBI]
Those flames are sneering at us.

259
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,779
Infernals have no sense of self.

260
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,782
It's hard to believe one
of them could do this.

261
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,201
Making entry now.

262
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,243
[SHINRA, ARTHUR]
Right!

263
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,801
[OBI]
Infernal located.

264
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,012
[SHINRA]
He's just sitting there.

265
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,104
[OBI]
Hm?

266
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,196
Why do these things
have to happen?

267
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,244
[ARTHUR]
Captain.

268
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,539
Please let me be the
one to put him to rest.

269
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,374
Wait, let's think about this.

270
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,502
He is an Infernal, but he
hasn't attacked anyone.

271
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,713
Don't be a dumbass.
The man's burning alive.

272
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,008
It's hard to imagine the kind
of pain he's going through.

273
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,719
We need to put him
out of his misery.

274
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:42,019
Time's 1706. Put the
Infernal to rest, Arthur.

275
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,778
I will not allow you to
suffer any more pain

276
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,572
than you already have.

277
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,907
Sister. The prayer, please.

278
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,075
Right.

279
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,620
The flame is the soul's breath.

280
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,623
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

281
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,710
Ashes thou wert and art.

282
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,962
May thy soul return...

283
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,217
[ARTHUR]
...to the great flame of fire.

284
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,560
<i>Látom</i>.

285
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,020
[COMPANY EIGHT]
<i>Látom</i>.

286
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,942
Was that painful?

287
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,070
Yeah. It was.

288
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,072
Well, hang on to that pain,

289
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,575
because the worst thing
this job can do to you

290
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,161
is make you numb to it all.

291
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,958
[MAKI]
Huh?

292
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,883
What was that?

293
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,427
Everyone out!
Before it caves in!

294
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,849
Aren't you coming, sir?

295
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,476
Crap, Captain, look out!

296
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,481
[OBI]
Don't know who did this,

297
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,608
but they must not
know me, either.

298
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,237
I train every day. They'd
need a lot more to crush me.

299
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,949
This damn prank of theirs
has gone way too far!

300
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,125
[MAN] Seems to me this
so‐called Special Fire Force

301
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,878
is only blowin' smoke.

302
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,678
Time to see how well those
clowns can take a joke.

303
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,642
[MAKI]
Captain, are you hurt?

304
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,810
No, I'm all right.

305
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,728
That didn't just
happen on its own.

306
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,231
You think we were attacked
by a third party?

307
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,274
I'm not sure yet.

308
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,611
If so, then they also
trashed a fire scene

309
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,489
that was still full of
memories for the bereaved.

310
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,741
And for that, they will pay.

311
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,160
For now, let's just head back.

312
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,094
Flames took my parents.

313
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,638
And next they're
gonna come for me.

314
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,643
Papa. Mama.

315
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,353
[OBI]
Mikako, right?

316
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,404
Your father fought bravely
to hold back the flame's fury,

317
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,156
and he won that fight.

318
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,532
I think both of your parents

319
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,659
were protecting you
from the flames.

320
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:48,038
They both gave their all to make
sure that you would be okay.

321
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,459
Believe in them.
In the love you felt.

322
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,548
Papa. Mama.

323
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,595
[MIKAKO crying]

324
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,978
[SHINRA] I'm sorry, sir.
I couldn't do anything.

325
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,981
[OBI] It's rare that we can
offer the bereaved much comfort.

326
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,941
And sometimes it
feels just as tough

327
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,569
as charging into
a sea of flames.

328
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,280
But it's still important we try.

329
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,124
[ARTHUR]
Go to sleep, Devil.

330
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:39,381
There's nothing to be seen,
'least not by the likes of you.

331
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,342
Stop wasting your time.

332
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:50,392
[ARTHUR] Sometimes closing your
eyes can help you to see.

333
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,393
[SHINRA]
What's that supposed to mean?

334
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,272
[ARTHUR] If you don't know,
then go to sleep, Devil.

335
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,566
[SHINRA]
Wait, is he‐‐?

336
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,444
[SHINRA]
Why?

337
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,322
[ARTHUR] Just showing some
compassion as a knight.

338
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,162
Wait.

339
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,123
Shut up. I meant Knight King.

340
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,921
[SHINRA]
Hey.

341
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,506
[ARTHUR]
What now?

342
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,967
[SHINRA] Don't talk to me
just 'cause you can't sleep.

343
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,428
[ARTHUR] Pfft. I won't kill
you if you fall asleep first.

344
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,513
Even if you're a devil.

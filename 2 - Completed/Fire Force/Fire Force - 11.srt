1
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,315
This is the incident report
that seems most likely

2
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,609
to be connected to these
White‐Clad attacks.

3
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,070
That's right.
It's from our first job.

4
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,156
Sister Iris and Maki had only
just joined up with the Eighth.

5
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,574
We were all new.

6
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,368
That kinda makes me curious.

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,203
How'd the Eighth start
in the first place?

8
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,580
Good question‐‐I never
got around to asking about

9
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,166
what things were
like before I joined.

10
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,168
[OBI]
Hmm.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,586
It's a long story.

12
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,338
But it relates to the heart
of Company Eight,

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,257
so it's worth telling.

14
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,926
Lieutenant, tell 'em
how we got started.

15
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,052
[HINAWA]
Hm?

16
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,429
[OBI] You're the better
talker by far, so...

17
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,181
Yeah, that's an order.

18
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,052
It's crazy.

19
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,889
The reports of Infernal
breakouts just keep coming.

20
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,057
Makes me wonder.

21
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,142
Maybe instead of
investigating criminals,

22
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,269
we could be helping
out with all that.

23
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,439
Infernals are the Special
Fire Force's jurisdiction.

24
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,191
Don't get any ideas.

25
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,859
Sergeant Hinawa!

26
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,488
[MAKI]
I'll be going now, sir.

27
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:24,079
Haven't seen her around before.
She who I think?

28
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:28,917
Lieutenant General Oze's kid.
That was Private Maki Oze.

29
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,129
[TOJO] She's so thin.
Is she doin' okay?

30
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,589
Oze works twice as
hard as her peers,

31
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,217
and always does more than
she's asked to in training.

32
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,220
At this rate, she'll flesh out
those muscles in no time.

33
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,681
That's impressive for
a general's daughter.

34
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,099
Yeah, but she's
still her father's

35
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,352
sheltered little princess,
and he got her in.

36
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,188
She's far too soft‐hearted
for this line of work.

37
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,275
All the effort she's putting
in will amount to nothing.

38
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,318
Why're you always so critical?

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,155
If she's giving this her all,
then you should help her.

40
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,615
[HINAWA] Wasted effort
doesn't count as effort.

41
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,409
She may as well be slacking.

42
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:06,121
Oh, c'mon. She's a nice kid
who's doin' her best, okay?

43
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,998
You always go easy
on these rookies.

44
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,082
[thud]

45
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,337
Standard USP nine‐millimeter.

46
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,089
Except I got it baptized.

47
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,175
Thought I'd take a page
from the Fire Force.

48
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,260
Another case of wasted effort.

49
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,386
Is it though?

50
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,055
Between a baptized gun
and one that wasn't,

51
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,766
which would you want
to shoot you?

52
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,059
Probably the baptized
gun, right?

53
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,436
[HINAWA]
Hm?

54
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,355
How about it, Hinawa?
Go visit the church.

55
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,442
Get your gun baptized just
to see if it feels different.

56
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,943
I've got a hunch that
your point of view

57
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,279
might change a little bit.

58
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,740
Well, I don't believe in
your so‐called "sun god."

59
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,410
No ritual can alter what happens
when a gun is discharged.

60
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,829
Yeah. I thought you'd
say something like that.

61
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,873
You're the same as ever.

62
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,878
You're a truly
kind person, Tojo.

63
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,880
Why stick with someone like me?

64
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,215
Honestly, man?

65
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,591
It's because you
aren't anywhere near

66
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,843
as cold‐hearted as you think.

67
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,305
You just bussed my tray with
yours without a second thought.

68
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,166
[TOJO screaming]

69
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,501
Tojo.

70
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,254
I'm turning, Hina. Shoot me!

71
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,674
Hurry up. Please!
While I'm still conscious!

72
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,763
[TOJO]
You have to shoot me! Shoot!

73
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,773
[screams]

74
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,609
Which would you want
to shoot you?

75
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,404
Probably the baptized
gun, right?

76
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:07,492
[thud]

77
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,952
[HINAWA gasps]

78
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,036
[gasps]

79
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,088
[HINAWA]
Why couldn't I do it?

80
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,048
Even when he begged?

81
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,767
[INVENTORY KEEPER A]
You're here early, Sergeant.

82
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,102
Just stamped your papers.

83
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:38,064
The late lieutenant's gun
is now yours, as requested.

84
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,150
Thanks, I appreciate it.

85
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,091
[FIRE FIGHTER A] The Blue
Stripes have arrived!

86
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,010
We'll help the civilians
and contain the fire

87
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,387
while they put the
Infernals to rest.

88
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,555
Reporting in!

89
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,391
I've command of on‐scene
fire suppression personnel.

90
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,268
Akitaru Obi.

91
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,188
So I've been told that there
were two Infernals here.

92
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,064
[OBI]
Yes.

93
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:19,814
There are two,

94
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,150
but they're in different
locations at the moment.

95
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,068
The more belligerent one

96
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,946
is currently running
around inside our cordon.

97
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,989
The other one's
been pretty docile.

98
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,367
It's just sitting
inside a store.

99
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,202
I'll pass on that second one.

100
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,746
Yeah, that's not gonna
net us many points.

101
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,122
Wait, "points?"

102
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,666
Thanks for filling me in.

103
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,627
You fire fighters
can pull back now.

104
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,587
We'll deal with the
feisty one first.

105
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,131
I doubt the low point
one's going anywhere.

106
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,258
[FIRE SOLDIERS chuckling]

107
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,015
I beg your pardon,
Mr. Fire Soldier,

108
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,684
but my husband is
patiently enduring

109
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,310
the intense heat
of those flames.

110
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,938
Please, end his suffering
as quickly as you can.

111
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,607
There's an order of
precedence we have to follow.

112
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,735
We'll decide which Infernals
get put out first.

113
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,987
C'mon.

114
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,155
Please! Wait just a moment!

115
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,368
[OBI]
Excuse me.

116
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,079
[growls]

117
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,122
Correct me if I'm wrong,

118
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,040
but you've got a
lotta soldiers here.

119
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,375
Seems like you could
send a couple

120
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,545
to put her husband to
rest without much risk.

121
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,213
We are professionals.

122
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:29,175
We make judgment calls based
on standards of our own.

123
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,760
The point standard.

124
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,053
Yeah, that's right.

125
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,763
To keep up my soldier's spirits,

126
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,765
I give out points based
on how dangerous

127
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,809
the Infernals they kill are.

128
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,769
To keep up their spirits?

129
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,439
When your job involves
snuffing out human lives,

130
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,524
the goal shouldn't be
to have a good time.

131
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:48,403
[FLAIL] You're not the one
risking your life here.

132
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,447
Just hook up your hose

133
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,074
and put out what's left
when we're done.

134
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,788
I'm so sorry. I know it
hurts, but please hold on.

135
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,416
I can't help you,
so try to stay strong.

136
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,834
Pardon, ma'am.

137
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,587
With your permission,
I'd be willing to step in.

138
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,798
I can bring your husband's
suffering to an end.

139
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,550
Would that be all right?

140
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,020
[HINAWA]
What're you planning to do?

141
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,980
[gasps]

142
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,482
Who might you be?

143
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,235
Takehisa Hinawa.
Sergeant with the Armed Forces.

144
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,621
[OBI]
This is Blue Stripes territory.

145
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,165
If a soldier like you or
a fire fighter like me

146
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,543
cuts through that tape,
we'll be severely punished.

147
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,214
[HINAWA]
No punishment could compare

148
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,925
to what the Infernal in this
building is going through.

149
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,593
We both know that.

150
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,513
So, there's nothing
to second guess here.

151
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,518
[OBI]
Sergeant Hinawa.

152
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,687
Do you have any experience
with Infernals?

153
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,315
[HINAWA] I aimed my gun
at a friend the other day...

154
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,859
...as I was watching
him turn Infernal.

155
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,532
But I just couldn't shoot.

156
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,286
I wouldn't call myself
a man of faith

157
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,497
by any stretch of the word.

158
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:28,503
And yet... because my gun was
unbaptized, it just felt wrong.

159
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,385
He really did wait patiently.

160
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,178
Sergeant Hinawa.

161
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,515
I don't think this is about
whether you believe in God.

162
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,767
It's about wanting to do
as much as you can

163
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,229
for the human being whose
life you're about to end.

164
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,277
[OBI] That's why we pray for
them and baptize our weapons.

165
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,196
You ask me, those rituals
offer a type of salvation

166
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,949
to those who kill
Infernals, too.

167
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,619
Start the prayer for us.

168
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,834
[screams]

169
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,545
The flame is the soul's breath.

170
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,214
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

171
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,049
Ashes thou wert and art.

172
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,218
May thy soul return...

173
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,053
[OBI]
I want you to know,

174
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,890
you're a truly kind
person, Sergeant.

00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,851
[inaudible]

176
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,491
What you did in there
took some courage.

177
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,368
No, you're the courageous one.

178
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,162
If I hadn't seen that
you were taking action,

179
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,372
I doubt I would've done a thing.

180
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,167
Making the choice to
take action on your own

181
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,003
isn't really as difficult
as you'd think.

182
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,465
Trusting yourself is something
that comes easy to most,

183
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,509
but to put your faith
in someone else,

184
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,513
and act on that faith,
despite the personal cost,

185
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,224
that takes courage.

186
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,018
You're like a hero,
Sergeant, or a knight.

187
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,021
If so, then that
makes you a king.

188
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,530
It's settled.

189
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,117
I'm gonna create a Special
Fire Force company.

190
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,078
Once I'm in a position to do it,

191
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,956
I'll fight to end
human combustion.

192
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,250
I refuse to sit back
and do nothing

193
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,877
while the world burns
down around me.

194
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,798
It might be a while,

195
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,300
but when it happens,
I'll need people like you.

196
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,428
Soldiers who cherish
life above all else.

197
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,935
Whenever that time arrives,

198
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,521
don't hesitate to
reach out to me.

199
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,445
[OBI] This is our very
own fire cathedral.

200
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,905
[HINAWA]
About as rundown as you'd expect

201
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,533
for a den of outcasts.

202
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,995
So, am I the only crewman
you've recruited, or what?

203
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,746
Yeah. So far.

204
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,082
See, gathering people
who I know I can trust

205
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,501
has been a pretty
difficult task.

206
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,877
[sighs]

207
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,130
I think I've got
a line on someone.

208
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,215
She served under me in the army.

209
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,551
Puts in a lot more effort
than anyone around her.

210
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,178
But she wasn't really
cut out to be a soldier.

211
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,347
She was way too compassionate,

212
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,975
always thinking of
others before herself.

213
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,312
I'd say that makes her a
perfect fit for the Eighth.

214
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,773
Wow.

215
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,358
Way to go, Maki.

216
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,484
Golly.

217
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,652
I just thought I was recruited

218
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,821
because I have basic
pyrokinetic powers

219
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,490
and I'm strong enough
to be a meat shield.

220
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,618
Did you really say those
nice things, Lieutenant?

221
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,245
[MAKI giggles]

222
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,164
[MAKI]
Oh, you're so sweet.

223
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,665
[MAKI giggles]

224
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,084
That was well told. Good job.

225
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,544
The heart of the Eighth
hasn't changed

226
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,629
since the day it
was established.

227
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,797
For the dying Infernal,

228
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,342
we offer our prayers
and a dignified end.

229
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,386
For the living, we seek
deliverance from the flames.

230
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,515
There's one thing we value
above all else: Life.

231
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,654
We should get back to
the subject at hand now.

232
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,241
This report is from right
after Iris and Maki joined.

233
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,827
It was a hot day.

234
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,247
Everyone was nervous, since
it was our first call out.

235
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,167
[HINAWA]
The man who had gone Infernal

236
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,212
was wearing these
odd white clothes.

237
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,672
Putting him to rest was simple,

238
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,093
but there were several
things that didn't add up.

239
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,470
Take the strange
red cross we found.

240
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,055
The man had no family,

241
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,515
but the company he
had worked for

242
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,142
was in an awfully big
hurry to retrieve it.

243
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,227
We looked up that company

244
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,854
and found out that it's
still in business today.

245
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,441
It's based in Asakusa.

246
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,819
Company Seven's jurisdiction.

247
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,031
[CITIZEN A]
What's up, Beni?

248
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,533
[VENDOR A]
Come on by, come on by!

249
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,409
We've got Hoppy for cheap...

250
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,119
[CITIZEN B]
How goes it, Waka?

251
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,329
[VENDOR A] And plenty of
<i>motsuyaki</i> and <i>monja</i>!

252
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,914
[WOMAN A]
Benimaru!

253
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,918
[WOMAN A] I made some
<i>daifuku</i>. Take it with you.

254
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,836
[BENIMARU]
Huh?

255
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,798
I told you before, you old bat,
I don't like sweets.

256
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,765
[BENIMARU]
She makes too much.

257
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:36,018
Ah. Hey, Beni!
It's been a few days!

258
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,104
How bad d'ya miss me?

259
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,983
I wanna see your sweet
ass at the bar tonight.

260
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,026
[KANTARO laughs]

261
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,530
[sighs] Lemme be.

262
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,536
The old bat made <i>daifuku</i>.

263
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,955
If you want some,
then help yourselves.

264
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,501
That crumbling old fossil
makes the best <i>daifuku</i> ever!

265
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,587
If that senile crone
forgets the recipe,

266
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,255
she may as well just die.

267
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,799
[BOTH laugh]

268
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,386
Hinata, Hikage,
you need to listen here.

269
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,387
[HINATA, HIKAGE]
Whoa, there, Waka.

270
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,098
We're not taking any
complaints right now.

271
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,101
You realize they learned
all that from you, right?

272
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,231
Not taking any
complaints right now.

273
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,566
Case in point.

274
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:24,859
This is amazing.

275
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,945
Nothin' tastes better than
an old fossil's last hurrah!

276
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,363
[HIKAGE laughs]

277
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,283
The old bat's swan
song is delicious!

278
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,869
Oh, these students have
surpassed their teacher.

279
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,995
[KONRO groans]

280
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,288
By the way, Waka,

281
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,998
looks like we got a
message from the people

282
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,666
over at Company Eight.

283
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,627
They wanna search
our jurisdiction.

284
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,296
Said something about looking
for that Evangelist.

285
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,674
Too much trouble.
Just ignore them.

286
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,261
Beg your pardon, but
we're already here.

287
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,554
Huh?

288
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,187
You've got some serious nerve,

289
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,648
barging in unannounced
like this.

290
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,775
[OBI] I heard that
Captain Shinmon Benimaru

291
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,778
hated formalities and red tape,

292
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,697
so I thought I'd skip
making an appointment.

293
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,037
Fine, if you're here then,
you're here. Whatever.

294
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,207
But I don't give a damn about
this investigation of yours.

295
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,333
Regardless of the reason,

296
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,336
I can't have you disrupting
things on my turf.

297
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,505
The Evangelist has been
creating Infernals

298
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,257
through artificial means.

299
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,925
And there's a chance
that the White‐Clad

300
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,595
will target the people
of this area next.

301
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,723
That's coming from the
Tokyo Empire, correct?

302
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,891
Well, I'm not a trusting soul,

303
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,227
and I've never seen one of
these so‐called "White‐Clad"

304
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,854
turn someone into an Infernal.

305
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,566
[BOTH scream]

306
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,572
I have no reason to believe
that it's actually happening.

307
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,991
You might not've
seen it, but I have!

308
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,993
[BENIMARU] I don't care
what some imperial lapdog

309
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,203
thinks they saw.

310
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,872
And I'm especially uninterested
in hearing tall tales

311
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,833
from a gullible puppy.

312
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,418
That's funny, 'cause
I'm not interested

313
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,462
in taking crap from
a do‐nothing skeptic.

314
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,133
Captain Shinmon, is that right?

315
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,677
I hear you're the strongest
soldier around.

316
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,096
From what I've been told,
it's because you're so tough

317
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,682
that your town's fire brigade
was brought into the Force.

318
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,142
Well, I'm a tough guy, too.

319
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,353
I'm gonna kick your ass and
make you see things my way.

320
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,108
"Fires and fistfights are
the flowers of Edo," huh?

321
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,619
[CREWMAN A]
Fire! Fire! Fire!

322
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,911
Someone turned Infernal?

00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,873
Why'd you have to go and
jinx us like that, Waka?

324
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,082
Damn it.

325
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,255
I better not see Company
Eight here when I get back.

326
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,639
[BENIMARU]
Must be that way.

327
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,431
Who is it?

328
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,266
That boistrous old man, Kantaro.

He was nagging me about drinking
with him just a minute ago.

331
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,361
Our friend Kantaro from Block
Three has turned Infernal!

What kind of power does the
captain of the Seventh have?

There you are, you old fart!

Waka!

So many houses.

At the end of the day,
homes can always be rebuilt.

344
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,091
But now that Kantaro has
become an Infernal,

his life is over and there's
nothing that can change that.

00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,224
What's goin' on here?

347
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,102
Is he igniting those fires
and controlling the flames?

348
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,397
I think there must be a trick
to those <i>matoi</i> flags he uses.

349
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,275
There's no trick. He started
those fires himself.

350
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,277
Beni can wield both
second‐generation

351
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,696
and third‐generation powers.

352
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,448
He can create his own fires

353
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,742
and manipulate them
as he pleases.

354
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,746
Unlike any other, he's a
compound Fire Soldier.

355
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,882
Look at this, Kantaro!
The whole town is in shambles!

356
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,884
You're too old to be
raisin' this kind of hell,

357
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,260
and you know it.

358
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,346
[roars]

359
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,182
That being said,

360
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,478
you always did enjoy
making a scene, right?

361
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,781
Way to hang in there, friend.

362
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,338
Thanks, young man.

363
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,258
You helped me see him through,
all the way to the end.

364
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,637
So what do you think
of what you just saw?

365
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,806
Did Beni's way of putting
someone to rest

366
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,058
seem a bit rough to you?

367
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,811
Your Sister's prayers
are a gift to your dead.

368
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,939
We destroy our town
as a gift to ours.

369
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,817
Everybody in our world
lives in continuous fear

370
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,361
of the flames of
Infernalization.

371
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,696
We're all looking to our deaths.

372
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,116
As for the people here,
if we have to die,

373
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,954
there's no way we'd prefer
to go out than at his hands.

374
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:15,960
The hands of Shinmon Benimaru,
the Destroyer of Asakusa.

375
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,237
It's too sweet.

1
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,136
[ANNOUNCER A] This train's next
stop is at Tabata Station.

2
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,306
Amaterasu is operating
at full efficiency.

3
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,642
We are running according
to schedule.

4
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:03,981
[yells]

5
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,440
[SAFETY OFFICER A]
Get away from the rail lines!

6
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,650
It isn't safe here.

7
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,319
There's a burning train
heading this way! Move!

8
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,491
[SAFETY OFFICER A]
This way! Move...

9
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,868
That looks like a serious fire.

10
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,289
[COMMUTER A]
Think it's an Infernal.

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,164
[COMMUTER B]
Another one?

12
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,417
[SAFETY OFFICER A]
...and form an orderly line!

13
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,252
[ANNOUNCER B]
...clear the platform at once!

14
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,564
Bet it hurts in there.

15
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,776
[SHINRA]
I can help you with that.

16
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,196
[OBI]
Special Fire Force! Make way!

17
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,949
All civilians
continue to evacuate.

18
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,242
This area's dangerous.

19
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:57,993
[SHINRA]
Uh.

20
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,161
You, too.

21
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,580
Don't just stand around here,
go and join the others.

22
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,956
Wait. Captain, I think‐‐

23
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,083
Hey, Lieutenant.
Care to join us?

24
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,877
Yes. Of course, sir.

25
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,338
[roars]

26
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,964
Commence the operation.

27
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,842
Note the time as O‐810.

28
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,469
[HINAWA, IRIS, MAKI]
Yes, sir!

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,472
[OBI] Sister, would you
begin the prayer, please?

30
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,723
On it.

31
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,560
The flame is the soul's breath.

32
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,605
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

33
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,192
[INFERNAL roars]

34
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,694
[OBI]
Pile bunker's prepped.

35
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,821
I'll bust the core myself!

36
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,333
[IRIS]
Ashes thou wert and art.

37
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,793
May thy soul return...

38
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,169
[OBI yells]

39
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,756
[OBI]
...to the great flame of fire.

40
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,013
<i>Látom</i>.

41
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,307
[OBI]
<i>Látom</i>.

42
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,436
That was awesome.
What a cool team.

43
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,521
[gasps]

44
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,492
[IRIS gasps]

45
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,667
Well, that was close.
You aren't injured, are you?

46
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,918
Oh, no.

47
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,254
What was that?

48
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,130
[gasps]

49
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,214
So you're the one.

50
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:38,301
Yes! Forgive the late intro.

51
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,594
As of this morning,

52
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:43,056
I'll be your new
third‐generation Fire Soldier.

53
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,144
I'm Shinra Kusakabe.
It's an honor to meet you all.

54
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,571
[OBI]
Huh.

55
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,032
So these are the "Devil's
Footprints" I've heard about.

56
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,973
I thought Company
Eight was new,

57
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,476
so why's it quartered
in such an old dump?

58
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,520
Too bad.

59
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,564
Shinra, right? Follow me.

60
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,815
Sir!

61
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,540
[HINAWA]
An old dump, huh?

62
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,667
[SHINRA]
No! It's got character.

63
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,337
[SHINRA]
Reporting in, sir!

64
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,089
[OBI]
Ah. You made it.

65
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,342
I'm captain of the Special Fire
Force's Company Eight.

66
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,678
The name's Akitaru Obi.

67
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,723
You're greeting
a new team member.

68
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,100
Let's maybe get
off the pullup bar.

69
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,935
Can do.

70
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,937
Takehisa Hinawa.

71
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,690
Around this dump,
I'm second in command.

72
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,613
So hey, Shinra.

73
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,823
About your résumé photo...

74
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,199
Why are you smiling?

75
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,577
Sir! Apologies.

76
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,996
When I'm nervous, my face
compulsively tightens

77
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,540
in such a way that my
teeth are exposed.

78
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,333
Huh?

79
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:00,879
Uh, that is... I tend to
smile when I feel tense.

80
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,213
‐‐My face‐‐
‐‐[OBI] Hm?

81
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,968
[OBI]
Mm...

82
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,180
[OBI]
Hmm...

83
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,058
[chuckles]

84
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:18,271
[OBI laughing]

85
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,731
Sorry about that.

86
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,400
Just wanted to see
for myself. You get it.

87
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,236
I bet that cute little quirk
gets you in a lotta trouble.

88
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,031
True. It's caused a few
misunderstandings.

89
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,450
Man, your poker face
must be somethin' else!

90
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,326
[OBI laughing]

91
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,827
[SHINRA]
Did he call it cute?

92
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,163
Pretty sure he means creepy.

93
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,624
So tell me, Shinra,

94
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,585
why did you decide to join the
Fire Force in the first place?

95
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,671
Sir!

96
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,924
Honestly, I just
wanted to be a hero.

97
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,676
[OBI]
Heh.

98
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,928
Well, that's as fine
an ambition as any,

99
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,180
but don't forget
you're part of a team.

100
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:56,017
Cool‐headed co‐ordination
saves more lives than heroics.

101
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,436
A hero, huh?

102
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,146
Correct me if I'm wrong,

103
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,649
but that's in stark contrast
with your nickname.

104
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,984
Everybody calls you a devil

105
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,028
due to an incident that took
place when you were young.

106
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,572
If you act like you talk,
you'll do fine.

107
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,949
But if you're just
some delinquent

108
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,994
who's trying to clean
up his reputation,

109
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,413
you may as well walk out now.

110
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,502
[MAKI]
Sister.

111
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,963
[IRIS]
Yes, Maki? What is it?

112
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,881
[MAKI] That new recruit
swept you off your feet

113
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,508
like you were a princess.

114
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,470
He came outta nowhere and saved
you from danger, so, uh...

115
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,932
Tell me, did you feel
like he might be the one?

116
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,017
[IRIS]
Hm?

117
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,400
[IRIS] Maki always act so fierce
and cool in the field.

118
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,484
But the fact is,

119
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,612
her head's stuffed with
flowers and sparkles.

120
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,201
Reporting in, sir!

121
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,119
[OBI]
Hm?

122
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,748
Hi, I'd like to thank you
for helping me earlier.

123
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,750
Yeah, sure.

124
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,421
I just did what any hero would.

125
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,547
[MAKI gasps]

126
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,799
Wow, he really is the one.

127
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,972
This is a time for love,
not war, Iris!

128
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:16,765
And I really don't think

129
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,141
you should stoop
to violence anyway.

130
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,852
I mean, you're a nun,
you silly goober.

131
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,189
[MAKI, IRIS whimpering]

132
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,816
[MAKI] I adjusted the
length of your pants

133
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,569
to accommodate that
ability of yours.

134
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,738
Do you think they're
gonna work for you?

135
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,574
Yeah. Thank you very‐‐

136
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,617
[MAKI]
Hm?

137
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,496
[SHINRA]
Why does she smell so good?

138
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,040
[OBI] Easy, Turbo. You look
like you wanna eat her.

139
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,083
Say what?

140
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,752
I already explained,
it's an involuntary‐‐

141
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,675
[BOTH]
Hm?

142
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:57,263
Well, I think it's just
about time, Captain.

143
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,810
Yeah. Everyone's here now,
so let's get started.

144
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,066
[OBI] All of us know about
spontaneous human combustion,

145
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,362
but no one, not even us here,
knows when it'll happen next,

146
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,530
or to whom.

147
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,157
And so, we all live in fear.

148
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,454
[OBI] One day, without
cause or warning,

149
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,207
people the world over
began catching fire.

150
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,251
These were the
first‐generation victims

151
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,586
of spontaneous human combustion.

152
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,256
They, and those like them
who've come since,

153
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,966
are called Infernals.

154
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:37,303
Having lost all sense of self,
they run rampant until they die.

155
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,222
Those deaths don't come easy.

156
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,809
To put an Infernal to rest,
you have to destroy its core

157
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,062
by striking where the
victim's heart was.

158
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,814
The Special Fire
Force's main duty

159
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,899
is to put Infernals to rest,

160
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,695
saving their souls and
human lives in the process.

161
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,613
But we all have
another objective.

162
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,992
That's to solve the mystery of
what causes human combustion.

163
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,785
And with luck, to stop it,

164
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,205
and put an end to the terror
of the flame for good.

165
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,332
As quickly as we can.

166
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,962
[SHINRA]
I wanna become a hero.

167
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,299
No. I have to become one.

168
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,646
Mother.

169
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,941
Hey, Mom! Guess what?

170
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,985
I'm gonna be a superhero!

171
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,321
I'll keep you and
Sho safe forever!

172
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,406
Well, that sure sounds cool.

173
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,782
[chuckles]

174
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,162
Devil!

175
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,165
[SHINRA'S GRANDMOTHER]
No, I won't "take him in"!

176
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,833
That boy is dangerous.

177
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,211
[GOVERNMENT AGENT A] Please,
ma'am. He's your grandson.

178
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,004
Don't say anything
you'll regret.

179
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,547
[SHINRA'S GRANDMOTHER]
I'll say what I know.

180
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,841
That is no grandson of mine.

181
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,552
Do you have any idea
what he's done?

182
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,097
And look at him.
Not a shred of remorse.

183
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,226
He's grinning like
the devil he is.

184
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,484
[SHINRA] I made a promise,
and I'll keep it.

185
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,822
[alarm blaring]

186
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,782
The alarm!

187
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,159
[MAKI] Shinra! Someone
just turned Infernal!

188
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,994
Be ready in 30 seconds!

189
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,079
On it!

190
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,338
Our Infernal is in Taito
ward, Torigoe District.

191
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,674
The fire's at a small factory.

192
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,552
The person who turned Infernal
is the factory manager's wife.

193
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,939
[OBI]
We'll work with Squad Four

194
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,566
of the Fire Defense
Agency's Ueno branch

195
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,402
and put her to rest.

196
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,285
[OBI] Get in the Matchbox!
Let's do this!

197
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,465
[ANNOUNCER A] Emergency vehicles
are about to deploy.

198
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,426
We request that all
civilian motorists

199
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,636
pull to the side of the
road and clear a path

200
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,680
so they can safely pass.

201
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:31,227
Special Fire Force Company
Eight, moving out.

202
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,779
Here comes your
chance to be a hero.

203
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,031
[chuckles]

204
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,428
[FIREFIGHTER A]
It's the Blue Stripes.

205
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,098
[FIREFIGHTER CAPTAIN A]
From what we've been seeing,

206
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,559
this Infernal is
especially aggressive.

207
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,270
We've been able to keep
the flames contained so far,

208
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,314
but as long as the
Infernal's active,

209
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,523
there's a risk that more build‐‐

210
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,233
Excuse me.

211
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,278
[MANAGER]
Please help my wife, Sister.

212
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,405
See that she's put to rest.

213
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,742
[IRIS] Infernals are lost
souls shrouded in flame.

214
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,577
We'll offer your wife mercy,

215
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,247
and a return to the embrace
of the great god Sol.

216
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,501
[OBI] Special Fire
Force Company Eight,

217
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,710
it's time we went in.

218
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,836
[COMPANY EIGHT]
Right!

219
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,217
Done! You like it?

220
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,845
Oh, yeah! I can keep
everybody safe now!

221
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,184
'Kay, so whaddaya think?

222
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,394
Do I look all super?

223
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,521
Yup. My little hero.

224
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,523
[laughs]

225
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,115
[OBI]
She's further in.

226
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,659
[MAKI] These flames,
they feel conscious,

227
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,078
like they're actively
trying to stop us.

228
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,080
[IRIS] This place
must've been important.

229
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,957
To the Infernal, I mean.

230
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,382
[SHINRA]
Mom. Sho!

231
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,884
[INFERNAL roars]

232
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,517
Hey, Shinra! You okay, bud?

233
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,146
Huh? I was just...

234
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,690
[OBI] You still wanna
be a hero, don't you?

235
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,860
Listen, Fire Soldiers don't
abandon their comrades.

236
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,238
When you fall behind, we all do.

237
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,282
The bright blue stripes
that ring our bodies

238
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,825
aren't just for show,

239
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,994
they're what bind
us all together.

240
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,913
In this hellscape
of smoke and flame,

241
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,790
trust in that bond.

242
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,251
The fear you feel
is a survival tool.

243
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,336
It helps to keep you alive.

244
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,797
Just don't let it
make you a coward.

245
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,262
Understood, sir.

246
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,348
Maki!

247
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,642
[MAKI]
Right! Clearing a path!

248
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,820
[OBI] The flames are
getting sucked in!

249
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,030
Shinra!

250
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,116
[COMPANY EIGHT]
Shinra!

251
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,290
[SHINRA'S MOTHER]
Shinra!

252
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,877
[SHINRA'S MOTHER]
Don't look, honey.

253
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,005
You need to run away! Hurry!

254
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,009
[SHINRA]
Mom.

255
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,388
[PASSERBY A]
That's her eldest son Shinra.

256
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,516
They say he caused the fire.

257
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,060
[PASSERBY B] His younger brother
Sho was burnt completely.

258
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,187
They couldn't even
find his bones.

259
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,940
[PASSERBY A] I heard them say
that he's a third‐generation.

260
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,650
They can create fire at will.

261
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,902
[PASSERBY C]
How terrifying.

262
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,074
[SHINRA]
I can't run away from this.

263
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,951
[SHINRA]
It wasn't me.

264
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,787
[SHINRA]
When my home burned,

265
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,374
I saw someone, or something...

266
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,421
[SHINRA] Something other
than Mom, or Sho, or me.

267
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,260
[SHINRA]
And I'm gonna find out what.

268
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,887
[PASSERBY A] That smile
of his‐‐it's so creepy.

269
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,389
He's a psychopath.

270
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,848
A devil.

271
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,814
[SHINRA] Since that day,
I haven't truly smiled once.

272
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,234
[HINAWA]
Devil! Hey, Devil!

273
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,570
Wake up, you damn delinquent!

274
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,449
[SHINRA]
What's with this blue light?

275
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,205
[HINAWA] You know, with a
badass nickname like "Devil,"

276
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,873
I figured you'd be tougher.

277
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,000
Try to sit up.

278
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,837
I must've been out
for a while. How long?

279
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,506
You're fine. It was
like five seconds.

280
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,258
Now get up already.

281
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,010
We're gonna need
you in action soon.

282
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,678
[MAKI] How do you feel?
Can you fight?

283
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,971
Yeah.

284
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,521
[OBI]
Everyone, prepare for battle!

285
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,196
[OBI]
Time is 2110.

286
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,657
Commencing operation to
put Infernal to rest.

287
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,867
[COMPANY EIGHT]
Yes, sir!

288
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,872
[OBI] Shinra, Maki and I
will draw her attention,

289
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,416
then you can end this
with one good kick.

290
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,667
Right.

291
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,879
[OBI]
Let's do it!

292
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,646
[MAKI screams]

293
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,902
[OBI grunting]

294
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,911
[OBI] Thanks. Improved
Type Two Fire Ax thrust!

295
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,886
[SHINRA]
I made two promises.

296
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,848
That I'd be a hero, and
that I'd protect my family.

297
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,398
[SHINRA]
Mom. Sho. I'm sorry.

298
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,026
I couldn't keep
that last promise.

299
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,488
But I'll honor your memory
by becoming a hero.

300
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,460
[SHINRA]
Hope you're watching.

301
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,295
Here I go.

302
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,302
I refuse to be what
they say I am.

303
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:24,306
No matter what I have
to do, I will be a hero!

304
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,561
All set. Make me proud, hero!

305
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,479
[SHINRA]
Will do.

306
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,531
Sister! Start the prayer!

307
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,907
[IRIS]
Right.

308
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:42,992
Captain Obi!

309
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,995
[OBI] Good luck, Shinra!
Aim for the core!

310
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,798
[SHINRA'S GRANDMOTHER]
That boy is a devil!

311
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,220
[IRIS]
The flame is the soul's breath.

312
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,474
[PASSERBY B] Repulsive.
What a twisted smile.

313
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,229
[IRIS] The black smoke
is the soul's release.

314
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,607
Ashes thou wert and art.

315
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,942
May thy soul return...

316
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,530
I know you're in pain.

317
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,037
Just let go!

318
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:38,714
Oh, wow. The third generation's
as strong as they say.

319
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,217
...to the great flame of fire.

320
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,263
[IRIS]
<i>Látom</i>.

321
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,858
[MANAGER]
Sister, is‐is my wife...?

322
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,443
[IRIS]
Her soul is safe.

323
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,071
She's been returned
to the Great Fire.

324
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,699
Shinra put her to rest swiftly,
so she wouldn't suffer.

325
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,168
Thank you, Shinra. I'm grateful.

326
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,962
You set her free.

327
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:26,428
[CROWD cheering, applauding]

328
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,389
[OBI]
Feels pretty good, right?

329
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,517
You'll be receiving cheers
like these from now on.

330
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,352
[SHINRA'S MOTHER]
My little hero.

331
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,690
I'd say you've taken
a pretty big step

332
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,900
towards that goal of yours.

1
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,195
[PRIEST A] You needn't appear
in person, Your Excellency.

2
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,404
[PRIEST B]
It's essential that this crisis

3
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,365
needs to be addressed,
but let us‐‐

4
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,658
It's fine.

5
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,868
Assemble the eight
Company captains.

6
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,620
I'll speak with them.

7
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:45,796
[MAMORU‐KUN]
Goodness.

8
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,298
What the hell am I looking at?

9
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,095
[OBI yells]

10
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,643
Damn it, Shinra!

11
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,145
My locker has been
violated again!

12
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,438
Enough, already!

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,691
But, sir, I didn't do anything.

14
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,486
Shinra is very busy enjoying the
handmade lunch I just gave him.

15
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,738
Don't interrupt.

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,283
Guess this means you're
the one behind that mess.

17
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,742
Don't you have an entire company

18
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,744
you're s'posed to be
running right now?

19
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,955
Yes, but I thought I'd go
to the conference today

20
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,748
with you and Shinra.

21
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,710
Now, don't get the wrong idea.

22
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,296
I forgot I'd packed a lunch and
bought myself this sweet roll,

23
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,798
only to realize I had
more food than I needed.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,301
I had no choice but
to give it to Shinra.

25
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,970
It isn't like I made it
for him specifically.

26
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,598
I'm not worrying about
lunch right now.

27
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,517
Shinra! Tell the captain
to cut this crap out.

28
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,562
Huh? How come? The lunch
is really good, sir.

29
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,648
Is it now? Glad you like it.

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,151
Damn it. She's playing dirty.

31
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,235
Help me out and I'll treat you

32
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,404
to all the ramen
you want sometime.

33
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,156
I do love ramen.

34
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,408
I'll come as well.

35
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,160
Go get yourself lost again.

36
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:58,994
What?

37
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,912
I want ramen, too!

38
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,623
She's coming! Run!

39
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,876
[TAMAKI screams]

40
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,963
[SHINRA]
Lucky, my butt.

41
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,840
[grumbles]

42
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,009
Hey. Do the two of
you want i‐‐? Er!

43
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,262
[MAKI, IRIS]
Oh! Wow!

44
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,932
Hinawa. She's playing with
fire inside the office.

45
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,102
I need to make sure we take
the best route to Central.

46
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,687
[SHINRA, ARTHUR,
TAMAKI shouting]

47
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,272
Just stay away from me,
you skirt‐snatching devil!

48
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,523
[SHINRA]
It fell off on its own!

49
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,068
[ARTHUR]
Begone, skirt devil!

50
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,570
There's a great bakery
not too far from here.

51
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,449
Yeah. We know. It's the best.
Maki and I go all the time.

52
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,534
Yeah, they just
updated their menu.

53
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,869
They've got more savories!

54
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,413
The cakes have always been
great, but now they have...

55
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,166
The place sure
has gotten lively.

56
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,292
[grunts]

57
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,642
You sure it's okay,
us two tagging along?

58
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,770
The topic of this conference
is the Evangelist

59
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,647
and the so‐called
White‐Clad organization.

60
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,691
You two are the best
sources of information

61
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,443
we have on the subject.

62
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,904
Do the captains have
conferences often?

63
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,781
Or is this something special?

64
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,782
[OBI]
It's rare.

65
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,158
This hasn't happened even once

66
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,951
since I took command
of the Eighth.

67
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,578
That should tell
you how seriously

68
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,538
the country's taking this.

69
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,173
[CHILD B screams]

70
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,425
[OBI]
Man‐made Infernals.

71
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,889
[ARROW] Direct hit.
Hoshimiya has been eliminated.

72
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,975
We should tell the
commander what happened.

73
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,769
[OBI]
The White‐Clad.

74
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,895
[laughs]

75
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,564
[REKKA] Behold the radiance
of the blazing star

76
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,399
ensconced in the heavens!

77
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,109
What greater end could we seek

78
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,278
than a return to
Sol's warm embrace?!

79
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,239
We will set all human
beings alight.

80
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,783
Engulf the Earth in the
great flame of fire!

81
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,369
Let its imperfections
be burned away

82
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,496
by the flames of salvation!

83
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,874
All is in accordance with
the will of the Evangelist!

84
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,627
[OBI]
Then there's this "Evangelist."

85
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,922
I have no doubt,
if we follow this trail,

86
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,967
we can end this Infernal
outbreak for good.

87
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,639
Oh, whoa! Is that
what I think it is?

88
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,517
Yeah. Of course.

89
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,353
Wait, have you never seen
it before? Cool, right?

90
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,522
That thermal plant was built
when the Solar calendar

91
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,232
was first put into place.

92
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,861
Our perpetual power
plant: Amaterasu.

93
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,908
Amaterasu provides electricity
for the entire Empire.

94
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,329
So it all comes from there?
Must have some crazy firepower.

95
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,258
Thanks again for everything
you did the other day.

96
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,927
[SHINRA] No. I should be
the one thanking you.

97
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,435
I'm Lieutenant Karim Flam.
Part of Company One.

98
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,106
Shinra told me all about
what happened with Rekka.

99
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,151
I want to find out
why Rekka betrayed us.

100
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,279
Towards that end, I want to work
with you guys at the Eighth.

101
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,116
I hear you're a capable
man, so thanks.

102
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,336
[GIOVANNI] I thought we shared
an allegiance to Haijima.

103
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,212
Was I mistaken?

104
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,714
What're you trying to say?

105
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,591
[GIOVANNI] You've been
spending quite a bit of time

106
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,301
with the Eighth.

107
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,096
[HIBANA]
Heh. You're being ridiculous.

108
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,849
The captains' conference
is about to start.

109
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,188
The Seventh is here,

110
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,857
and they don't normally
show up for anything.

111
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,859
Tells you how urgent this is.

112
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,319
That's their captain?

113
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,657
They say he's the strongest
soldier in the force. Crazy.

114
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,202
The hell are you
grinning at, snot face?

115
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,495
Waka.

116
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,967
Come on. Tent hands.

117
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,344
The time has come.

118
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:35,515
All Company captains, as well
as their guests, have arrived.

119
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,107
[RAFFLES III] Let's begin this
emergency conference at once.

120
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,068
I've spoken with the
general of the Tokyo Army

121
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,530
and the chief of the
Fire Defense Agency.

122
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,241
They told me of a group
acting in secret.

123
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,410
Threatening our nation's safety.

124
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,037
Indulging in blasphemy,

125
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,540
they would defile the
great Sol's blessings.

126
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,251
Brave captains of the
Special Fire Force,

127
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,671
I call on you to make these
blasphemers pay for their sins.

128
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,340
Would ya stop rambling
about your sun god?

129
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,384
What? Benimaru Shinmon!

130
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,428
You stand before
our great Emperor!

131
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,181
You should cease your insolence
and treat him with respect,

132
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,557
or face Gustav Honda's wrath!

133
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,642
Shut your mouth, Honda Gustav.

134
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,270
I don't like hearin' my
name said backwards.

135
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,355
He prefers his surname first?

136
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,650
[GIOVANNI] You must be
a proto‐nationalist.

137
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,612
Look, the Seventh is nothing
but a bunch of idiots

138
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,447
from the vigilante corps.

139
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,699
I don't recall swearing
any oaths to your god

140
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,243
or your empire.

141
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,287
We're gonna keep on
as we have been.

142
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,456
[GUSTAV] Hey! Come back!
We aren't finished talking yet!

143
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,916
Stop right there.

144
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,125
[door closes]

145
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,175
[RAFFLES III coughs]

146
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:56,513
As I was saying, I want all your
companies to work together

147
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,849
and defeat the Evangelist.

148
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,394
That will put us back on
the path to saving mankind

149
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,604
from the fear of the flames.

150
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,441
It sounds like they're
getting closer.

151
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:13,863
Not too shabby, Devilfoot.
He did it sooner than expected.

152
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,491
The boy has real potential.

153
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,202
Maybe I'll pay him
another visit soon.

154
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,621
Shinra Kusakabe.

155
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,664
[SHINRA]
Yes, sir!

156
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,334
[RAFFLES III] I understand
you possess an Adolla Burst.

157
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,467
Rekka Hoshimiya said that I did.

158
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,139
[SHINRA] Sir, what exactly
is an Adolla Burst?

159
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,684
[RAFFLES III] It is an unsullied
flame of absolute purity.

160
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,644
The primordial flame.

161
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,606
The spark from which Sol
fashioned the world we live in.

162
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,651
When you were coming here,
did you not see it?

163
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,735
[SHINRA]
Hm?

164
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,989
[RAFFLES III] Tokyo's perpetual
thermal energy plant.

165
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,325
Amaterasu provides power
for the whole Empire.

166
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,621
All that energy comes from
a flame, which, like yours,

167
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
is an Adolla Burst.

168
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,550
[GIOVANNI]
It seems that the Evangelist

169
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,886
wishes to obtain Adolla Bursts.

170
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,764
It's known that these are
flames of high purity.

171
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,474
But how they differ
from common flames

172
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,144
has yet to be explained
by science.

173
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:30,273
Unless the Evangelist found
the difference before we could.

174
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,110
[GIOVANNI] The Evangelist
will target Kusakabe.

175
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,404
Perhaps he should be secured.

176
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,240
Secured? Please
don't lock me up.

177
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,368
I joined the Force so
I could protect people.

178
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,495
I can look after
myself just fine.

179
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,956
There's no reason for companies
outside of the Eighth

180
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,167
to meddle in the
Eighth's affairs.

181
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,543
We should all focus our energy

182
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,671
on finding and hunting down
the White‐Clads.

183
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,885
The Third wants to use
Shinra as a specimen.

184
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,054
I guarantee Shinra's safety.

185
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,432
Company Eight will make sure
that he never gets captured.

186
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,480
The Adolla Burst is sacred,

187
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,608
and Sol has chosen
you to possess it,

188
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,235
so treat it with care.

189
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,569
Right.

190
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,533
[MAMORU‐KUN]
Goodness.

191
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,701
[OBI]
We're back.

192
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,286
[TAMAKI]
How've you guys been?

193
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,081
Not too bad.
I'll go make some tea.

194
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,917
[OBI] Felt like this tie
was gonna choke me.

195
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,754
[Pardon, sir, but didn't
Shinra go to Central with you?

196
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,672
[OBI]
Yeah.

197
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,257
But he wanted to
check out Amaterasu

198
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,259
and catch up with us later.

199
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,677
So, I'll cover for him

200
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,929
if we have to move
out before he's back.

201
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,390
With Tamaki 'n Arthur,
we're fine.

202
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,436
Heh. More work for me, eh?

203
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,321
[SHINRA] If the Evangelist
is planning to come to me,

204
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,574
that suits my purposes fine.

205
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,494
[JOKER]
Long time no see, Devilfoot.

206
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,912
[gasps]

207
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,497
How are ya?

208
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,429
[SHINRA]
You!

209
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,682
[JOKER] Adolla Bursts
are powerful things.

210
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,311
One serves as the power
source for the Amaterasu.

211
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,856
One was used to create
this very world.

212
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,232
Though I guess I should mention

213
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:40,069
it was also the cause of
this world's downfall.

214
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,696
Whoa, there. Calm down.

215
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,532
I'm not in the mood
for fisticuffs today.

216
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:48,411
Though if you insist on having
a 'bout, I'm up for it.

217
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,457
You don't actually think you'd
manage to get a lick in,

218
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,126
do ya, Devilfoot?

219
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,462
[JOKER chuckles]

220
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:05,178
I've graced you with my presence
'cause you earned a new clue.

221
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,930
Call it your reward for
finding the White‐Clad spy

222
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,392
and getting closer to the truth.

223
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,311
You're close already.

224
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,189
I came to turn suspicion
into certainty.

225
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,024
[SHINRA]
What are you saying?

226
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,193
[JOKER]
Keep pursuing that Evangelist

227
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,321
and you will find your brother.

228
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,490
The commander of the
Evangelist's Knights

229
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,577
of the Ashen Flame...
is Sho Kusakabe.

230
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,829
Your long‐lost brother.

231
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:38,753
So then, Sho is with the
Evangelist serving as a knight?

232
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,677
What do you mean?! Uh!

233
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,596
Joker!

234
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:52,725
[JOKER] Hell is a perfect
fit for a Devil.

235
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,946
[SHINRA]
Mom. Sho. I'm sorry.

236
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,449
I couldn't keep
that last promise.

237
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,326
[SHINRA]
Mom. Sho!

238
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,413
[SHINRA'S MOTHER wails]

239
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,457
[SHINRA]
I failed...

240
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:20,628
But there's still a
promise I <i>can</i> keep.

241
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,797
If what he says is true,

242
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,510
then soon, I'll have
to fight my brother.

243
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,138
I said I'd become a superhero.

244
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,266
I said I'd keep
Mom and Sho safe.

245
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:37,186
I was too weak to protect Mom,
but I'm strong now.

246
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,605
And that promise
binds me to Sho‐‐

247
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,359
every bit as much as
the blood we share.

248
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,654
So I won't break my
word. Not again.

249
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,639
The Fire Force has been ordered
to go after the Evangelist.

250
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,308
To start, we'll look for clues

251
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,060
in every fire report
we've filed.

252
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,023
This is only a fraction
of what we have.

253
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,524
Be fast, but thorough.

254
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,235
If it might relate to the
White‐Clad, call it out.

255
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,488
The Evangelist and
the White‐Clad group

256
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,907
have been forcefully turning
humans into Infernals

257
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,575
for unknown reasons.

258
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,995
We can't allow even one of
them to get away with it.

259
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,165
Go get started.

260
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,766
[sighs]

261
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,017
[BOTH]
Uh?

262
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,527
Hey, Shinra. Hurry up and
find us a lead already.

263
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,653
What's the matter?

264
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,322
All this heavy brain‐work
takin' its toll on ya?

265
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,908
Just keep goin'
till ya die, okay?

266
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,043
[wheezing]

267
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:28,548
Like watchin' a candle
in the wind. Sweet.

268
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,591
Let's take a little
break for now.

269
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,551
[SHINRA]
Aw.

270
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,095
But if Arthur goes any
longer, he's gonna die.

271
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:34,971
Let's keep pushing.

272
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,640
[stomach growls]

273
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,642
Sister Iris should get
back from consoling

274
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,936
the next of kin before too long.

275
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,230
Why don't we girls cook
something for everyone?

276
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,523
Sure, I'm down!

277
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,525
How's that sound
to you, Lieutenant?

278
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,236
Could go poorly. Prob'ly will.

279
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:54,198
I just ignore him when he's
rude. It's fine, let's go.

280
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,659
I bet Maki's a great cook.

281
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,078
[gasps]

282
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,621
[HINAWA]
What's this?

283
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,290
[MAKI, TAMAKI scream]

284
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,333
Crap! Maki!

285
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,795
[TAMAKI] Cut it out, Kusakabe!
Don't look at me!

286
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,798
How in the blue blazes did
you end up looking like that?

287
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,842
You put the apron
over your clothes!

288
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,468
Yeah, she's a bit
of an exception

289
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,929
when it comes to
the laws of physics.

290
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,097
[sighs]

291
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:22,518
[HINAWA] Maki, go get Tamaki
back in her uniform, okay?

292
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,811
I'll handle dinner.

293
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,771
[TAMAKI yells]

294
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,400
You're helping, Shinra.

295
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,819
Uh. Sure. Will do.

296
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,634
Are you okay?

297
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,801
[SHINRA]
Uh?

298
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,846
[HINAWA] If it's not
something you can tell me,

299
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,806
you should go to the captain.

300
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,523
Y'know, I'm really
fond of this company.

301
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,359
I know it can be difficult,

302
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,070
but I'd like you rookies
to be able to trust us.

303
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,451
[SHINRA]
Honestly, Lieutenant,

304
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,913
I think I like it at the
Eighth just as much as you.

305
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,916
As for the other thing,
I do trust you.

306
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,250
You and the captain.

307
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,835
So, thanks.

308
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,295
[HINAWA]
No problem.

309
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,137
Dinner's ready everyone!
It's all set in the dining room.

310
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,264
Yay!

311
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,557
[grunts]

312
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:57,029
So how do you think
Shinra's holding up?

313
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,365
We put a lot on his shoulders
in the investigations

314
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,534
of the Fifth and the First.

315
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,748
You haven't recruited
any pushovers, sir.

316
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,502
Shinra's gonna be all right.
No doubt in my mind.

317
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,218
[TAMAKI] Awesome!
You made this, Kusakabe?

318
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,971
Nah. Just helped out
the lieutenant.

319
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,558
[TAMAKI]
Uh...

320
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,393
[ALL]
Thank you for this meal!

321
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,311
[MAMORU‐KUN]
Thank you for this meal.

322
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,446
Take time to chew, will ya?

323
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,496
Thank goodness.

324
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,458
It looks like you're
feeling better.

325
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,169
We were talking about how
weird you'd been acting.

326
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,130
I thought maybe you had an
upset stomach or something.

327
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,008
But if you're eating that much,
you must be fine.

328
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,023
Listen, everyone,

329
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,817
I know it's sudden,
but I need to say something.

330
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,322
Truth is...

331
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,787
[SHINRA]
I told them.

332
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,955
About meeting Joker.

333
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,125
About my brother, Sho.

334
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:38,297
Company Eight felt like family,
and I decided to trust them.

335
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,301
It's quite the tale.

336
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,095
But all of this is coming
from Joker, right?

337
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,722
Do you think we can trust it?

338
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,809
Couldn't tell ya.
I dunno what to believe.

339
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,018
In that case...

340
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,811
[OBI]
Shinra.

341
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,561
[SHINRA]
Huh?

342
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:53,771
Tell me.

343
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,774
Do you want to believe that
your brother's still alive?

344
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,734
Because that's what matters.

345
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,486
Yes, sir, I do.

346
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,572
Understood.

347
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:13,040
Well, then, all of us'll
have to believe he is, too.

348
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,751
We still need to go
after the Evangelist.

349
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,670
But we'll form our strategy
around the premise

350
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,880
that Shinra's brother
is with him.

351
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,509
[SHINRA]
Thanks so much, sir.

352
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,932
[EVANGELIST FOLLOWERS] We will
set all lost souls alight.

353
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,977
Burn the earth beneath our feet,

354
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,438
and make this planet
a flaming sun.

355
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,567
A scorched throne worthy of god.

356
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:44,071
All is in accordance with
the will of the Evangelist.

357
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,448

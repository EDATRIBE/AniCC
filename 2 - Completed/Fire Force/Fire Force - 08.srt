1
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,773
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,235
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

3
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,028
But out of that
long, morbid list,

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,532
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

5
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,511
[MAN] Yes. I'm performing
your works as instructed.

6
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,013
There may be a few
minor obstacles,

7
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,807
but I'll overcome them.

8
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,978
Infernalization will
continue unimpeded.

9
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,815
Understood, Evangelist.

10
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,358
<i>LÃ¡tom</i>.

11
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,827
[OBI] You compared the core
matter of two specimens,

12
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,620
Infernals A and B,

13
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,123
and found a difference
in their compositions.

14
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,332
Through chemical analysis,

15
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,084
you discovered the
DNA of a creature

16
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:27,754
that wasn't the victim
inside Infernal A's core.

17
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,300
And you think that this
DNA belonged to a bug.

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,886
I don't just think that,

19
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,056
it's the conclusion I reached
through careful research.

20
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,642
I've studied many other
Infernal cadavers,

21
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,270
and the specimens I suspected
of artificial ignition

22
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,814
all had the same
things in common.

23
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,566
Their cores had
been compromised,

24
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,525
pierced from without,

25
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,987
as if a creature had
forcefully made its way in.

26
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,657
[HIBANA]
An insect.

27
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,890
[SHINRA] It's been five days
since we joined the First.

28
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,933
[chuckles, snorts]

29
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:45,809
[snoring]

30
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,103
[SHINRA]
We'll be undercover for a month.

31
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,980
We have that long to
try and find a lead

32
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,108
on the source of these
artificial Infernals.

33
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,360
[grunts]

34
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,695
C'mon, Lieutenant Hinawa,

35
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,447
what're you doing
here this time?

36
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,781
Checking up on you.

37
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,076
Run into any problems yet?
Has Arthur been holding up okay?

38
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,036
I told you we were
doing fine yesterday,

39
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,789
do you have to come by
here every morning?

40
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,250
[giggles]

41
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,044
Goodness. If it isn't the
Lieutenant from the Eighth.

42
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,213
Morning. Good to see you.

43
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,673
[HINAWA]
Good morning.

44
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,259
He has a lotta concern
for his soldiers, huh?

45
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,635
[SISTER A]
Yeah, he really does.

46
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,805
Sir, to be honest, this
is getting embarrassing.

47
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,266
[HINAWA]
Hm? Don't really see why.

48
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,058
I wouldn't need to come

49
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,353
if you checked in
with the captain more.

50
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,606
Fine then, I'll do that.

51
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,692
Shoo! Shoo!

52
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:42,240
Oh, crap. Captain Hibana
came with him this time?

53
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,910
The two of us are openly
prowling their grounds

54
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,037
and they're completely
unperturbed.

55
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,955
I can say for a fact
that we'd never be

56
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,457
this open at Company Five.

57
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,919
We have too many of
Haijima's secrets to protect.

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,462
According to my investigation,

59
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,507
most artificial Infernals have
appeared at fire scenes,

60
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,969
or in secured zones that only
Fire Soldiers can enter.

61
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,055
Disturbing though it is,

62
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:09,351
it's likely that our culprit
is a Fire Soldier.

63
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,313
The bigger question is whether
they're a member of Company One.

64
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,572
So, tell me,

65
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,659
why'd you guys wanna become
Fire Soldiers, anyway?

66
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,829
You know, as a hero, I thought
I should protect mankind

67
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,081
from the Infernals and
human combustion.

68
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,791
It's only natural
that a brave knight

69
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,544
should fight on behalf
of the peasantry.

70
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,422
Dude. This job is
a chick magnet.

71
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,801
I joined 'cause I wanted
to impress the ladies.

72
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,053
You guys are so amazing.

73
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,223
I can barely control
my pyrokinesis at all.

74
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,141
Maybe it's 'cause I don't
have a sense of purpose

75
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,810
like you guys do.

76
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,229
You don't need some
grand objective.

77
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,981
As long as you end up
helping people out,

78
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,482
I think you've done enough.

79
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,652
Yeah. I suppose you're right.

80
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,113
Thank you, Shinra.
I feel better. Uh.

81
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,449
It's time for morning assembly!
So finish eating already!

82
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,327
All of you need to hurry back to
your appointed stations and‐‐

83
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,579
[gasps]

84
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,457
If you would excuse me,
ma'am, I need mayonnaise.

85
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,293
[SHINRA]
Whoa. Hey!

86
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,840
You're such a friggin' jerk!
Stay away from meow, will you?

87
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,676
I was just sitting still
and then you fell on me!

88
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,720
[bell ringing]

89
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,972
[SHINRA] Is that the morning
assembly bell?

90
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,267
That's the alarm! It means
an Infernal's appeared!

91
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,311
Juggernaut, find
Lieutenant Hoshimiya!

92
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,979
Kishiri, Lieutenant Li!

93
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:36,980
And you two from the Eighth

94
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,024
should report to
Lieutenant Flam!

95
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,293
[KARIM] This is another
mass combustion incident.

96
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,962
A total of five victims
have turned Infernal.

97
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,757
Nozaka Squad, get
civilians out of the area.

98
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,427
Matsuda Squad, spread out and
keep the rest of us informed.

99
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,804
The rest of us will search
for the Infernals.

100
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,723
Let's put them to rest quickly.

101
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,224
[FIRST MEMBERS]
Sir!

102
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,270
[SHINRA] Awesome. This Company's
a well‐oiled machine.

103
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,398
[KARIM]
You two stand by.

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442
Go to Matsuda Squad
if you see something.

105
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,944
Please let us help you, sir!

106
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,905
Throwing in new recruits
would only cause confusion.

107
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,408
The best thing you can do is
just stay right here, ya hear?

108
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,138
[SHINRA chuckles]

109
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,682
Hey, you all right?

110
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,687
[SHINRA]
Huh?

111
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,066
What happened?

112
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,862
[VICTIM A screams]

113
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,284
That's our culprit. After 'em!

114
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,787
Shouldn't we stop
the Infernal first?

115
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,417
No, we'll have to leave him
to Company One for now.

116
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,423
[SHINRA]
You'll pay for this.

117
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,051
Fire Soldiers are supposed
to protect people!

118
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,679
You can't run faster
than I can fly!

119
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,932
[gasps]

120
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,017
[REKKA]
Shinra!

121
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,476
[KARIM]
What are you doing?

122
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,354
I thought I ordered
you to stay behind.

123
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,152
Answer me: What are you
two doing back here?

124
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,445
Talk or‐‐ Uh!

125
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,991
We don't get to visit Shinjuku
much. We kinda got lost.

126
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:57,037
[ARTHUR groaning]

127
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,373
We finished, Lieutenant Rekka.

128
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,876
All the Infernals have
been laid to rest.

129
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,754
[REKKA]
Got it. Good work, Tamaki.

130
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,676
'Kay. Let's head back.

131
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,809
Shinra, why'd you stop me?

132
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,074
Someone's been making Infernals

133
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,826
and the Lieutenants are
our top suspects, right?

134
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,245
Yeah, but we can't tell
friend from foe here,

135
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,039
so we need to wait.

136
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,586
If we'd acted then, we might've
been silenced for good.

137
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,880
So what do you think
we should do now?

138
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,090
That man was killed.

139
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,967
I know. I saw it
with my own eyes.

140
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,844
He pressed a bottle
containing an insect

141
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,721
against that civilian's back.

142
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,014
And right after that...

143
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,058
The man turned Infernal.

144
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,810
It's pure evil.

145
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,646
How can a Fire Soldier
justify doing this?

146
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,357
Talked to a nun who was
passing by earlier.

147
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,610
Only the Lieutenants wear the
robes you saw on the culprit.

148
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,738
So we should start by
investigating Karim and Rekka.

149
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,782
You talk like that'll be simple,

150
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,742
but they're both
formidable foes.

151
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,119
How's that matter?

152
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,955
Strong or not, they should
be held accountable.

153
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,918
Let's start by searching
Karim's room.

154
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,169
[ARTHUR]
You sure he's not in it?

155
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,255
Yeah. I asked Juggernaut
to make somethin' up

156
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,298
and keep him occupied.

157
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,551
[ARTHUR] Did you tell
Juggernaut about our mission?

158
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:39,013
No need. He seems to have
taken a liking to Tamaki.

159
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,141
So when I said I could get
her phone number for him,

160
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,477
he volunteered to help us out,
no questions asked.

161
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,314
But anyway, why are you
wearing that get‐up?

162
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,649
[ARTHUR]
I made a job change.

163
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,734
Went from knight to assassin.

164
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,700
[SHINRA] So after all that
insufferable "knight" talk,

165
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,993
you're‐‐

166
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,619
Still a knight.

167
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,629
What was that?

168
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,673
I call this a mini Excalibur.

169
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,383
Make 'em from a
sheet of plastic,

170
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,178
which means they all tend
to melt after one use.

171
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,137
[SHINRA]
You idiot!

172
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,931
This'll make it obvious that
someone broke in here!

173
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,933
[ARTHUR]
You don't sound like yourself.

174
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,437
Guess you lost your nerve
after Burns kicked your ass.

175
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,688
What'd you say?

176
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,440
If the mystery of
human combustion

177
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,649
could be solved cleanly,

178
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,194
then someone would've
done it by now.

179
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,491
[SHINRA] I'd be surprised
to see you solve anything.

180
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,743
[ARTHUR chuckles]

181
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,430
[gasps]

182
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,973
That vial!

183
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,102
[ARTHUR] So one of these
can turn someone Infernal?

184
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,898
That settles it.
Karim Flam is our culprit.

185
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,525
[ARTHUR, SHINRA gasp]

186
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,446
I left that buggy little
bug there as bait

187
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,240
to lure the two of you out.

188
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,117
Your behavior in that back alley
was suspicious earlier,

189
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,286
so I thought I'd test you.

190
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,083
[KARIM] So the Eighth trailed
the same trail I'm trailing.

191
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,292
Interesting.

192
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,877
What're you getting at?

193
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,920
Those insects.

194
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,631
I wanna catch the louse
who's spreading them, too.

195
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,091
So we're on the same side, then.

196
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,385
How do we know we can trust you?

197
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,595
[KARIM] You saw the
culprit at work, right?

198
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,765
Judging from the fact that I'm
one of your first suspects,

199
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,434
they must've been
in robes like mine.

200
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,188
[KARIM]
It wasn't me.

201
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,983
And there was just one
solitary single person there

202
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,235
who wore robes like mine.

203
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,989
[SHINRA]
Rekka Hoshimiya.

204
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,617
[KARIM]
Had a case two months ago

205
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,537
where a large group of kids
caught fire all at once.

206
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,706
I knew it couldn't be natural.

207
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,251
And then I found the insect,
left behind at the scene.

208
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,837
So he was targeting children?

209
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,510
[CHILD C] I got a five star
from the gacha machine.

210
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,679
Whoa, for real? You're lucky.

211
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,180
[TAMAKI]
Hey there, kids.

212
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,181
[BOTH]
Hm?

213
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,517
Fires sure are scary, huh?

214
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,645
You heard about how those kids
your age burned up, right?

215
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,063
Well, listen,

216
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,317
there's a way to make sure
the flames can never get you.

217
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,280
I can show you if you
come with me, 'kay?

218
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,425
What're you trying to do, Rekka?

219
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,943
[TAMAKI]
'Kay! Let's go!

220
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,947
Tamaki, thanks for
rounding everyone up.

221
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,616
I've finally found
a sacred prayer

222
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,994
that can make people immune
to Infernalization!

223
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,789
If I can save these kids
from the fear of flames,

224
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,958
then I can die with
a smile on my face!

225
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,086
That's great, Lieutenant.

226
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,421
I only wish I could
save more right now.

227
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,257
I'm such a failure. Damn it all!

228
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,885
Father, is it really true?

229
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,679
Can you actually protect my
kids from becoming Infernals?

230
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,014
'Course I can!

231
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,767
You kept it secret, right?
Can't have any squabbling.

232
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,478
One of my friends from
school got burned up.

233
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,146
It was really sad.

234
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,523
I'm scared that I'll be next,

235
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,775
but you're saying you
can keep me safe, right?

236
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,985
You got it, bud!

237
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,070
Don't be scared!

238
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,989
Now that you're here with me,
everything's gonna be fine!

239
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,618
We'll get stronger so we can
never be beaten by the flames!

240
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,999
[REKKA] Tamaki, would you
mind stepping outside?

241
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,918
I'd like to focus on the prayer.

242
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,253
[TAMAKI]
Huh?

243
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,713
[REKKA] You've been a great
help. Thanks for everything.

244
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,258
I would do anything for
you, Lieutenant Rekka,

245
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,261
but I was hoping you might
let me see the prayer, too.

246
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,929
Just so I can keep helping.

247
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,640
[REKKA]
My stars!

248
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,350
Thank you, Tamaki!

249
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,146
It's okay. You're really
making too much of it.

250
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:43,234
[REKKA] No, I'm not. I'm so
grateful for you, Tamaki!

251
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:43,943
I‐‐

252
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,446
[REKKA]
You deserve a rest!

253
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,990
[ALL gasp]

254
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:53,786
Now then, all of you
have been chosen.

255
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,747
You're going to help me find
a host for the Pilot Light.

256
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,460
Please. We've changed
our minds. Let us go!

257
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,503
[REKKA] You wanna let
your children's futures

258
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,130
go up in smoke?

259
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,507
Sounds like you've
failed as a mother.

260
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,720
[gasps]

261
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,763
[CHILD B]
What's wrong, Mommy?

262
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,684
[MOTHER A roars]

263
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,812
Return to the great
flame of fire.

264
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,407
[ARTHUR] You're about to
go look for Rekka, right?

265
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,159
We're coming with you.

266
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,286
[KARIM]
Company One'll sort this out.

267
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,538
Outsiders like you
should stay out of it.

268
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,623
[SHINRA]
With respect, sir,

269
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,875
we're currently assigned
to Karim Squad.

270
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,294
Then consider this an
order from your Lieutenant.

271
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,712
Do not come with me.

272
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,089
As if we have to
take orders from you.

273
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,759
We're both with Company
Eight, remember?

274
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,683
So, you two are my squad
'cause you're serving under me,

275
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:02,396
but you aren't my squad
'cause you're not under me.

276
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,774
Feel free to feel free, then.

277
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,111
[CHILDREN crying, whimpering]

278
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,280
Well, that one's a no‐go.

279
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,365
But it won't be a problem

280
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,243
as long as one of
you kids can do it.

281
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,786
C'mon, stop crying!

282
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,372
You can't beat the flames
if you're this weak.

283
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,624
You've gotta act
strong to get strong.

284
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,417
That is what you want, right?

285
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,253
Yeah! Let's beat the flames!

286
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,755
[coughing]

287
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:34,887
[TAMAKI] Lieutenant Rekka?
What's going on here?

288
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,139
[REKKA] I wanted you to
live and take the blame,

289
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,058
but I guess I should'a
squeezed harder.

290
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,894
[TAMAKI]
Huh? What do you mean, sir?

291
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,437
[REKKA]
Don't sweat it, Tamaki.

292
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,772
You don't need to understand.

293
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,525
You just need to be
brave. Like these kids.

294
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,902
[TAMAKI]
No. This can't be real.

295
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:54,240
Don't tell me... You're the one
who's been making Infernals?

296
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,658
I adored you, Lieutenant.

297
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,202
There was no one I
believed in more than y‐‐

298
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,789
[REKKA]
You still adore me, don't you?

299
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,332
Or is your heart so lukewarm

300
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,252
that'cha let your feelings
change at the drop of a hat?

301
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,045
[REKKA screams]

302
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,672
[REKKA]
I refuse to surrender!

303
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:13,217
No matter how many innocent
children have to be sacrificed,

304
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,596
I will never give up,
understand?!

305
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,599
I will keep creating Infernals
for the Evangelist,

306
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,810
till I finally find someone
who can host the Pilot Light!

307
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,397
[screaming]

308
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,024
[TAMAKI]
You were always this awkward,

309
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,318
strangely hot‐blooded, guy.

310
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,570
I thought it was so cool
how driven you were

311
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,573
and how nothing got you down.

312
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,533
But now I'm finding
out that you're just

313
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,036
a hot‐blooded son of a bitch!

314
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,704
[REKKA]
My stars!

315
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,878
Lie there and be quiet
like a good little girl.

316
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,714
You‐‐ You're a‐‐

317
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,883
Okay. It's your turn now.

318
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,134
Put me down!

319
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,052
I don't wanna.

320
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,386
‐‐Oh, no! Tak‐kun!
‐‐Lemme go!

321
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,640
[REKKA]
Here goes, Tak‐kun. Get ready.

322
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,434
He's gonna burn!

323
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,226
[REKKA]
Tak‐kun!

324
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:09,231
[screaming]

325
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,284
What was that sound?

326
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,912
[screaming]

327
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,829
Hang in there!

328
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,041
I know that it burns,
but you can take it!

329
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,459
This is wrong.

330
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,919
[REKKA]
Don't give up, Tak‐kun!

331
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,297
Fight! Fight for your life!

332
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,757
[gasps]

333
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,813
He didn't turn Infernal.
How can that be?

334
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,610
This means that he's compatible.

335
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,071
At long last, I pulled it off!

336
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,782
I found a host
for the Pilot Light!

337
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,409
That's great,
but it doesn't mean

338
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,327
the rest of you
are off the hook.

339
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,747
So let's take on the Pilot Light
and earn victory for tomorrow!

340
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,999
[ALL gasp]

341
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,627
If you've got a fighting
spirit, you'll be fine.

342
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:16,674
Rev yourself up and win! Fire!

343
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,928
Please just... stop.
Let 'em go.

344
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,222
Someone...

345
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,599
Someone make him...

346
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,520
Somebody come and help us!

347
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,570
[REKKA]
What was that, Tamaki?

348
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,990
[REKKA] And you were
such an outstanding,

349
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,159
obedient subordinate!

350
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,999
What the hell's
gotten into you?!

351
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,667
There are children watching!

352
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,712
How can you let them
see you like this?!

353
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,338
They're giving this
everything they have,

354
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,174
and they're only kids!

355
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,342
I put my faith in you, Tamaki.

356
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,345
I believed you could
take the fall for me!

357
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,514
[TAMAKI]
I cared for you so much.

358
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,724
[REKKA]
I trusted you!

359
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,102
I trusted you and no one else!

360
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,438
Now I'll have to change
the plan and kill you.

361
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,356
[TAMAKI] The hot‐blooded,
gentle lieutenant...

362
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:18,861
[REKKA] I'll make it look like
you burned yourself to death!

363
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:22,531
Damn it. This is hard
for me, too, you know!

364
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,743
I didn't want it to go this way!

365
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,120
[yells]

366
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,415
[REKKA] Do you see how
my fist weeps for you?

367
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,875
I'll be right beside you

368
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,711
all the way to the
end, okay, Tamaki?!

369
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,464
You said you would
do anything for me...

370
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,882
...so die in my place!

371
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,050
[TAMAKI]
Somebody...

372
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,845
[TAMAKI] I looked up to you.
More than anyone.

373
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,597
Help me, please.

374
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,005
Hey, Tamaki.

375
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,507
You all right?

1
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,440
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

2
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,902
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

3
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,695
But out of that long,
morbid list,

4
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,324
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

5
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:47,923
[PEOPLE chattering]

6
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,182
Tamaya!

7
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,059
Kagiya!

8
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,103
[OBI]
It really is a festival.

9
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,356
This must be a way of mourning
that's unique to Asakusa.

10
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,568
It's different from most
proto‐nationalist funerals.

11
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,322
Let's get these
repairs started quickly.

12
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,198
[7TH CREWMEN]
Right!

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,576
If I destroyed your house
during Kantaro's send‐off,

14
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,036
you're welcome to stay
at the guardhouse.

15
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,038
We'll look after you
until it's been fixed.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,374
I don't think it'll
take too long.

17
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,128
Hey, Captain, would it
be all right with you

18
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,255
if I helped out with
repairs as well?

19
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,673
Good idea.

20
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,134
Doubt they'll talk to us while
they're dealing with this,

21
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,095
so we may as well help
speed things along.

22
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,278
[BENIMARU]
Huh? Hey!

23
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,030
[SHINRA]
Please let the Eighth help!

24
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:53,989
Thanks to my powers,

25
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,284
I can carry heavy loads
to high places no problem.

26
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,543
Let me get all this wreckage
outta the way for you.

27
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,091
You can leave the
welding work to me.

28
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,347
[7TH CREWMAN A]
Huh. Not bad.

29
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,681
Whoa.

30
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,437
[7TH CREWMEN gasp]

31
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,690
Think we'll have to get a
truck over here to move this.

32
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,281

00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,619

Aw, why?

[7TH CREWMEN yelling]

36
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,685
[MAN]
I saw Company Eight's Matchbox

37
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,521
parked on Yagen
Street in Asakusa.

38
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,817
Why would the Eighth be in
the Seventh's jurisdiction?

39
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,776
[ARROW]
When the Eighth moved

40
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,986
to investigate Company
One's jurisdiction,

41
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,446
it was because of Rekka.

42
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,699
They may have caught
our scent here.

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,952
What does the
Evangelist command?

44
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,578
[ARROW]
We failed to kill them before,

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,206
so we're to finish the job now.

46
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,502
[ARROW] Prepare the traps.
The bugs, too.

47
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,103
[7TH CREWMAN D]
Today's work is done!

48
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,314
[7TH CREWMAN E]
Call it a day and rest up!

49
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,238
You honestly don't
have to do this, Waka.

50
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,031
[BENIMARU] I do, the youngsters
have been out there

51
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,616
working their butts
off rebuilding,

52
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,785
so this is the least I can do.

53
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,620
Well, thank you.

54
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,996
[KONRO gasps]

55
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,373
Does that hurt?

56
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,584
I'm fine. The cold
just surprised me.

57
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,506
You know, Konro, honestly,
I still think you're the one

58
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,633
who should've become captain.

59
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,762
Well, I don't. Company Seven
is a bunch of rowdy thugs.

60
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,430
I can't fight anymore,

61
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,433
which means I'd never
make it as their captain.

62
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,478
[BOTH giggle]

63
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,729

[HIKAGE]
Waka!

00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,107
[SHINRA]
Hey, hold on!

66
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,192
Hello, girls. How goes it?

67
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,319
That damn twerp keeps
chasin' us around.

68
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,696
I think he's try'na eat us.

69
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,656
Yeah, it's pretty
friggin' screwed up.

70
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,575
[SHINRA] I was nice enough
to play tag with you

71
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,618
and this is my reward?

72
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,371
Didn't you like seeing
my spinning fire top?

73
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,123
Spinning fire top?

74
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,583
He shoots fire out of his feet,

75
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,334
and then he spins
around on his head!

76
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,669
It's really stupid.

77
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,588
[HINATA, HIKAGE]
Yay! Ha‐ha!

78
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,632
It's a cool dance move
called break‐dancing.

79
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,010
It's not stupid, it's
difficult and awesome.

80
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,179
Heh. Such a kid.

81
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,473
Thanks for the help.
I appreciate it.

82
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,435
I know what a handful these
runts can be, and you...

83
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,062
Call us runts again and
we'll smoosh you, Konro!

84
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,440
No sweat. I'm pretty good at
keeping children entertained.

85
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,441
[HINATA]
Treat us like kids again

86
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,443
and we'll smoosh you, Shinra!

87
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,532
Come on. I'll show you one
more spinning fire top.

00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,328
[HIKAGE] Shut up! Don't tell
us what to do, you punk!

00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,662
[HIKAGE yelps]

90
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,667
These Company Eight people,

91
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,086
they aren't a bad
bunch to be around.

92
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,588
I feel like they're
a different sort

93
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,632
than the other companies.

94
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,801
They remind me of us in a way.

95
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,346
I suppose so.

96
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,806
[KONRO] Why don't we help
with their investigation?

97
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,978
So is that what you would
do if you were our captain?

98
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,068
Waka, you weren't chosen
to be this company's captain

99
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,278
just because of your power.

100
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,448
Do you know why Company Eight
chose to help us today? 'Cause‐‐

101
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,035
Just give it a rest. I've heard
you say all this before.

102
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,372
Sorry, but I'm not cut
out for this crap.

103
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,041
I never should have
been made a leader.

104
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,879
Face forward, will ya, Konro?

105
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,007
I can't wrap your
bandage like this.

106
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,676
Think we will help 'em.

107
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,845
Company Eight is pretty
all right in my book.

108
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,438

Ah! Waka!

109
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,232
Sorry about the intrusion, sir.

110
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,193
That? There's no
need to sweat it.

111
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,991
So, hey, about
Lieutenant Konro's body.

112
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,909
[BENIMARU] When a third
generation continues

113
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,370
to use their powers
after overheating,

114
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:20,500
their body starts to incinerate,
and their flesh becomes ash.

115
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,796
Tephrosis. This the first
you've heard of it?

116
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,881
They taught us about
it at the Academy.

117
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,801
Never saw it though.
Not in person.

118
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,970
When it happened, I...

119
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,476
[BENIMARU]
Shinra, I'd like to have

120
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520
a few words with your captain.

121
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,688
Is he around?

122
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,357
Oh. Right. That's actually
why I came here.

123
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,526
Captain Obi sent me to
ask if you'd meet him.

124
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,155
He's across the way, over in
that back alley by the river.

125
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,117
[BOTH]
Yay!

126
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,037
What're you gonna do now?
The Eighth stayin' in town?

127
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,204
As long as you're around,

128
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,706
you could always stay with
us here at the station.

129
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,666
It's not something
we were planning on,

130
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,793
but since we helped
with all those repairs,

131
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,378
our relationship with
Company Seven

132
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,921
has improved quite a bit.

133
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,632
Quick question, Missy.
You wanna strip for us again?

134
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,676
That's not gonna happen!

135
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,597
Hopefully, they'll allow us
to start our investigation now.

136
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,431
Oh, yeah.

137
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,725
I was just with Captain
Shinmon, and last I saw,

138
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,894
he was heading off
to meet with Obi.

139
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,146
Think they'll end up
working something out.

140
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,648
We haven't found anything
but breadcrumbs yet.

141
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,193
But we're on the
White‐Clads' trail.

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,283
I know we had to leave her

143
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,243
'cause of all the
proto‐nationalists,

144
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,662
but I feel weird
without Iris around.

145
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,998
And I'm glad the Fifth's
holding things down for us,

146
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,918
but we need to start
this investigation ASAP.

147
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,463
The sooner we can get this
mess figured out, the better.

148
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,216
Hurry up and get
rid of all this.

149
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,593
We need to clear more space
for Shinra's new desk.

150
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,553
You can toss Obi's junk outside.

151
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,223
Uh. Hey, could you not?

152
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,434
Apologies, Captain,
but why are we doing all this?

153
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,227
[HIBANA]
They need to learn

154
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,562
not to boss Company Five around.

155
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,232
Shouldn't you have just
told them "no" then?

156
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,401
<i>LÃ¡tom.</i>

157
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,071
Where does a worthless,
lowly piece of gravel like you

158
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,531
get off telling me
what I should do?

159
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,407
Yes, I'm nothing
but a lump of gravel.

160
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,867
Punish me till you're satisfied!

161
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:22,205
Owie! Owie! Oh!
Stomp even harder, please!

162
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,087
[OBI]
That went well, don't you think?

163
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:29,671
[BENIMARU]
Hm?

164
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,713
[HINAWA]
Yes, it did.

165
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,049
[OBI] We turned that
Kantaro guy Infernal,

166
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,509
and they're none the wiser.

167
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,010
[HINAWA]
That's true.

168
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,387
Let's turn as many
of these people

169
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,264
as we can into Infernals.

170
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,515
Agreed.

00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,312
[SHINRA]
Maki!

174
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,106
We need to assess the situation.

175
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,899
Let's try to avoid
doing anything rash

176
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,402
until we've met up
with Captain Obi.

177
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,280
[OBI]
What's going on here?

178
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,614
Why is he attacking us?

179
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,577
[HINAWA] I told you not to eat
Company Seven's <i>daifuku</i>!

180
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,289
[growls] I only had one of them,
though. He's overreacting!

181
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,127
You're dead.

182
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,837
[OBI]
What did we do?

183
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,422
[BENIMARU]
Shut up!

184
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,257
No chance in hell are
you talking your way

185
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,093
out of this one.

186
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,513
You're the ones who turned
Kantaro into an Infernal.

187
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,556
[OBI]
Hm?

188
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,352
[OBI] Wait a second,
you think that was us?

189
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,564
Captain Shinmon, what
are you talking about?

190
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,609
No point playing dumb.
I saw you and heard you.

191
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,069
I know you plan to
bury my town in ash,

192
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,113
but you screwed up big time.

193
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,283
Because now that I know,
you've got no chance!

194
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,537
I don't know what you saw, sir,

195
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,456
but please calm down
so we can talk.

196
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,791
Screw that. There's
nothing to say.

197
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,420
Your Evangelist is made up.
My real enemy's here.

198
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,172
I saw your captain
and lieutenant

199
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,050
plotting to turn the people
of this town into Infernals.

200
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,968
And I will make them pay!

201
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,220
You're making a mistake!

202
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,933
I'll beat all of you to a pulp,
and then hang you out to dry.

203
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:09,437
[BENIMARU] I know exactly what
I saw. It was definitely them.

204
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,774
Captain, doesn't sound
like he's messing around.

205
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,942
Wait a minute, please!

206
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,402
We didn't come out here
to start a fight.

207
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,529
[BENIMARU] If that's the
story you're sticking to,

208
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,615
then beat me and
prove you're innocent.

209
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,117
Might makes right around here!

210
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,078
If you didn't wanna
start this fight,

211
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,622
then prove your point
by ending it.

212
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,792
You'd best get ready,
Company Eight.

213
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,003
You're about to face
Shinmon Benimaru.

214
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,797
Looks like we managed
to provoke him.

215
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,756
Yeah.

216
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,259
Then let's move
forward as planned.

217
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,555
Hinawa!

218
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,224
Leave it to me, sir.

219
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,896
Waka! The musclebound
idiot's running away!

220
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,608
[BENIMARU] Hiding behind
women and children now?

221
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,152
Guess he's a murderer
and a coward!

222
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,904
Everyone, stay back!

223
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,324
I'm a Fire Soldier
just like you.

224
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,243
Don't look down on me.

225
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,036
Ya think you blocked that?

226
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,790
Maki!

227
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,589
[MAKI screams]

228
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,093
[gunshots]

229
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,389
[BENIMARU] Fire that
peashooter all you want,

230
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,598
you'll never hit me.

231
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,559
[HINAWA] I wasn't
really expecting to.

232
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,396
That said, I'd like to see what
limits your strength might have.

233
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,150
Can you wield your second‐ and
third‐gen powers in tandem?

234
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,235
Let's find out! Get him!

235
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,413
[TAMAKI yells]

236
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,334
[ARTHUR yells]

237
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,721
You guys are finished.
Iai Chop, Form One...

238
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,139
...Fire Moon.

239
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,402
Is that the best
your company's got?

240
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,489
[BOTH gasp]

241
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,534
[footstep]

242
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,454
[BENIMARU]
Hm?

243
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,749
When you go after my
soldiers, you answer to me.

244
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,709
He was just suiting up?

245
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:41,089
[OBI] Let's settle this‐‐
captain to captain.

246
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,191
Why the hell would you turn an
innocent man into an Infernal?

247
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,693
[OBI] You won't listen
to a word I have to say.

248
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,613
So you may as well
shut up and bring it on!

249
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,200
[BENIMARU] You finally ready
to drop the act, you scum?

250
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,081
[BENIMARU]
Hm?

251
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,874
You're not putting
out my flames.

252
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,126
[OBI]
Put them out?

253
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,920
I'd love to if that
were possible...

254
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,464
...but I don't have any powers.

255
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,966
[BENIMARU]
You're kidding.

256
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,972
Then shouldn't you be
afraid of all this fire?

257
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,058
[OBI]
Damn right I am. It burns!

258
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,732
[BENIMARU] If you know how
terrifying flames can be,

259
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,025
then how could you
bring yourself

260
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,361
to turn Kantaro infernal?

261
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,199
[OBI] I'm telling you, there's
been some kind of mistake!

262
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,076
[BENIMARU]
There was no mistake.

263
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,495
I know what I saw!

264
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,997
Captain, no!

265
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,254
[OBI] I don't care if you're
second gen, third gen, or both.

266
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,175
I train every single day.

267
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,177
An extinguisher grenade?

268
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,651
[gasps]

269
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,908
[BENIMARU]
You gassed yourself, too?

270
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,589
[OBI]
And let that be a lesson to ya.

271
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,550
It's almost like you
don't know how to flinch.

272
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,763
I can't afford to
flinch right now.

273
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,098
Not when I'm carrying the
weight of Company Eight

274
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,017
on my shoulders.

275
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,103
What's the deal with
that muscle guy?

276
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,480
He doesn't have powers.

277
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,482
Then how did he
manage to hit Waka?

278
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,777
How did he do that? The
captain's really that strong?

279
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,613
Did you think he was a pushover?

280
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,617
That said, strong or not,
he shouldn't act so recklessly.

281
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,704
Captains Obi and Shinmon are
both charismatic figures.

282
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,457
Whatever paths they take,
others will follow.

283
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,627
We can't allow this fight
to continue for much longer.

284
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,712
Is there a way we
can make them stop?

285
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,839
It seems as though beating
him is the only way

286
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,258
to set the record straight.

287
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,217
Waka!

288
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,553
Let him have it!

289
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,721
What's all this
commotion about?

290
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,557
Apparently these Eighth
people are the ones

291
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,350
who turned Kantaro infernal.

292
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,352
Waka snapped and
started a fight!

293
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,145
[BOTH]
Munch!

294
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,732
That can't be right.
It's too absurd.

295
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,987
None of these things
you do add up.

296
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,281
When'll you start making sense?

297
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,370
So you won't go down to anything
less than my best stuff.

298
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,371
[grunts]

299
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,873
Guess I'll stop playing then.

300
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,918
What is he doing now?

301
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,211
[KONRO]
No!

302
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:13,634
Here goes. Iai Chop,
Form Seven: Sun Wheel.

303
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,136
Waka, hold on!

304
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,138
Don't try to stop me.

305
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,973
These people aren't
what they seem.

306
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,349
They turned Kantaro infernal

307
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,185
and they wanna do the same with
everyone else in this town.

308
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,895
What makes you think that?

309
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,606
I saw this one
and his lieutenant

310
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,773
plotting the whole thing out.

311
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:32,153
How many times do I have to tell
you that you've made a mistake?!

312
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,821
Enough talk.

313
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,866
Let me do this, Konro.

314
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,368
No. You need to calm down.

315
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,411
What's the matter with you?

316
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,289
Why are you using
your pyrokinesis?

317
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,291
[KONRO groaning]

318
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,960
Hinata! Hikage! Bring
me a cooling blanket!

319
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:48,711
Can do!

320
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,671
We're on the job!

321
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,798
Waka, as a favor to me,

322
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,843
would you at least hear out
what they have to say?

323
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,888
[sighs]

324
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,606
Okay.

325
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:12,193
When Waka thinks he saw you,
where were you two actually?

326
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,153
The captain and I
were both at the store

327
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,615
stocking up on a few essential
supplies that we'd run short on.

328
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,034
We informed Fire Soldier
Maki before we left.

329
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,452
Yeah. They told me.

330
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,789
Hold on. He didn't mention
anything about the store to me.

331
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,666
He told me to go and
ask Captain Shinmon

332
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,793
to meet him and the
lieutenant in that alley.

333
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,544
[BENIMARU]
That's right you did.

334
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,672
I agreed and then
headed Obi's way.

335
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,341
Only I don't remember
ever saying that.

336
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,594
The hell is this?
Tryin' to fool him, too?

337
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,305
I'll ask the store
clerk to confirm this.

338
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,726
[BENIMARU]
For Konro's sake,

339
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,436
I'm delaying your judgment.

340
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,105
Try to leave before
I say you can

341
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,107
and there will be violence.

342
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,738
Sorry about him.

343
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,491
Waka's always been
a stubborn one.

344
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,327
That's just as true now
as it's ever been.

345
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,666
Lieutenant Konro, not to pry,

346
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,544
but how did you
end up like this?

347
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,340
Bottom line, I wasn't
strong enough.

348
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,301
Was Captain Shinmon with you?

349
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,680
He seemed to have
regrets about it.

350
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,849
[KONRO]
None of this was his fault.

351
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,476
Waka didn't do anything wrong.

352
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,690
[KONRO]
I'll just tell you.

353
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,442
This was a while back,

354
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,737
before we were recognized
as a Fire Force Company.

355
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,954
‐‐[PEOPLE screaming]

356
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,290
[7TH CREWMAN I]
Everyone run to the river!

357
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,047
What the hell's going on?

358
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,799
How can this many
people have turned?

359
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,010
Why're they all going
Infernal tonight?

360
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,344
I'm as confused as you are.

361
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,723
Let's just focus on
evacuation for now.

362
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,349
Where's the Fire Force?

363
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,852
Don't you think they should've
gotten here a while ago?

364
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:14,273
Yeah, but we can't rely on them.
We'll do this ourselves.

365
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,400
[BENIMARU groaning]

366
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,359
[KONRO]
Beni!

367
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,780
[BENIMARU]
Damn it. I can't breathe.

368
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,617
Hard as I try, I just can't
seem to get any oxygen in.

369
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,368
[KONRO] You're at your
pyrokinetic limit.

370
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,829
Stay here. I'll be back.

371
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,080
Not a chance, dumbass.

372
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,583
We both know you're in
the same boat as me.

373
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,753
[BENIMARU]
What?

374
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,556
[KONRO]
What is that thing?

375
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,268
[KONRO]
A demon!

376
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,898
[DEMON INFERNAL roars]

377
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,154
[KONRO] That Infernal...
it isn't like the others.

378
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,907
[KONRO]
Damn it.

379
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,244
[BENIMARU]
What are you doing?

380
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,829
Konro!

381
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,040
I'm sorry,

382
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,876
but with a rambunctious
little brat like you,

383
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,921
there was no other way
to get you to sit still.

384
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,508
[KONRO]
It's too soon, Beni.

385
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,427
I can't let your
fire go out yet.

386
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,606
[KONRO]
Rest up. I'll deal with this.

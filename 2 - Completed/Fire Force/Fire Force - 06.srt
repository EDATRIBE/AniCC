1
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,731
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

2
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,193
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

3
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,986
But out of that
long, morbid list,

4
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,657
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

5
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,386
Anybody home?

6
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,183
[SHINRA] This'll be a good
chance for me to see

7
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,436
how far I can go against
a company captain.

8
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,650
That said, I've got no chance

9
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,735
if I can't deal with
that weird power.

10
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,070
It ends for you here.

11
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:10,988
[SHINRA]
Huh?

12
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,615
[ANGELS]
'Cause the Fifth Angels Three...

13
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,659
...have come for thee!

14
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:06,520
[NUNS groaning]

15
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,907
[HIBANA]
All right, Iris.

16
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:23,662
Be a good girl and watch your
allies from the Eighth burn.

17
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,163
[IRIS]
Why are you doing this?

18
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,249
Maybe you should ask
that god of salvation

19
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,709
you're still pledged to.

20
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,253
There are just two ways
you can live in this world.

21
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,923
You can burn others
or you can be burnt.

22
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,717
Think of all our Sisters.

23
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:40,762
The way their bodies shriveled
as the flames consumed them.

24
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:47,018
[NUNS groaning]

25
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,988
It certainly is lucky that I'm
a third‐generation pyrokinetic.

26
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,282
I'll never be consumed
by cruel flames

27
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,826
because I decided to
become like them instead.

28
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,662
I'll give purpose to the
worthless gravel beneath me

29
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,415
by burning it to fuel
my rise to the top.

30
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,959
Because that's what
true happiness is.

31
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,502
Whatever you gain
from living like that

32
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,171
could never be called happiness!

33
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,465
Spout those empty
platitudes all you want.

34
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,051
You're just waiting
to burn. Ignorant fool!

35
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,678
[SHINRA]
Get away from the Sister.

36
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,929
[gasps]

37
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,434
You've got a hero to fight.

38
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,395
[HIBANA] He'll be the first
of your friends I burn.

39
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,897
Sit tight and watch.

40
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,398
You have to run, Shinra!

41
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,985
As strong as you are, you still
can't defeat Captain Hibana!

42
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,489
[SHINRA]
It's all right. I'll be fine.

43
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,826
This won't go like it
did the last time.

44
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,077
You fool.

45
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,163
It seems you have
a short memory.

46
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,581
A hunk of gravel like you

47
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,833
doesn't stand a chance
of harming me.

48
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,503
There's no way to
know until I try.

49
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,759
Shinra, no!

50
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:05,472
You really must be gravel.
So eager to lie beneath my feet.

51
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,517
My head's spinning. Damn.

52
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,311
Ah!

53
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,105
What have you... done to me?

54
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,899
It's called heat syncope.

55
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,360
[SHINRA]
What's that mean?

56
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,194
Simple.

57
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,570
Your body has been enveloped

58
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,406
by a miniature heatwave
created by me.

59
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,616
[SHINRA]
Huh?

60
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,785
[HIBANA] This causes your
blood vessels to dilate

61
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,370
and your blood pressure to drop,

62
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,248
which means less blood
flow to your poor brain.

63
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,376
And that causes vertigo.

64
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,379
After storming in here and
dubbing yourself a hero,

65
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,298
you ended up getting taken
out by a bit of heat.

66
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,300
It's quite amusing.

67
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,474
Vertigo?

68
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,852
That's all it is?

69
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:56,398
I see now. You're sayin' this
is all in my head, right?

70
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,649
[HIBANA]
Huh?

71
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,237
What do you mean,
"all in your head"?

72
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,991
Look at yourself,
you can barely even stand.

73
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,201
I feel short of breath,
dizzy, and weak,

74
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,829
but now I realize
it's only a delusion.

75
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,790
Looks like you're just
trying to grin and bear it.

76
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,084
But if you'd like to talk
about yourself and delusions,

77
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,003
why don't we start with
the ridiculous idea

78
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,671
that you're a hero?

79
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,636
Let's think this over.

80
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,806
I'm dizzy in my head,
so I'm dizzy for real.

81
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,560
Well, hey, guess what?
I'm a hero in my head, too!

82
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,854
[HIBANA]
This is absurd.

83
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,856
How are you even standing?

84
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:38,857
[SHINRA]
Compared to the drills

85
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,692
Lieutenant Hinawa
put me through,

86
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,903
this is a stroll
through the park.

87
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,823
Fine, then.

88
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,576
There's no sport in burning a
man who can't defend himself.

89
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,661
Come forth, Clematis.

90
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,707
I shall grant you a beautiful
death by my flowers.

91
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,918
Sister, after all
this time, you‐‐

92
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,794
Just shut your mouth and watch.

93
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,546
[gasps]

94
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,797
But‐‐

95
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,970
[SHINRA]
I might be wrong,

96
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,140
but I think you're the
who's delusional, Princess.

97
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,683
[HIBANA]
Say what?

98
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,062
[SHINRA] Don't worry.
It's your lucky day.

99
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,691
'Cause Smack‐that‐Princess‐to‐
Her‐Senses‐Man is here for ya!

100
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,569
And what delusion are you
planning to save me from?

101
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,406
Not sure, but you look
like you're in pain.

102
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,535
You know nothing about me!

103
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,084
[chuckles]

104
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,515
[HIBANA] So your dizziness
is all in your head, is it?

105
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,475
I think we'd find that
a lot more convincing

106
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,395
if you'd stop falling
all over yourself!

107
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,399
Damn it!

108
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,901
Honestly, how can you
call yourself a hero?

109
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,987
If you must close
your eyes to reality,

110
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,906
then I guess I'll have
to burn off your eyelids.

111
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,124
Sakura!

112
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,185
[HIBANA] That's a funny
dance you're doing.

113
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,979
Don't you enjoy
the flower petals?

114
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,897
Sister, you have to stop this!

115
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,941
You could ask your
God to make me stop.

116
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,067
Oh, wait.

117
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,154
Could it be that you've
realized your God isn't real?

118
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,823
And for the record,
neither are heroes.

119
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,575
No, that isn't true.

120
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,120
If you pray with all your heart,
you can find real comfort.

121
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,080
There are people who
have been saved by it!

122
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,916
[HIBANA] You know damn well
that isn't real salvation.

123
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,585
[IRIS]
Then are you saying that there's

124
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,295
no such thing as salvation?

125
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,464
[HIBANA]
Sure there is.

126
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,258
You outsmart others and exploit
them to your own ends

127
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,510
until you've risen so high
that when you look down

128
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,639
at the foolish masses below,
you see nothing but gravel.

129
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,893
Gravel. Impotent gravel.

130
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,062
And then, safe in the knowledge

131
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,523
that you're better than
the riff‐raff, you smile.

132
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,442
The only salvation
I need comes from

133
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,861
the wealth and status
I gain with power.

134
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,029
How so?

135
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,324
You prayed with us every day
back at the convent, remember?

136
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:38,244
All of us prayed. And what
did we get as our reward?

137
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:44,084
[bell tolling]

138
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,629
[HIBANA] The convent was
a refuge for us orphans.

139
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,804
[HIBANA] We were taught to
devote ourselves to God.

140
00:09:55,845 --> 00:10:00,350
I was probably the only one who
didn't take it all seriously.

141
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,561
And then, that day...

142
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:08,191
[NUNS groaning]

143
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,027
[HIBANA] The other Sisters
started burning away.

144
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,865
Every last one of them,
except you and me.

145
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,367
They were all devout nuns,

146
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,121
who served God far better
than I ever cared to.

147
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:26,084
Don't you see? Kind‐hearted
devotion never pays.

148
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,295
The fact that I'm still alive
while those nuns are dead

149
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,465
proves that more than anything.

150
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,510
You can only get stronger
by pursuing selfish gain.

151
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,303
And if you're hoping
to find salvation

152
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,847
without getting stronger,

153
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,808
why, you may as well
ask God for the moon.

154
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,146
[HIBANA] Salvation is
reserved for humans.

155
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,482
So by what right does
gravel hope to claim it?

156
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,236
[SHINRA]
Princess Hibana.

157
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,364
You're a victim of
the flames, too, right?

158
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,951
[HIBANA] Our cardboard
hero, standing again.

159
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:05,415
I know how you feel,
at least a little bit.

160
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:09,627
All the sweetest things in my
life went up in flames as well.

161
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,380
[HIBANA]
You'll never know how I feel.

162
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,092
[HIBANA]
Sakura Blizzard.

163
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,974
[screaming]

164
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,853
This time, I'll make you stay
down like the gravel you are!

165
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,364
[SHINRA]
You will never keep me down.

166
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,368
But the heat syncope.

167
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,746
[SHINRA] I'll get up
as often as it takes.

168
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,207
Convinced I can win every time.

169
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,167
'Cause I have to help you.

170
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,254
Huh? Have you lost your mind?

171
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,714
What're you talking about?

172
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,800
[SHINRA] Listen,
I'm about to lay you out.

173
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,429
And that, along with
the rest of this...

174
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,223
...is for your own good!

175
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,394
Well, if all you want
is what's best for me,

176
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,438
then go ahead and burn already!

177
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,191
Lie down and let the flames
do what they do best!

178
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,361
Fire does more than burn people.

179
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,154
It offers us warmth
when we're freezing,

180
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,740
and when we're surrounded by
darkness, it lights the way.

181
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,827
There's no such thing as a
hero in this wretched world!

182
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,622
[SHINRA] It might be true
that there aren't any yet...

183
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,418
...but that's all the more
reason for me to become one!

184
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,338
You're gonna be okay.

185
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:41,469
Or else my name isn't... Smack‐
that‐Princess‐to‐Her‐Senses Man!

186
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,154
[NUNS gasping, chattering]

187
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,990
[SISTER A]
Look at that one!

188
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,328
Wow, all of them are so pretty.

189
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,706
That's really amazing,
Sister Hibana.

190
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,666
[HIBANA]
Heh! Thanks, Sister Clematis.

191
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,417
Look here.

192
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,544
[NUNS gasp]

193
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,630
If I put a droplet of sodium
solution onto one of them,

194
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,881
the flame will react.

195
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,049
Watch.

196
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,930
Wow. It looks so cool!

197
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,849
This one is copper.

198
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,691
[HIBANA] Sister Sakura,
this one's for you.

199
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,735
It's calcium this time.

200
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,659
[HIBANA] I also have potassium,
strontium, and a few others.

201
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,708
They're all so
wonderful to look at.

202
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,628
I know. Flames are incredibly
beautiful, don't you think?

203
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,338
[SISTER CLEMATIS]
Uh‐huh!

204
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,591
[SISTER SAKURA] Sister Hibana,
I wanna be like you someday.

205
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,053
You can make fire, plus
you're good at science stuff.

206
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,766
[gasps]

207
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,273
Hello, Iris!

208
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:21,277
Don't hide behind the corner.
Come out and have a closer look.

209
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,744
[gasps]

210
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,084
‐‐Oh, uh.
‐‐Careful.

211
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,794
They might be in
the shape of flowers,

212
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,670
but each is a burning flame.

213
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,339
They can hurt you.

214
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,218
[SISTER SUMIRE]
My goodness!

215
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,178
What's going on here,
Sister Hibana?

216
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,264
Are you playing with
your fire again?

217
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,018
Come along now, everyone.
Back to the chapel, all right?

218
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,356
[NUNS]
Okay. Thank you, Sister Sumire.

219
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,483
[SISTER SUMIRE]
As for you, Sister Hibana.

220
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,485
Your power is a gift
from the great Sol‐‐

221
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,445
it's not meant
to be played with.

222
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,323
What's more, if you were to
wield these flames carelessly,

223
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,242
they could become
very dangerous.

224
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,660
But I'm being very
careful with them,

225
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,203
so it shouldn't be an issue.

226
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,123
[SISTER SUMIRE] And there
you go, arguing again.

227
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,917
Back to the chapel with you.

228
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,710
[HIBANA]
Fine.

229
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,763
Sorry.

230
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:35,768
But, Sister Hibana? I, um...

231
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,812
You okay?

232
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,566
[IRIS]
It's just‐‐ Well, uh.

233
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:51,325
I'd, um... I'd like to see
those flowers again.

234
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,869
Pretty please.

235
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,502
Sure, I'll show them to you once
you get over your shyness, okay?

236
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,923
Wait, do you really mean it?

237
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,353
[HIBANA]
The smell of burning bodies.

238
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,482
The inhuman screams
of the dying.

239
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:28,154
Searing pain. Anguish.
Lives crumbling to ash.

240
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,240
[HIBANA] Flames are incredibly
beautiful, don't you think?

241
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,500
[HIBANA] As if something like
fire could ever be pretty.

242
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,964
Let's go.

243
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,552
If we don't, then we'll
only burn up beside them.

244
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,362
As if a power like mine
could've come from God.

245
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:13,574
Fire comes from hell itself,
so if I wield it,

246
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,993
I know what that makes me.

247
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,121
And a devil should
act like a devil.

248
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,333
[IRIS]
Hey, wait.

249
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,752
Where are you going, Sister?

250
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,089
[HIBANA]
Away.

251
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,470
[HIBANA] Don't let
yourself be burnt, Iris.

252
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,477
[HIBANA]
People. Flames.

253
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,397
Whatever I find, I'll exploit.

254
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,654
[HIBANA] That's just a
taste of my findings.

255
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,740
Meet my conditions
and you get the rest.

256
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,784
First, I want the
rank of captain.

257
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,703
Furthermore, I want
funding and a lab

258
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,706
from which I can carry
on my experiments.

259
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,637
Why do all this?

260
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,517
We children at the convent
didn't have any parents.

261
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,811
But we did have our big sister.

262
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:28,733
She was beautiful and clever,
and she had mastered fire.

263
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,485
And when I was lonely
but too scared to speak,

264
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,738
my hero called to me.

265
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,119
I didn't have anyone
like that, though.

266
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,456
All I had to prop myself
up were my flames,

267
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,709
and then I found out they
couldn't be trusted, either.

268
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,347
[HIBANA]
I don't have anything left now.

269
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,982
If ya want a hero,
there's one right here.

270
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,446
Just look to the skies
and cry out my name!

271
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,074
I'll come and save you anytime!

272
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,952
But that's ridiculous.

273
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,871
You're under no obligation
to help me at all,

274
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,374
especially not after
what I've done.

275
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,001
But I don't have to be obliged.

276
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,545
If you say you need me,
I come running.

277
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,714
'Cause that's what heroes do.

278
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,807
Whatever the case,
you defeated me.

279
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,976
So I don't intend to
fight you any longer.

280
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,145
[IRIS]
Mh‐hm. Mh‐hm.

281
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:55,945
What do you think? Did I
overcome my shyness a bit?

282
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,949
How is that even a question now?

283
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,494
I can't believe you waltzed
into my base all by yourself.

284
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,583
Of course I did. I wanted
to see your flowers again.

285
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,086
They're pretty.

286
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,131
I did make you a
promise, didn't I?

287
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,222
They're irises.

288
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,434
Yeah. How do you like them?

289
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,313
[IRIS]
I love you, Sister!

290
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,539
[gunshots]

291
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,251
[CREWMAN groaning]

292
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,671
[CREWMAN A] The guy in
glasses, he's a monster!

293
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,005
Looks like the Eighth Company

294
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,466
has more or less
completely routed us.

295
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,969
[SHINRA, IRIS]
Must've been the Lieutenant.

296
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,845
[HIBANA sighs]

297
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,139
[HIBANA] How am I gonna explain
this mess to the higher‐ups?

298
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,351
For that matter, what should
I tell this spilt gravel?

299
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,270
Think Captain Obi had a plan.

300
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,438
He was gonna try and set
everything up to look like

301
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,899
a nocturnal joint
training exercise.

302
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,317
But you flew in before he could

303
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,278
lay the groundwork
for that, right?

304
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,821
If you keep charging
ahead like that,

305
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,282
you're bound to screw
up eventually.

306
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,702
I think I've come up
with a good solution.

307
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,246
What if we smooth things over
with a fun little dinner party

308
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,039
between the Fifth and
Eighth Companies?

309
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,375
[SHINRA]
That seems a bit outlandish.

310
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,461
[HIBANA]
And yet, it just might work.

311
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,255
[SHINRA]
Uh. Huh?

312
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,465
There are times when
the most ridiculous ruses

313
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,719
are the ones people are
least likely to suspect.

314
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,262
I can tell everybody
that to test

315
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,930
the fighting strength
of Company Five,

316
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,765
I planned a surprise
attack drill,

317
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,560
asking Company Eight
to play the bad guys.

318
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,563
Shinra, would you mind rounding
up the rest of the Eighth

319
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,524
and filling them in
on the new situation?

320
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,444
You sure are being
cooperative now.

321
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,115
Well, yeah.

322
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,160
That's because I've
taken a liking to you.

323
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,328
[SHINRA]
Uh.

324
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,495
[grunts]

325
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,627
[OBI] Chief, I know
it's ahead of schedule,

326
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,212
but we've begun our
investigation of the Fifth.

327
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,672
There might be violence,

328
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,133
so make what
preparations you can.

329
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,566
Hinawa, you read me?

330
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,275
That's right.

331
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,152
Took time to set things up,

332
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,322
but I'm ready to give
you some backup.

333
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,658
Huh?

334
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,117
It's over?

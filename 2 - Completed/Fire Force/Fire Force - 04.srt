since the murders.

aggression out on us like this.

Hi‐ho, Silver!

177
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,280
No way. Are you
serious right now?

178
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,240
What's wrong with you?

179
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,908
Oh, whatever.

180
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,966
Oh, hey. It's you two.

181
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,844
Wait, this is a public road.
You shouldn't fly here.

182
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:18,428
Yeah.

183
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,765
I'll move higher soon, but could
you tell me about that Infernal?

184
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,184
[HINAWA]
It was a murder defendant.

185
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,811
He was being tried at
Ueno District Court.

186
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,189
He's attacking
bystanders as we speak.

187
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,900
You two hurry ahead and
help out at the scene, okay?

188
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,817
Yes, sir!

189
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,904
Saving lives should
be your top priority!

190
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,488
Understood!

191
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,423
[whimpering]

192
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,050
[LAWYER A]
I'm your lawyer, remember?!

193
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,261
I've been on your
side all this time!

194
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,431
"It's dangerous.
Civilians should evacuate."

195
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:07,435
I used to say that all
the time as a firefighter.

196
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,519
It was my pleasure,

197
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,855
saving you from that
sickening courthouse.

198
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,649
You could say I saved your life,

199
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,235
which would mean your
life belongs to me now.

200
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,736
[LAWYER A whimpers]

201
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,447
And if your life belongs to me,

202
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,117
then I get to do whatever
I want to with it, right?

203
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,870
[SHINRA]
Let go!

204
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,538
God save me.

205
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,751
What the hell's your‐‐?

206
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,589
[MIYAMOTO]
What the hell?

207
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,428
What the hell's your
problem, ya crazy punks?

208
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,847
Our mascot friend Mamoru
got hip‐hip‐hoorayed

209
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,349
into a tree because of you!

210
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,976
Yeah, right!

211
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,519
Wait, that's your beef?

212
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,146
[MIYAMOTO] You're Special
Fire Soldiers, right?

213
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,648
So when you murder someone,

214
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,234
you get praised for
"saving the day."

215
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,444
Must be nice.

216
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,366
Good, we made it in time.

217
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,160
Sputter Comet!

218
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,539
Sputter Comet, I'm so sorry.

219
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,749
[OBI]
How can he still speak?

220
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,543
He's fully transformed.

221
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,212
When someone has a strong
will and attachment to life,

222
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,132
some of their traits
can survive the change.

223
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,759
I've never seen it
go this far though.

224
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,387
[MIYAMOTO] I don't see
any way to escape this.

225
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,348
All right, fine! I surrender!

226
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,266
[SHINRA]
What?

227
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,810
If you're not just a gang
of self‐righteous murderers,

228
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,270
you'll let me off, won't you?

229
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,522
I was found "not
guilty" at my trial,

230
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,815
so you can't kill me.

231
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,775
It's against the law! Right?

232
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,943
[gunshot]

233
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,573
[HINAWA] You aren't wrong,
but I'm not so good‐natured

234
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,700
as to forgive scum like you.

235
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,411
You'll kill me even
if I don't fight.

236
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,165
Whelp, that settles it‐‐
you are just murderers!

237
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,626
[MIYAMOTO laughing]

238
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,753
This isn't good.

239
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,130
If you guys get to go
around killing Infernals,

240
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,675
then I'm gonna go
around killing humans!

241
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,385
[SHINRA]
What should we do?

242
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,720
[OBI]
Go on ahead, Shinra.

243
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,014
You're the only one fast
enough to catch up to him.

244
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,642
Yeah, but, sir, he's self‐aware,
so should I still‐‐?

245
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,270
The fact is, he's
no longer human.

246
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,773
But even so, I get how you feel.

247
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,108
If I may, sir.

248
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,568
Shinra.

249
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,530
Pay no attention to
the words it says.

250
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,450
Dispose of that thing.

251
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,618
On the double.

252
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,911
Right!

253
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,040
[SHINRA]
Dispose of. Put to rest.

254
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,334
This is still a sentient being.

255
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,048
[OBI]
Hinawa. I'm sorry.

256
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,424
[HINAWA]
It's fine.

257
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:47,887
That needed to be said,
but not by our shining light.

258
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,685
[SHINRA]
If I back down from this,

259
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,772
then more innocent people
are going to get hurt.

260
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,858
[SHINRA]
So I'll do it!

261
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,487
[SHINRA]
I'll put him to rest!

262
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,624
[CITIZENS chattering]

263
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,917
[CITIZEN A]
It's an Infernal!

264
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,045
This city's startin' to feel
like a great big box o' toys.

265
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,172
Who should I play with first?

266
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,551
[MIYAMOTO]
Hm?

267
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,760
Hm?!

268
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,522
Where do you get off
interrupting my good time, kid?

269
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,941
Do you have any idea
how many people I saved

270
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,860
in my firefighter days?

271
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,236
Now that I've turned Infernal,

272
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,197
it's only fitting
I should kill a few.

273
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,200
But you killed people as
a firefighter, too, right?

274
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:55,621
Guess basic math is too much
for a dumb grunt like you.

275
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,958
That isn't even close
to the number I saved.

276
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,308
Who the hell is this guy?

277
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,981
I don't understand.
How are you this strong?

278
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,861
[MIYAMOTO]
You're some kind of devil.

279
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,700
I'm no devil.
I'm a brave hero!

280
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,540
I believe I just observed
a second Adolla Burst

281
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,210
coming from that
rookie Fire Soldier.

282
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,754
That rookie's the more
valuable specimen.

283
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,672
But for now, let's
focus on capturing

284
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,675
that self‐aware Infernal alive.

285
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,761
Retrieve him at once!

286
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,430
The flame is the soul's breath.

287
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,974
The black smoke
is the soul's release.

288
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,893
[MIYAMOTO]
No! Please! Don't do this!

289
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,019
Hold on a second!

290
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,355
The Sister isn't here
to pray for you,

291
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,565
so you'll have to settle for me.

292
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,359
Ashes thou wert and art.

293
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,153
Wait, please, no!
Don't kill me! I'm scared.

294
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,821
Can't you at least let
me meet my end

295
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,199
to the sound of a
Sister's prayer of peace!

296
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,659
Please!

297
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,580
Whatever, I guess that's fine.

298
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,583
The Sister and the others should
catch up with us before long.

299
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,169
Stay still and repent
till they get here.

300
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,964
'Kay. That's what I'll do.

301
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,217
[MIYAMOTO snarls]

302
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,889
I doubt a soul like
yours can be saved.

303
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,349
You aren't anyone's hero.

304
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,643
You're just a
half‐cocked wannabe!

305
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,602
Shut your mouth!

306
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,314
You've lied enough.
I'm putting you to rest.

307
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,368
I am the Captain of Special
Fire Force Company Five,

308
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,620
known as Princess Hibana.

309
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:06,460
The Fifth will handle
this Infernal's disposal.

310
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,170
What the hell did you put on me?

311
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,964
Let me go!

312
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,007
[HIBANA]
Take him away!

313
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:11,966
[CREWMAN A]
Ma'am!

314
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,177
Hold on! The Eighth is
already taking care of this.

315
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,388
Your help isn't needed,
so get out of here.

316
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,515
You miss the part
where I gave my rank?

317
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,225
Don't defy my orders.

318
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,020
You might be their captain,
but you aren't mine!

319
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,778
Damn you.

320
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,614
What did you do to me?

321
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,533
You pathetic lump of
Eighth Company gravel.

322
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,951
Don't you know that your place

323
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,995
is on the ground
beneath my feet?

324
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,205
The only sound I care
to hear from you

325
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,416
is the crunch, crunch,
crunch of my heels

326
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,710
being pressed into your back.

327
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,047
Now lick my shoe.

328
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,424
I get that you're tryin'
to put me in my place,

329
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,217
but isn't this
going a little far?

330
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,261
Do as you're told
and lick my shoe.

331
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,931
I'm trying to talk
to you seriously!

332
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,600
[chuckles]

333
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,899
[HIBANA]
Hold him down!

334
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,902
[ANGELS]
The Fifth Angels Three are here.

335
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,654
Ready for action.

336
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,660
[KISHIRI]
Out of the way! Move it!

337
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,375
Hey, you!

338
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,378
Fire Soldiers are supposed
to keep people safe.

339
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,130
Have you dirtbags at the
Fifth forgotten that?

340
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,217
C'mon, it's not like we
used the brat for kindling.

341
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,678
We'd have to dry him out first.

342
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,353
Don't even crack jokes
about burning children.

343
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,979
Not ever.

344
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,523
Oh?

345
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,859
I'm about to show you what
a Fire Soldier should be.

346
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,195
Come at me, Company Five!

347
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,863
You're up against
Shinra Kusakabe,

348
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,658
Second Class Fire
Soldier from the Eighth!

349
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,786
[HIBANA]
This should be fun.

350
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,292
[OBI]
What happened?

351
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,092
[HIBANA]
It's unusual for an Infernal

352
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,219
to be as lucid as this one.

353
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,347
Simply killing him
would be a waste.

354
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,058
Our research team
will make use of him.

355
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,436
You must know you're in
the Eighth's jurisdiction.

356
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,188
Yet it feels like you're
trying to call the shots.

357
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,065
[HIBANA] Legally,
this man has been deceased

358
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,984
since the moment he transformed.

359
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,695
You could extinguish him
and return him to ash,

360
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,448
but you'll agree that this
corpse would be easier

361
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,575
to study in its current state.

362
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,952
And the Eighth is
a newer company.

363
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,830
I'm told that you've yet
to recruit a science team.

364
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,291
This is quite the rare specimen.

365
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,878
If solving the mystery of human
combustion is a goal we share,

366
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,254
then you should
want this Infernal

367
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,048
to be researched by the Fifth.

368
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,551
Can I take that as a promise
that you'll share the results

369
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,595
of your research with us?

370
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,764
Oh, absolutely!

371
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,436
[OBI]
Very well.

372
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,230
I'll leave the Infernal
in your custody.

373
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,650
[KISHIRI]
Someone's scared.

374
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,943
Huh?

375
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,116
I hear you're a powerless
nobody, Captain.

376
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,535
So it's no wonder
you backed down.

377
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,205
The mayor of Loserville.

378
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,915
You better watch your
mouth, or else.

379
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,082
[SHINRA]
You wanna fight, punk?

380
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,542
Oh, dear me, I've pissed off

381
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,212
Captain Nobody's
Second‐Class lackies.

382
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,215
Shinra! Arthur! Break it up!

383
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,508
[SHINRA, ARTHUR,
KISHIRI shouting]

384
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,634
[KISHIRI grunts]

385
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,013
[BOTH]
Uhh.

386
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,224
[humming]

387
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,308
[grunts]

388
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,983
A quick warning.

389
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,528
If a brave little firefighter
should stick his nose

390
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,196
where it doesn't belong,

391
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:06,575
he'll run the risk of being
extinguished himself.

392
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,118
Well, thanks for the tip.

393
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,831
It sounds like I've been blowin'
smoke in somebody's face.

394
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,834
Thing is, my flame
is Company Eight's,

395
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,753
and it won't go out easy.

396
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,380
[chuckles]

397
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,310
[HIBANA] Special Fire Force
Company Five, we're leaving.

1
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,273
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

2
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,735
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

3
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,529
But out of that long,
morbid list,

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,074
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

5
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:55,991
Huh?

6
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,497
Sister.

7
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,124
[gasps] I, um‐‐

8
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,251
Crap, my bad.

9
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,129
[SHINRA]
Was she crying?

10
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,091
I really am sorry for intruding.

11
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,843
Oh, no. You're okay.

12
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,512
I'm not used to people
coming through this early.

13
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,390
Anyway, take care with
your training, Shinra.

14
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,768
Thanks, I'll do that.

15
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,978
[IRIS]
Well, see ya later.

16
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,231
[SHINRA
Hey. Uh, Sister?

17
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,737
Thought I'd ask:
Is something bothering you?

18
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,325
[SHINRA]
I'm happy to help if I can.

19
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,243
It's why I took this job.

20
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,500
Thank you for your concern.

21
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,315
[OBI] After the dust‐up you
had with them yesterday,

22
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:37,235
this is probl'y obvious, but
Company Five can't be trusted.

23
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,570
We're looking into
their affairs,

24
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,239
and it could come to blows.

25
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,783
That's impressive, sir.

26
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,368
Is this a new training regimen
you've come up with

27
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,205
or some kind of performance art?

28
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,958
Hinawa!

29
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,587
Recall that our primary
objective is to protect people

30
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,340
by fighting Infernals and
putting them to rest.

31
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,342
However, we can't
forget that the Eighth

32
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,468
has a hidden objective:

33
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,221
To investigate suspicious crew
members within other companies

34
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,724
and oppose the ones
guilty of misconduct.

35
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,767
It's just as the captain said...

36
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,310
[SHINRA]
I'm so distracted by his cap

37
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,270
that I can't hear
a word he's saying.

38
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,356
[HINAWA]
...Company Five lies squarely...

39
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,107
More of those wretched griffins.

40
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,527
Come to attack my
castle again, eh?

41
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,780
Someday you'll be rust
on Excalibur's blade.

42
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,658
[SHINRA] Do you even understand
how your blade works?

43
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,327
Yeah, how about you put a lid
on that knightly temper of yours

44
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,871
and leave those adorable
"griffins" alone?

45
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,500
There are wildlife protection
laws for a reason, ya know.

46
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,585
It's kinda funny hearing
you tell someone else

47
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,379
to control their temper.

48
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,338
You have a point.

49
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,339
Ninety percent of the time,

50
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,967
Maki's just as cool‐headed
as she is beautiful.

51
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,761
It's a real shame about
the other ten percent.

52
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,137
I'm trying, okay?

53
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:46,847
[SHINRA, IRIS gasp]

54
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,181
No idle chatter.

55
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,475
We're in the middle of an
important meeting here.

56
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,810
Shut your mouths and focus.

57
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,854
Hey, Lieutenant,
I know you're kidding,

58
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,189
but could you please not
point your gun at us?

59
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,483
[HINAWA] What the hell made
you think I was kidding?

60
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,487
[SHINRA screams]

61
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,196
<i>Látom</i>.

62
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,781
Somebody get a doctor!

63
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,617
My leg! It hurts!

64
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,077
Huh?

65
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,871
Less than it should, though.

66
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,832
No way. An airgun?

67
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,919
No. It's very real.

68
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,797
Lieutenant Hinawa is a
second‐generation Fire Soldier,

69
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,882
the same as I am.

70
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,550
So he can't create fires,

71
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,094
but he is able to control
them once they ignite.

72
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,721
He weakened the
gunpowder's explosion

73
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,557
so the bullet would hit you
with non‐lethal force.

74
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,938
Fire Soldiers are versatile.
Hard to predict.

75
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,026
Unlike the Infernals we fight,
humans use all sorts of tactics.

76
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,235
You should all keep
your wits about you

77
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,737
when you fight them.

78
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,823
Excepting Arthur, of course,
since he has none.

79
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,199
[ARTHUR chuckles]

80
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,289
Perhaps I'll get some
when I slay this dragon.

81
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:58,084
You've got quite the
imagination, don't you?

82
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,669
Your training begins now.

83
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,589
I'll drill you punks
into the floor.

84
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,674
You're way too
focused on my fists.

85
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,344
Study your opponent's
whole body!

86
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,887
Listen, Lieutenant.

87
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,722
The thing is,
someone in the Fifth

88
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,517
joked about burning civilians
and I can't let that slide.

89
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,895
What's the deal with
that captain of theirs?

90
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,273
[HINAWA] Princess Hibana is a
third‐generation Fire Soldier.

91
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,651
She started out as a
recruit from Haijima

92
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,987
and shot up the ranks
with astonishing speed.

93
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,238
It looks like she did this

94
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,532
through illegal
research on Infernals.

95
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,202
All while selling
off her findings.

96
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,663
And these findings,

97
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,456
do you think they might
have anything to do

98
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,208
with human combustion?

99
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,126
She at least discovered
something big enough

100
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,338
to turn a nobody into
a captain overnight.

101
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,758
Whatever that might be, I'm sure
she'll have it documented.

102
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,678
We'll search their base
through force if we must.

103
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,722
Your feet and Arthur's
plasma can help with that.

104
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,559
Forget the documents.
I'm in it just to smash them.

105
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,440
[MIYAMOTO screaming]

106
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,358
No more!

107
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,568
It hurts so bad.
I'm beggin' you, stop!

108
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,653
And why should I?

109
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,321
You're gravel! Just gravel!

110
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,864
[MIYAMOTO screaming]

111
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,950
[HIBANA] Stop whining
and shut your mouth.

112
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,326
I'm talking to your body.

113
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,328
If there's anything about
you I don't know yet,

114
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,705
it'll tell me soon.

115
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,373
Those who aren't me
are just gravel,

116
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,291
and that most certainly
goes for you.

117
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,836
So why don't you pave
the way to my happiness?

118
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,005
Repulsive dung.

119
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,172
You gotta stop!

120
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,549
Keep that up
and it'll come out!

121
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,969
What do I care if you scream?
Your pain's meaningless to me!

122
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,013
Because you're just dung
strewn with gravel,

123
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,224
and I'm a powerful,
beautiful princess!

124
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:42,313
[HIBANA laughing]

125
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,697
The flame is the soul's breath.

126
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,075
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

127
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:58,872
Ashes thou wert and art,
may thy soul return...

128
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,958
...to the great flame of fire.

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,293
<i>Látom</i>.

130
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,783
[SHINRA]
That smile was strained.

131
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,035
Of all people, I should know.

132
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,412
Maybe it has to do
with the Fifth.

133
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,375
Hey, quick question.

134
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,294
D you know if something's
going on with the Sister?

135
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,045
What's that?

136
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,340
The princess has named me
commander of the order?

137
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:54,302
Guess that dumb imagination of
yours runs 24/7, doesn't it?

138
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,101
So what's the deal? You think
the princess is in peril?

139
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,853
Will you please stop calling
the Sister a princess?

140
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,064
For real. You stopped with Maki.

141
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:06,815
That's because
Maki's an ogress‐‐

142
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,358
Hey, you guys awake?

143
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,609
[ARTHUR snores]

144
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,902
[MAKI]
Uh?

145
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,821
Good evening, Maki. What's up?

146
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,157
I was wondering if one of you
knew where Sister Iris was.

147
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,408
[SHINRA]
Huh?

148
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,876
Apologies.

149
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,669
[5TH SOLDIER A]
It's fine.

150
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,130
But what's a Sister doing
here at this hour?

151
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,340
[IRIS] I was actually hoping
to meet with your captain.

152
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,884
[5TH SOLDIER A]
Uh. Doesn't seem likely.

153
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,803
Say that Iris has
come to see her,

154
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,473
and I think her response
might surprise you.

155
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:44,352
Is there something you wanted,
my little Miss Have‐not?

156
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,521
[IRIS] I'm not sure what
exactly you're doing,

157
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,315
but from what I've heard,
it sounds really dangerous.

158
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,234
Furthermore, it's clear
that your research

159
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,027
is corrupt and blasphemous.

160
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,864
Are you defying the
great Sol on purpose?

161
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,160
Sister, please.

162
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,870
[HIBANA]
You've got some nerve

163
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,372
wearing that habit
in front of me!

164
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,253
[IRIS gasps]

165
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,922
Why? I don't understand!

166
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,841
The Sisters are used
by the Fire Force

167
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,218
as nothing more than
window‐dressing.

168
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,888
And you've devoted your
life to that nonsense?

169
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,391
Looks like you're just as
foolish as you've always been.

170
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,352
Don't you talk to me about
your "great god Sol."

171
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,521
You're praying to
the ghost of a dream.

172
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,607
There's no god in this country.

173
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,276
Hell. There's no god
in this whole world.

174
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,738
Although there are a
few devils like myself.

175
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,199
[IRIS]
Devils.

176
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,296
Using you as bait,
I'll lure the Eighth here

177
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,797
and grind them into dust.

178
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,424
No!

179
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,134
[alarm blaring]

180
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,386
[5TH SOLDIER B] What was that?
Some kind of mortar?

181
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,346
[5TH SOLDIER C]
Think it's human,

182
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,473
but they came from the sky.

183
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,308
Who the hell are you?

184
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,268
I'm a hero, of course.

185
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,730
But specifically, I'm part
of Company Eight.

186
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:14,317
You can call me Save‐Sister‐
Iris‐by‐Crushing‐the‐Fifth‐Man.

187
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,731
Pardon, Lieutenant!

188
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,484
But isn't what we're doing
kinda reckless and illegal?

189
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,194
We believe the Fifth
has been carrying out

190
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,488
some pretty shady
research at this facility,

191
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,366
so I doubt they'll file
any police reports.

192
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,964
[HINAWA] Use those devil
feet to find the Sister.

193
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,966
Maki and I'll handle
things here.

194
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,385
You're gonna take on all
these guys by yourselves?

195
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,221
Start tearing things up
inside as fast as you can.

196
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,181
That'll give us some
breathing room.

197
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,141
Go!

198
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,767
Yes, sir.

199
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,227
You go, too, Arthur.

200
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,395
We'll watch your back!

201
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,398
Just don't forget to watch
your own back, Lieutenant.

202
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,860
Here he comes!

203
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,028
[5TH SOLDIER C gasps]

204
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,534
[5TH SOLDIER D yells]

205
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,077
He's fast!

206
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,582
[ARTHUR]
Do not discount.

207
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,292
That was the flat side.

208
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,130
[5TH SOLDIER E yells]

209
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,509
We can't just watch! Get him!

210
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,263
You won't escape my discipline,
so don't you dare start running!

211
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,807
[FIRE FORCE SOLDIERS yelling]

212
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,100
[5TH SOLDIER G]
Run for it!

213
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,200
[MAKI]
Not that this is anything new,

214
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,619
but I feel like you show
more mercy to Infernals

215
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,954
than you do to people
sometimes, Lieutenant.

216
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,082
[HINAWA] I didn't join
the Special Fire Force,

217
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,417
I joined Captain Obi's
Company Eight.

218
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,336
I did it 'cause I wanted
to knock some heads,

219
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,172
and force certain idiots
to listen to reason.

220
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,383
You should start
knocking heads, too.

221
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,051
Knock 'em around
until someone gives up

222
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,012
that research data on
spontaneous combustion.

223
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,848
I left the Military and joined
up with the Special Fire Force

224
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,225
against my father's wishes

225
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,811
because I'd rather save
people than fight them.

226
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,022
So I'm not too keen on
man‐to‐man combat.

227
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:58,815
[HINAWA]
Didn't seem that way

228
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,942
when you hit that
rookie from the Fifth.

229
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,529
[MAKI] That was just a tap.
It doesn't count.

230
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,949
I have to admit, that Devil's
quick when he wants to be.

231
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,326
Wish I could see
which way he went.

232
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,291
Look at that.
The Devil's footprints.

233
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,460
[CONEHEAD chuckles]

234
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,003
I take it that you're
trying to follow

235
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,256
the Devil's footprints as well.

236
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,134
[ARTHUR] It's dangerous here.
Back to your farm, old man.

237
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,386
Lest your head be
damaged even worse.

238
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,179
[CONEHEAD] I can't allow
you to snoop around

239
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,432
my company's base.

240
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,435
I'll roast you alive.

241
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,437
Not you again.

242
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,357
[CONEHEAD]
By administering a special drug

243
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,608
I've been developing,

244
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,445
I've boosted this
Infernal's firepower.

245
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,737
I'm quite pleased to have had

246
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,115
such a fine specimen
to work with.

247
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,367
[ARTHUR]
We meet again, Manslayer.

248
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,995
By this sword, you'll soon...

249
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,872
By this very sword‐‐

250
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,166
This sword will soon...

251
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,135
[KISHIRI]
Those punks from the Eighth

252
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,596
are way too full of themselves.

253
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,016
[HINAWA]
What's that?

254
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,436
Crap. Stay back, Lieutenant!

255
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,984
[MAKI]
That was some real firepower.

256
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,029
'Course it is. Damn nobody.

257
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,739
[KISHIRI] I just blow
some flammable gas

258
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,866
into my oxygen‐free bubble gum,

259
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,286
send it over to my target,
and pop the bubble.

260
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,332
When the flammable gas
hits fresh oxygen...

261
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,502
...it goes boom.

262
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,836
And that's the magic behind

263
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,757
Toru Kishiri's Backdraft
Bubblish Gum!

264
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,343
Another. Another! Another!

265
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,098
Hey. Can you see where
they're coming from?

266
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,725
From inside that warehouse.

267
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,977
I believe the target's
just around the corner.

268
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,771
Though I can't be sure.

269
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,481
[HINAWA]
I can work with that.

270
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,575
Oh, gimme a break. What
the hell're you aiming at?

271
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,619
I use the sparks
they create on impact

272
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,121
to adjust each bullet's path.

273
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,336
Uh‐oh.

274
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,589
[screaming]

275
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,598
How pathetic.

276
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,643
You'd need way more than
that to stop our rookies.

277
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,145
Come on, let's persuade
these crewmen to tell us

278
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,647
where the documents are.

279
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,315
Right.

280
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,650
[ANGEL A]
Hold it!

281
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,612
The Fifth Angels Three are here.

282
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,739
‐‐Let's fight!
‐‐Attack!

283
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,492
[CONEHEAD] Have you made
your peace yet, boy?

284
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,661
The fact that I've found
you here all by yourself

285
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,705
tells me the Eighth
is as undermanned

286
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,416
as our intel suggested.

287
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,835
The Infernal I have
fortified through science

288
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,839
will soon reduce you to cinders.

289
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,675
He's a cutting‐edge weapon
that can condense his fire

290
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:16,012
into one small point,
then release it!

291
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,350
I don't wanna see
one trace of a body.

292
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,977
That isn't gonna be a problem.

293
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,312
'Cause thanks to that drug,

294
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,023
the fire inside my
body is surging now!

295
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,357
See for yourself!

296
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,901
I'm about ready to explode!

297
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,577
That was close.
What's goin' on here?

298
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,621
Tryin' to cook some
Knight Teriyaki?

299
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,080
Knight Teriyaki?

300
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,542
But you don't have any armor,
and I don't have any sauce!

301
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,839
[ARTHUR] I alight upon
this scorched red Earth.

302
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,842
Clad in a raiment
of glorious gold!

303
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,054
[MIYAMOTO] Huh? Then I guess
I'll make tempura!

304
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,642
Come on, why even fight?

305
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,602
I'm a knight.

306
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,730
[static crackles]

307
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,649
[HIBANA]
Status report?

308
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,985
[5TH SOLDIER J] The Angels are
fighting Hinawa and Maki.

309
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,945
Arthur's up against
the Infernal.

310
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,074
No one's seen Obi yet,
but he should be near.

311
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,369
[HIBANA] Moths do love
their flames, don't they?

312
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,330
Burn the lot of them and
leave no trace behind.

313
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:28,334
The truth, the intrigue
behind spontaneous combustion,

314
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,628
it was found through
our research.

315
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,756
I won't let gravel
steal it from us.

316
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,052
Are you sure you're
a Fire Soldier?

317
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,554
'Cause you're not putting up
much of a fight right now.

318
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,932
What's wrong,
ya scared or somethin'?

319
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,974
[chuckles]

320
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,606
[MIYAMOTO] I can see through
your act, tough guy.

321
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,193
[yells]

322
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,990
You put on a cute show.

323
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,244
But beneath that false
confidence, you're crazy weak.

324
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,620
And stupid, too.

325
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,706
Damn. What's going on?

326
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,041
Why do I feel so
out of form today?

327
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,002
[CONEHEAD] It isn't a question
of whether you're "in form."

328
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,923
My Infernal's firepower is
simply too much for you.

329
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,425
[MIYAMOTO]
Of course a punk like you

330
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,010
would blame your weakness
on somethin' or another.

331
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,595
You're not havin' a bad day‐‐

332
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,598
you were never any
good to begin with!

333
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,352
You've made exactly the kind
of excuse I'd expect to hear

334
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,646
from a dumb phony like you!

335
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:31,522
Say what?

336
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,065
[CONEHEAD chuckles]

337
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,109
[CONEHEAD] It would seem
that this tenderfoot rookie

338
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,486
isn't even competent
enough to understand

339
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,322
how terribly outmatched he is.

340
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,284
[MIYAMOTO] And to hear him
blame it on his form is sad.

341
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,995
You can call yourself a
knight all you want, chump.

342
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:50,207
Fact is, you're just an idiot
who's all bark and no bite.

343
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,794
In truth, I'm more than a
knight. I'm a Knight King!

344
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,344
You tried to stick your nose
where it doesn't belong.

345
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,140
And now I'm about to reward you
with a quick, painful death!

346
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,933
Why? I don't get it.

347
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,519
My power's failed me completely.

348
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,481
[gasps]

349
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,693
Wait a sec. I'm definitely
right‐handed.

350
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,154
Why's Excalibur in my left hand?

351
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,281
[MIYAMOTO]
Huh?! How should I know?

352
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,910
You can ask whatever you find
waiting in the afterlife!

353
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,966
That was my Violet Flash.

354
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,895
That's better. I thought
I felt something strange.

355
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,147
What did I just witness?

356
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,817
He's absurdly strong!

357
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,861
5th Angels Three!
Three‐on‐Three!

358
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,531
Triple Grating Slasher
Version Two Point Three!

359
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,657
[yells]

360
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,410
[MAKI]
That's way too many...

361
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,787
...threes!

362
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,874
[HINAWA] For some reason,
I thought there were

363
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,794
just three Fifth Angels Three...

364
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,254
...but it looks like
we got all of them.

365
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,798
[ANGEL C whimpering]

366
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,632
Well, good.

367
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,386
I wonder how things are going
for Arthur and Shinra.

368
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,888
[HINAWA] While the two of them
dash around spreading havoc,

369
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,349
we can track down
those documents.

370
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,609
Here we go.

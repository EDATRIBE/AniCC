00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,708
- ( laughs )

172
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,375
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

173
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,875
- ( beeping )
- ( slurps )

174
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,166
SO THAT'S HER STORY.
( chuckles )

175
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,083
( slurps )

176
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,666
- NOW EXPLAIN IT AGAIN
AND THIS TIME TRY MAKING SENSE.

177
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,125
- Ayeka: YOU CAN START
BY TELLING US WHY YOU CAME HERE.

178
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,500
- TO SEE MY DADDY.

179
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,166
I REALLY LOVE MY DADDY.

180
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,666
- HE'S NOT YOUR DADDY!
- STOP YELLING AT HER.

181
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,666
YOU'RE NOT HELPING THINGS.
- OH FINE!

182
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,833
- WE KNOW YOUR NAME ALREADY,
BUT WHERE ARE YOU FROM, MAYUKA?

183
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,083
- AH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
- WHAT?!

184
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,958
NOW STOP PLAYING
GAMES WITH US!

185
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,083
- I AM NOT PLAYING A
GAME, BELIEVE ME.

186
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,291
- UH, WE'LL LET'S TRY
A DIFFERENT TACT.

187
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,833
WHERE IS YOUR MOTHER? WHY ISN'T
SHE HERE WITH YOU, HUH, DEAR?

188
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,500
- MY MOTHER?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

189
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,833
- I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT MY MOTHER,

190
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,166
BUT I REMEMBER
MY FATHER'S FACE VERY WELL.

191
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,583
- OH. DID YOUR MOTHER
DIE, MAYUKA?

192
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,583
- HUH-UH.

193
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,291
- THEN WHY DON'T
YOU REMEMBER HER?

194
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,916
- I DON'T KNOW. I JUST
DON'T REMEMBER, THAT'S ALL.

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,833
- HEY, MAYBE SHE HAS
AMNESIA OR SOMETHING.

196
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,833
- WHOA, BUT WAIT A MINUTE,
HOW COULD SHE HAVE AMNESIA?

197
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,000
SHE REMEMBERS MY FACE
OR THINKS SHE DOES.

198
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,833
- Washu: TENCHI?
- HUH?

199
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,166
- OH UH, HI THERE. I WAS JUST
ON MY WAY TO TAKE A BATH.

200
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,958
- I DISCOVERED SOMETHING
VERY INTERESTING

201
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,666
ABOUT THAT GIRL, TENCHI.

202
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,208
- HUH?
WHAT WAS THAT?

203
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,375
- FIRST OFF, YOU REALLY
ARE HER FATHER. CONGRATS.

204
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,625
- HEY, YOU WANT TO HAVE
SOME WATERMELON, WASHU?

205
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,958
- AFFIRMATIVE.

206
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,875
- HEY, EVERYONE, I'M CUTTING
UP SOME WATERMELON.

207
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,833
WANT SOME?
- ( moans )

208
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,041
WASHU, HOW CAN I BE
THAT GIRL'S FATHER?

209
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,791
- Ryoko: AND WASHU EXPECTS US
TO BELIEVE THAT NONSENSE?

210
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,125
- LET'S SEE, MAYUKA SAYS
SHE'S TENCHI'S DAUGHTER,

211
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,833
SO THAT MEANS HER MOTHER
MUST BE TENCHI'S WIFE.

212
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,875
THAT'S ONLY LOGICAL.

213
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,541
- WHAT?
LOOK, MIHOSHI,

214
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,958
THERE'S NO PROOF OF ANY OF THIS

215
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,125
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
QUIT CHATTERING?

216
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,125
- THAT'S RIGHT, AND JUST WHEN
DID TENCHI GET MARRIED ANYWAY?

217
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,083
TELL ME THAT, HUH?
- THAT'S EASY.

218
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,375
HE GOT MARRIED IN THE FUTURE.

219
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,208
- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT LITTLE BRAT

220
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,416
RIGHT THERE
IS FROM THE FUTURE?

221
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,416
- OH LOOK,
THEY REALLY FLEW!

222
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,583
- ( laughs )
- SHE IS NOT TENCHI'S DAUGHTER.

223
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,583
- ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
- Washu: WRONG-O.

224
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,791
MIHOSHI'S GOT IT
RIGHT THIS TIME.

225
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:09,833
- HUH?

226
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,791
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, GIRLS.
I TESTED

227
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,625
THE GENETIC STRUCTURE OF HER
HAIR. HEY, THIS LOOKS GOOD.

228
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,708
ANYWAY HALF OF HER DNA MATCHES
TENCHI'S JUST AS YOU'D EXPECT

229
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,416
FROM HER FATHER.
- ( gasps )

230
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,291
- SEE, I JUST KNEW IT.
- THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

231
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,875
- MAYBE, BUT THERE WAS A RIP
IN THE TIME-SPACE GRID.

232
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,541
IT HAPPENED RIGHT BEFORE
SHE SHOWED UP OUT OF NOWHERE.

233
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,333
QUITE A COINCIDENCE, HUH?

234
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,791
- THEN YOU MEAN SHE REALLY
DID COME FROM THE FUTURE?

235
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:35,791
- WELL, THERE'S NO PROOF YET.

236
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,416
I STILL HAVEN'T
QUITE FIGURED OUT

237
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,000
THE MOTHER'S SIDE OF HER DNA.

238
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,791
MAYBE IT'S ONE
OF YOU LUCKY GIRLS.

239
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,833
- LORD TENCHI'S WIFE--
ONE OF US GIRLS?

240
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:50,250
IT MIGHT BE ME. I CAN JUST
IMAGINE BEING HIS BRIDE.

241
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,000
- OH YEAH, FAT CHANCE, AYEKA.
- COULD BE ME, YOU KNOW,

242
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,666
WHEN I'M ALL GROWN UP.

243
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,000
- WOW, IT COULD BE ME TOO.
- HUH?

244
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,666
- COME ON, GIRLS, YOU'RE ALL
TOO YOUNG TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

245
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,625
- ( laughs )
- VERY FUNNY.

246
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,541
NOW WHICH ONE OF US
LOOKS LIKE MAYUKA?

247
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,208
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU THINK, MAYUKA?

248
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,041
HMM?
- All: WHAT?

249
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,625
- I KNOW WHERE SHE WENT!

250
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,000
- ( thinking )
A DAUGHTER FROM THE FUTURE.

251
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,291
TALK ABOUT CONFUSING.
I SURE DON'T FEEL LIKE A FATHER.

252
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,083
MAYBE THIS IS JUST
WASHU'S IDEA OF A JOKE.

253
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,583
ANYWAY I'M GLAD I COULD COME
HERE AND GET AWAY FROM ALL THAT.

254
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,458
- GUESS WHO.
- ( yelps )

255
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:36,041
( gasps )
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

256
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,125
- YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE ME
BEHIND LIKE THAT, DADDY.

257
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,083
IT'S SO MEAN.
I WANT TO BE HERE.

258
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,041
- I'M TAKING A BATH
HERE, MAYUKA.

259
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,416
- GOOD, I'LL TAKE ONE WITH YOU.

260
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,541
YOU'RE TURNING RED, DADDY.
- MAYUKA, GET OFF OF ME!

261
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,833
- OH.
- LISTEN TO ME.

262
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,791
STAY RIGHT THERE. I'M GOING TO
GET OUT AND PUT ON A TOWEL.

263
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,708
- DON'T GET OUT YET, DADDY!
- YEOW!

264
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,125
- I'LL SCRUB YOUR BACK, OKAY?
JUST LIKE I USED TO DO BEFORE.

265
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,958
- TENCHI!
( growls )

266
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,541
- ( yelps )
- RYOKO, NOW CALM DOWN.

267
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,291
IT'S NOW HOW IT SEEMS.
I CAN EXPLAIN.

268
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,833
RYOKO?
- ( roaring )

269
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,250
- LISTEN TO ME PLEASE!

270
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,125
- I'M GOING TO GET THAT
BRAZEN LITTLE HUSSY.

271
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,250
SHE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT SHE'S DOING!

272
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,708
- ( yelps )

273
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,791
HUH?
- THERE'S A GOOD GIRL.

274
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,791
NEXT TIME YOU CAN TAKE
A BATH WITH YOUR GRANDPA.

275
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,291
- ARE YOU TENCHI'S DADDY?

276
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,291
- WELL, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
- OKAY, THAT'LL BE FUN!

277
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,333
- ( laughing )
- IS IT JUST ME

278
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,166
OR IS SHE WEIRD?

279
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,000
- ( screams )
YOU BIG FOOL!

280
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,208
SPOILING THINGS JUST
WHEN IT'S GETTING GOOD.

281
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,125
( grunts )

282
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,416
( screams )

283
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,125
- HMM, NOT A BAD HAUL.

284
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,416
AHH, DELICIOUS.

285
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,833
- HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY FRIENDS AROUND HERE?

286
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,375
- THERE WERE THREE OF THEM.

287
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,333
- I TOLD THEM
I'D MEET THEM HERE,

288
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,750
BUT I COULDN'T SNEAK
OUT OF THE PALACE IN TIME.

289
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,833
HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

290
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,041
THE STARTICA FESTIVAL
IS TOMORROW.

291
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,625
EAT THIS AND YOUR WISH
WILL COME TRUE.

292
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,416
YOU'LL MEET SOMEONE YOU LOVE.

293
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,458
HERE.
IT'S DELICIOUS.

294
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,625
FROM THE PALACE.
TRY IT.

295
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,333
- HUH? OH.

296
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,583
- IT'S TENCHI'S DNA,
BUT THE CODE

297
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,958
ON THE MOTHER'S SIDE HAS
BEEN BLURRED ON PURPOSE

298
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,750
SO IT'S UNREADABLE.

299
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,458
SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO HIDE SOMETHING.

300
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:01,291
HMMM, WHO COULD HER MOTHER BE?
- Mayuka: NO, DON'T!

301
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,125
- YOU'LL CATCH COLD, MAYUKA.
YOUR HAIR'S DRIPPING WET.

302
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,791
- OH OUCH!
- THAT DOESN'T HURT.

303
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,333
- OKAY, LET ME COMB
YOUR HAIR NOW, MAYUKA.

304
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,916
- I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED.
YOU WERE VERY BRAVE, YOU KNOW.

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,666
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- THE WAY YOU CHALLENGED RYOKO.

306
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,791
SHE'S A TOUGH COOKIE.
- OH.

307
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,666
- OKAY, LIFT UP YOUR ARMS!
- ALL RIGHT.

308
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,708
- HOLD STILL NOW.
- WHEW!

309
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,666
- ROWR.
- OHHH.

310
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:30,208
MAYUKA, YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.
WOW.

311
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,375
- ( giggling )

312
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,583
I LIKE BEING PRETTY.

313
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,750
I KNOW!
I'LL GO SHOW DADDY.

314
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,875
- TENCHI'S ROOM IS
RIGHT UP THOSE STAIRS.

315
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:43,875
- THANKS!

316
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,250
- Mihoshi: OH.

317
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,791
WOW, IT'S SILVER
AND IT'S SHINY.

318
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,541
- Washu: WHAT'S THAT, MIHOSHI?

319
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,291
- OH, LOOK, WASHU.
IT'S SO PRETTY AND SILVERY.

320
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,791
- WHERE DID THIS HAIR COME FROM?

321
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,375
- I FOUND IT AFTER
I BRUSHED HER HAIR.

322
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,500
- ( gasps )
SO IT'S MAYUKA'S.

323
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,958
- ( sighs ) I NEVER DREAMT
I'D BE A FATHER AT MY AGE.

324
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,458
WHAT AM I SAYING?
I CAN'T BE A FATHER, NO WAY.

325
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,916
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, HUH?
- KEEP OUT, MAYUKA.

326
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,375
YOU MAY NOT ENTER TENCHI'S ROOM.
HE'S NOT FEELING VERY WELL.

327
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,375
- OH, I'M REALLY SORRY.

328
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,083
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, MAYUKA.
HOW'S TENCHI DOING?

329
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,541
- I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
HE'S NOT FEELING WELL RIGHT NOW.

330
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,041
- OH, I'M SORRY. HEY, YOU WANT
TO PLAY A GAME WITH ME?

331
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,208
- HUH?
- OKAY?

332
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,666
- MM-HMM.

333
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,333
- ( crackling )

334
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,333
- THAT'S IT! NOW I'VE GOT
ALL THE DATA I NEED.

335
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,458
I JUST HAVE TO PUT IT
TOGETHER.

336
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,708
- FIRST FOLD IT OVER
THEN PRESS.

337
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,791
- FIRST OVER THEN PRESS.

338
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,833
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- I DON'T THINK THAT I GET IT.

339
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,500
CAN YOU SHOW ME
ONE MORE TIME, SASAMI?

340
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,875
- OH, MIHOSHI,
YOU DID IT BACKWARDS.

341
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,541
- HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

342
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,958
- Nobuyuki: I TALKED IT OVER
WITH MY FATHER.

343
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,791
WE BOTH DECIDED TO LET
THE GIRL STAY HERE FOR A WHILE,

344
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,250
AT LEAST UNTIL WE FIND OUT
WHO HER PARENTS ARE.

345
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,375
SAY, WHY ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ABOUT THAT?

346
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,041
- I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST LIKE HAVING HER HERE.

347
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,500
EVEN THOUGH SHE
IS A BIT STRANGE.

348
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,291
- OH, THAT'S TRUE.

349
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,875
- THERE, A PRETTY CRANE.

350
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,250
- HEY, I GOT ONE TOO.
ISN'T IT CUTE?

351
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,041
WOW.
- I'M FINISHED, LOOK!

352
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,333
- WELL, YOU MADE SOME MEN,
NOT A CRANE, BUT IT'S GOOD.

353
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,666
- ( laughs )

354
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,000
- I'M GONNA MAKE MORE OF
THESE BIRDIES, LOTS MORE!

355
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,625
- GOOD, YOU CAN GIVE ONE OF THEM
TO TENCHI WHEN HE WAKES UP.

356
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,250
IT'LL MAKE A GREAT PRESENT.
- A PRESENT?

357
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,333
AH, I ALMOST FORGOT!

358
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,250
I'VE GOT THIS PRESENT
TO GIVE TO MY DADDY.

359
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,833
- WHAT IS IT?
- PRESENT?

360
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,875
- ( whirring )

361
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,916
- Mihoshi:
WOW, IT'S SO PRETTY.

362
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,791
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S A CHRISTMAS TREE, ISN'T IT?

363
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,041
- CHRISTMAS? WHAT'S THAT?
- HUH?

364
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,750
- THIS IS FOR STARTICA, THE
SUMMER STAR FESTIVAL IN JURAI.

365
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,041
IT'S SO MUCH FUN.
- Sasami: I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

366
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,583
WELL, IT'S KINDA LIKE
CHRISTMAS, ISN'T IT?

367
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,583
- Mihoshi: WHAT'S STARTICA?
- IT'S SUMMER SOLSTICE

368
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,541
WHERE WE COME FROM ON JURAI.
THERE'S A TREE LIKE ON CHRISTMAS

369
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,625
BUT WE CELEBRATE MORE LIKE THE
JAPANESE SUMMER STAR FESTIVAL.

370
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,916
- MMM.

371
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,041
- IF A GIRL SPENDS STARTICA
WITH A SPECIAL BOY

372
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,166
THE MYTHS AND LEGENDS
SAY WHEN THEY GROW UP

373
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,750
THEY'LL BE DESTINED
TO FALL IN LOVE AND GET MARRIED.

374
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,291
GEE, IT MUST BE THE STARTICA
SEASON RIGHT NOW IN JURAI.

375
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,416
- THAT'S NICE.
SEEMS SO ROMANTIC AND ALL.

376
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,125
- MAYUKA FELL ASLEEP.
I WONDER WHO HER MOTHER IS.

377
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,541
MAYUKA?
- HMMM.

378
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,750
- ( soft snoring )

379
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,958
- YEAH, GREAT GUARDS.
UH-HUH.

380
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,875
HMMM.

381
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,750
- HEY, WAKE UP, MAYUKA.
MAYUKA!

382
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,625
- I SHOULD WEED THE FIELD
BEFORE IT GETS DARK.

383
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,375
I'M WAY BEHIND.

384
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,291
HMM, OH?

385
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,250
OH! YOU CHANGED
YOUR CLOTHES, MAYUKA.

386
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,625
- ( giggles )
- WHAT IS IT?

387
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,375
- I HAVE A GOOD IDEA.
COME WITH ME.

388
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,500
- WAIT, WHERE ARE
WE GOING, MAYUKA?

389
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,208
- TENCHI?
WHERE'D HE GO?

390
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,416
- MAYUKA, WHERE ARE
YOU TAKING ME?

391
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,291
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

392
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,541
( pants )

393
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,958
- TENCHI?

394
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,500
( gasps )
TENCHI!

395
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,583
- WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE?

396
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,500
- I LOVE YOU.
- WAH! I--

397
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,833
MAYUKA.

398
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,416
- ( gasps )
- Tenchi: NO.

399
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,791
- ( rumbling )

400
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,625
- ( gasps )
WHAT'S THIS?

401
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,958
- AHH, THAT'S THE SECOND TIME
IT'S HAPPENED TODAY!

402
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,666
- TENCHI, PLEASE.

403
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,583
LET'S BE TOGETHER NOW.

404
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,041
- TENCHI!

405
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,458
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

406
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,000
- MAYUKA?
- UH-HUH?

407
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:49,166
UH, HUH?

408
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,916
WHAT?
- UH-HHHH!

409
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,916
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?

410
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,958
IT WAS LIKE SOME KIND
OF HYPNOTIC TRANCE.

411
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,250
- I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

412
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,541
OH!
- RYOKO?

413
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,875
- I'M GOING TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, TENCHI.

414
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,916
I'M TAKING HER WITH ME NOW!
- NO! LET ME GO!

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,583
- RYOKO!
- DADDY!

416
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:12,333
- THIS IS SO CONFUSING.

417
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,291
- PLEASE PUT ME DOWN.

418
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,791
- THEN TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO?

419
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,625
WHERE WERE YOU TAKING TENCHI?

420
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:19,958
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

421
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,916
WE WERE GOING FOR A WALK.

422
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,833
- NOW YOU'RE GOING
FOR A DROP INSTEAD.

423
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,958
- YOU WOULDN'T DARE!
- ( growls )

424
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,500
- ( screams )

425
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:32,916
- DON'T WORRY, MAYUKA. I'LL SAY
GOODBYE TO YOUR DADDY FOR YOU.

426
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,500
- HEY, MAYUKA,
WHERE ARE YOU?

427
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,166
- IT'S DINNERTIME, MAYUKA.

428
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,166
- ( meows )

429
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,125
- RYO-OHKI, STOP BEGGING.

430
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,833
YOU KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
STAND BACK WHEN I'M DEEP FRYING.

431
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:52,833
- ( meows )

432
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,291
- HUH?
OH, RYOKO.

433
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,458
I THOUGHT IT WAS MAYUKA.
SHE'S MISSING.

434
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,708
- I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
- I SEE.

435
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,375
- Mihoshi: WE'RE BACK.

436
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,541
- I TAKE IT YOU DIDN'T
FIND HER THEN.

437
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,458
- DID YOU SEE ANYTHING AT ALL?
- SORRY, WE DIDN'T, TENCHI.

438
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,708
- IT'S TOO DARK NOW
TO LOOK ANYMORE.

439
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,916
- IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU GIRLS
TO SEARCH FOR HER.

440
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,541
GRANDFATHER'S LOOKING AS WELL.
WE'LL HOPE FOR THE BEST.

441
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:24,750
NOW WHO WANTS TO EAT?

442
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,458
- ( moans, gasps )

443
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,333
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?
I FELL FROM THE SKY,

444
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,500
BUT I--

445
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,375
I'M NOT HURT.

446
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,750
( screams )

447
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,250
WHAT'S GOING ON?

448
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:44,250
HOW DID I GET WAY UP HERE?
I'M GONNA FALL.

449
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,291
SOMEONE HELP ME!

450
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,083
- AHH, I LOST IT!
AND I WAS SO CLOSE.

451
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,458
SOMEONE MESSED
WITH THESE GENES.

452
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:54,208
HIDDEN DNA!
AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB OF IT.

453
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,708
THEY DON'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW
WHO MAYUKA'S MOTHER IS.

454
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:59,166
THAT'S FOR SURE.
- All: BON APPETIT.

455
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,333
- GEE, I DON'T SEE
ANY GIANT PRAWNS.

456
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:05,083
AND THERE'S NO
FISH TEMPURA EITHER.

457
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,291
- IT'S THE SPIRITS'
HOMECOMING DAY, REMEMBER?

458
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,291
WE'RE EATING SHOJIN.

459
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,083
- Mihoshi: WHAT
DOES SHOJIN MEAN?

460
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:13,416
- NO MEAT, NO FISH, EVERYTHING
IS STRICTLY VEGETARIAN.

461
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,916
- I SURE HOPE THAT MAYUKA
IS ALL RIGHT.

462
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,583
YOU SURE SHE WAS OKAY
WHEN YOU LEFT HER, RYOKO?

463
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:21,458
- YES. HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU
GOING TO ASK ME THIS, TENCHI?

464
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,583
- GRANDFATHER'S OUT
SEARCHING FOR HER.

465
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,500
IF ANYONE CAN
FIND HER, HE WILL.

466
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,375
- HMM, MAYBE.

467
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,625
I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR
HER MYSELF.

468
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:29,708
- ALL RIGHT.

469
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:30,958
- YOU'RE WASTING TIME.

470
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:31,958
SHE'LL COME BACK HERE WHEN SHE
FEELS LIKE IT.

471
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,208
- HA. HOW DO YOU KNOW?

472
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,541
- YOU SAID SHE WAS JUST
BOTHERING YOU ANYWAY,

473
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:38,000
SO WHY ARE YOU ALL
WORRIED ABOUT HER NOW?

474
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,166
- BECAUSE SHE COULD
BE IN TROUBLE, RYOKO.

475
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,208
WHAT IF SHE'S GOTTEN LOST? DON'T
YOU FEEL A LITTLE SORRY FOR HER?

476
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,416
- SORRY? LOOK, SHE MAY
HAVE YOU FOOLED, TENCHI,

477
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,875
BUT SHE IS UP TO SOMETHING
AND I'M NOT FALLING FOR IT.

478
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,583
- I DON'T KNOW, RYOKO,
SHE'S STRANGE,

479
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,375
THERE'S SOMETHING
SWEET ABOUT HER TOO.

480
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:54,041
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.

481
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,916
- Katsuhito:
TENCHI, ARE YOU THERE?

482
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:01,291
GUESS WHERE I FOUND HER.
ON TOP OF A CEDAR TREE.

483
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,916
SHE WAS CRYING HER EYES OUT.
IT'S OKAY, DEAR.

484
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,875
YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS NOW.
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK, MAYUKA.

485
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:07,958
- WELCOME HOME, MAYUKA.

486
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,958
- WE HAVE BEEN SO
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

487
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,125
- ( growls )

488
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,875
- Tenchi: HEY WAIT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

489
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:14,708
- Sasami: HEY!
- Mihoshi: WHAT'S WRONG?

490
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:20,458
- I HATE YOUR GUTS!
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, RYOKO?

491
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:23,041
TRYING TO GET RID OF ME?
- THAT'S RIGHT, KID.

492
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,250
YOU ARE IN MY WAY.
GET IT?

493
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,958
- ( gasps )
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

494
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,250
NO, RYOKO!
- JUST GET LOST!

495
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,500
- STOP IT, RYOKO!
I SAID STOP IT!

496
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,875
- TENCHI, THAT GIRL
CAME HERE TO DESTROY YOU.

497
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:39,000
I'M TRYING TO PROTECT YOU
SINCE YOU'RE SO CLUELESS

498
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,583
WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN.

499
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,541
TENCHI!
- STOP IT!

500
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,958
- THERE, NOW WE'RE GETTING SOME
ACTION. THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

501
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:53,750
- TENCHI.

502
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,250
- UH.

503
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:01,166
- ( sobs )
- I'M SORRY.

504
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,125
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
THE TRUTH ABOUT MAYUKA YET.

505
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,875
I DON'T KNOW WHAT BROUGHT
HER HERE TO OUR HOUSE

506
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,375
OR WHERE SHE'S FROM,

507
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:10,083
I'M IN THE DARK LIKE YOU,
BUT I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT HER.

508
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,625
DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHY, RYOKO?

509
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,666
BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF YOU ARRIVED
HERE JUST THE WAY SHE DID.

510
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,666
- ( gasps, sighs )
- IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT? REMEMBER?

511
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,458
- DADDY?
- I'M SORRY, MAYUKA.

512
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:23,791
YOU CALL ME YOUR FATHER,
BUT HOW CAN I BELIEVE THAT

513
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,083
WHEN THERE'S NO EVIDENCE AND YOU
DON'T HAVE CLEAR MEMORIES?

514
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,250
- WHAT?

515
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,208
- IT'S JUST A FANTASY
YOU HAVE, MAYUKA.

516
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:32,041
SO FOR ME, YOU'RE JUST LIKE ANY
OF THE OTHER GIRLS IN THE HOUSE.

517
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,791
- UH-HUH.
- HEY THERE,

518
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,541
IT MEANS YOU'RE VERY IMPORTANT
JUST LIKE THEM.

519
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,250
- Ryoko: YEAH.
- HUH?

520
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,833
- RIGHT, EXCEPT FOR RYOKO
WHO'S JUST IN THE WAY.

521
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:41,916
- HEY, RYOKO!

522
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,416
- HMM.

523
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,583
- ( laughs )
YOU'RE NOT MAKING MUCH PROGRESS

524
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,250
WITH TENCHI, ARE YOU?
- SHUT UP!

525
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,916
- OUCH!
THAT HURTS.

526
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,833
- RATS! WHY DID HE
HAVE TO SPOIL THINGS

527
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:54,666
WHEN THEY WERE JUST GETTING
GOOD? THAT PRINCE IS A PAIN.

528
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,500
THAT'S OKAY, NO WORRIES.

529
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,625
I'VE GOT BIG PLANS
FOR MY LITTLE MAYUKA.

530
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:05,250
- SILVER AND BLACK-- I CAN'T
FIGURE OUT THE SILVER PART OF IT

531
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,125
EXCEPT I KNOW
IT'S NOT FROM EARTH.

532
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:10,291
WHAT KIND OF DNA
PRODUCES REAL SILVER?

533
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,083
OH, BETTER EAT SOMETHING
IF I'M GONNA WORK ALL NIGHT.

534
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,083
- ( knocks )
- WHO'S THERE?

535
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:19,666
- IT'S ME, WASHU.
- LORD KATSUHITO, COME ON IN.

536
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,083
- I BROUGHT YOU A SNACK.
- WOW, THANKS!

537
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,958
BOY, THAT LOOKS GREAT.
I WAS STARVING!

538
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:28,208
- SO YOU DISCOVERED THIS SILVER
STRAND IN MAYUKA'S HAIR, EH?

539
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,166
- YEAH, DO YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

540
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,833
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

541
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:34,708
- BY THE WAY, AT 4:45 P.M.
THIS AFTERNOON,

542
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:37,791
THE TIME-SPACE CONTINUUM WAS
DISRUPTED FOR A SECOND TIME.

543
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,750
IT HAPPENED NEAR THE STEPS
OF THE MASAKI SHRINE.

544
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,791
THAT'S WHERE TENCHI FOUND
MAYUKA. NICE COINCIDENCE, HUH?

545
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,208
- COINCIDENCE? NO.

546
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:48,208
THAT IS WHY I CAME
TO SPEAK TO YOU, WASHU.

547
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,791
- WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

548
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:58,125
I KNOW THAT GIRL'S GOING
TO HURT TENCHI.

549
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:01,625
OR AM I JUST JEALOUS OF HER?
IT'S SO HARD TO KNOW.

550
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,916
- RYOKO?
- HUH?

551
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,125
- DO YOU MIND
IF I JOIN YOU FOR A WHILE?

552
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:09,250
- OH SURE.
- I HAVE TO ADMIT I'M JEALOUS.

553
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:13,208
IT HURTS ME SO MUCH THAT I CAN'T
EVEN BEAR TO LOOK AT TENCHI.

554
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:16,791
I THOUGHT I WAS MATURE ENOUGH
TO HANDLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

555
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:19,166
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IF EVER
TENCHI FELL IN LOVE

556
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,291
WITH SOMEONE ELSE,
I'D JUST GO BACK HOME.

557
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,416
BACK TO MY PLANET
AND MY PALACE

558
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,833
AND I'D NEVER SAY
A WORD ABOUT IT.

559
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,791
ISN'T IT STRANGE THAT I'M
TELLING YOU ALL THIS, RYOKO?

560
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:32,708
- DON'T BE FOOLISH, AYEKA.
YOU THINK TOO MUCH.

561
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,041
TENCHI WOULD NEVER BREAK
YOUR HEART, AYEKA.

562
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,291
AND SASAMI'D LAUGH
IF SHE SAW YOU NOW.

563
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,250
- RYOKO, HONESTLY?

564
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,416
- DON'T GET ALL WEEPY NOW.
I HATE THAT.

565
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,416
I REFUSE TO BE
A TIMID LITTLE MAIDEN.

566
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,625
I WANT TO HAVE FUN, AYEKA.
( laughs )

567
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,458
YOU KNOW, THEY ALL
LOVE YOU SO MUCH

568
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:49,708
THEY'LL SEND A SEARCH PARTY
FOR YOU PRETTY SOON.

569
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:52,333
- Sasami: AYEKA!
- SASAMI!

570
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,375
- SEE, DID I CALL IT OR WHAT?

571
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,666
- HERE.

572
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,500
- FATHER'S GOING TO LET US
LIGHT FIRECRACKERS.

573
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:00,041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?
HAVE YOU SEEN RYOKO?

574
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,625
- SHE WAS JUST HERE.
I GUESS SHE WENT HOME.

575
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:06,208
- COME ON, HURRY! EVERYONE'S
ASKING ABOUT YOU, AYEKA.

576
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:08,958
- YOU AND YOUR FIRECRACKERS.
- ( giggles )

577
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,375
- ( pops )
- ( yelps )

578
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,000
- OH, DID IT BURN YOUR HAND?
LET ME SEE IT.

579
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,541
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
WITH FIREWORKS.

580
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,500
YOU MUST NEVER TOUCH THEM
ONCE THEY'RE LIT, OKAY?

581
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,791
- SAYS WHO?!
- WHAT?

582
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,916
- SORRY.
- UH, YEAH.

583
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,083
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MAYUKA?
- YES, I'M FINE, SASAMI.

584
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,083
- ( laughing )

585
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,708
- THIS IS FOR YOU.

586
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:54,291
- WOW.

587
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,833
THAT'S AMAZING!

588
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:59,083
BEAUTIFUL.

589
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:02,291
- ( laughs )
WE CAN PLAY WITH IT TOGETHER.

590
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:05,125
JUST YOU AND ME IN MY ROOM.
- HUH?

591
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:08,291
- I HAVE THINGS THAT ARE
EVEN MORE FUN THAN THIS.

592
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,541
LOTS MORE FUN.
- REALLY?

593
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,541
- YEAH, COME ON, LET'S GO.

594
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,583
- OKAY.

595
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,958
- DEPART, YOU WICKED CREATURE!

596
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,666
- ( screaming )

597
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,000
BURN IT ALL NOW, MAYUKA!

598
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,250
- MM-HMM.

599
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:49,041
- All: OH!
- Sasami: LOOK, IT'S SO PRETTY.

600
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,041
- All: OH!
- ( cackles )

601
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,291
- MAYUKA, STOP IT!
WATCH OUT!

602
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:03,916
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

603
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,500
- THERE!
- MAYUKA.

604
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:10,291
- UH...
- MAYUKA!

605
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,125
- MAYUKA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

606
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:14,250
- CAREFUL WITH HER.
- ( groans )

607
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,375
MY HEAD-- AH!

608
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:19,083
- I'LL GET A BED READY FOR HER,
TENCHI. SHE NEEDS TO LIE DOWN.

609
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,875
YOU BRING HER IN.
- RIGHT.

610
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:23,291
WHY DON'T WE GO
INSIDE NOW, MAYUKA?

611
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,375
- YOU AREN'T HURT OR ANYTHING,
ARE YOU, MAYUKA?

612
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,125
- HMM-MM.
- HMMM.

613
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,875
SO YOU'RE THINKING
THE SAME THING I AM.

614
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:32,500
- RIGHT. RYOKO FELT
A DARK PRESENCE AS I DID.

615
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,791
SHE'S JEALOUS, BUT THAT'S
NOT THE WHOLE STORY.

616
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,583
THIS GIRL HAS HER SIGHTS SET.
- AND THE TARGET?

617
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,875
- TENCHI, I WOULD THINK.
- SO THIS GIRL IS...

618
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,375
- A POTENTIAL KILLER.
- SHE'S AN ASSASSIN!

619
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:46,458
- I LOVE TO RATTLE YOUR CAGE.
( laughing )

620
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,333
- NOT FUNNY!
NOW HOW ARE WE GONNA STOP IT?

621
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,083
- AH-- YOU'RE
SO SERIOUS, WASHU.

622
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,208
WE ARE JUST GOING TO GO ON
AS IF NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.

623
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,708
- HUH?

624
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:56,041
- WHOEVER PRODUCED THAT SILVER
HAIR WILL SHOW UP IN TIME.

625
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,458
IT'S A WAITING GAME
TILL THEN.

626
00:32:58,541 --> 00:32:59,958
MMM.

627
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,208
( laughs )

628
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:07,041
- Mayuka: I DON'T KNOW WHAT
CAME OVER ME. I'M SORRY.

629
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,250
- Ayeka: IT'S OKAY.
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER NOW?

630
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,791
- WELL, I-- I--

631
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,333
I'M AFRAID OF MYSELF.

632
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,708
- Sasami: HUH?
- ( sighs )

633
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,791
- MAYUKA, IT'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

634
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:20,166
- MISS AYEKA?
- YES?

635
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,291
- THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME OUT.
- OH.

636
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,291
SURE.

637
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,333
- HEY, SASAMI, YOU WERE TALKING

638
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:28,250
ABOUT SOMETHING
CALLED CHRISTMAS.

639
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,166
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.
- OH YEAH, I FORGOT.

640
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,208
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT CHRISTMAS IS, DO YOU?

641
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:34,375
- HUH-UH. IS IT
A LOT LIKE STARTICA?

642
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,166
- UH, WELL, STARTICA
IS IN SUMMER

643
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,041
AND CHRISTMAS IS IN WINTER.

644
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,000
HEY, I KNOW!
I COULD SHOW YOU!

645
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,166
THESE ARE THE CHRISTMAS PICTURES
FROM LAST YEAR.

646
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,958
- AH! THAT REALLY
LOOKS LIKE LOTS OF FUN.

647
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,750
- IT IS.
- GEE, WHAT'S THIS PICTURE?

648
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:52,125
- THAT'S THE CAKE I BAKED
WITH MY SISTER AYEKA.

649
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:55,416
IT WAS REALLY DELICIOUS.

650
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,833
Kiyone:
OH NO, LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.

651
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:00,791
- Sasami: FATHER'S EYES
ARE SHINY-- DANGEROUS.

652
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,833
- WHO'S THAT?
- RYOKO.

653
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,708
WHEN SHE DRINKS A LOT
SHE LOOKS LIKE THIS.

654
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:08,875
AND THIS.
- SHE'S HOPELESS.

655
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,750
- ( Mayuka laughs )
THEY LOOK FUNNY.

656
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,916
- Mihoshi: LOOK, TENCHI'S
JACKET HAS STAINS ON IT.

657
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,916
- Kiyone: I THINK YOU'RE THE ONE

658
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,041
WHO SPILLED JUICE
ON IT, MIHOSHI.

659
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,791
- DID I DO THAT?
( giggles )

660
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:21,791
- Mayuka: HEY, THAT LOOKS LIKE
THE TREES AT STARTICA.

661
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:22,916
- Sasami: IT'S A CHRISTMAS TREE.

662
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,791
THEY KINDA LOOK THE
SAME, DON'T THEY?

663
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,791
- Mayuka: IT'S SO PRETTY.

664
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:31,875
( giggles )
IT'S NICE. EVERYONE'S SO HAPPY.

665
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,375
WISH I WAS A PART OF IT TOO.
- YOU DO?

666
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,833
- YOU CAN IF YOU WISH TO.

667
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:38,875
YOU CAN JOIN OUR FAMILY
AND BE ONE OF US.

668
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:41,458
AND WE ALWAYS CELEBRATE
CHRISTMAS TOGETHER.

669
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:43,000
- YAH!
- YIPPEE!

670
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,958
- THAT'S GREAT.
- YEAH, I'M ALL FOR IT.

671
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,458
- ALL RIGHT.

672
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:48,875
- IT'S NOT UNTIL
WINTER, YOU KNOW,

673
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:51,291
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO BE
A VERY GOOD GIRL UNTIL THEN.

674
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,625
- OKAY!

675
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,958
- REMEMBER, IF YOU'RE THE
DAUGHTER OF LORD TENCHI

676
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,541
THEN YOU MUST ACT LIKE IT--
LIKE A PRINCESS.

677
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00,750
- I'M SO HAPPY, I WISH I COULD
JUST STAY HERE FOREVER.

678
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,958
- UM, RYOKO, UH...

679
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,291
I SEE, SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING.

680
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,416
- DON'T COME NEAR ME.

681
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,541
- I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID.

682
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,416
THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR IT.
I WAS WRONG.

683
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,583
I CAN'T ABANDON HER, RYOKO.
ISN'T THAT STRANGE?

684
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,583
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO SHE IS
OR WHERE SHE'S FROM,

685
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:24,000
BUT I KEEP FEELING
LIKE SHE'S TRAPPED--

686
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,750
LIKE SHE'S CAUGHT UP
IN SOMETHING

687
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,958
AND SHE HERSELF DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS.

688
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,375
SHE'S LIKE ME IN A WAY.

689
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:31,833
I LOST MY MOTHER WHEN I
WAS A LITTLE BOY.

690
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:34,916
AND MY PAST IS FULL OF MYSTERIES
JUST LIKE HERS IS.

691
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,250
- TENCHI, YOU'RE IN DANGER!

692
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:39,208
- YOU DON'T NEED TO
WORRY ABOUT ME.

693
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:41,250
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW I HAVE ACCESS

694
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,083
TO THE LIGHTHAWK SWORD
TO PROTECT ME.

695
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,833
COME TO THINK OF IT, RYOKO,

696
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,708
WHAT WAS THAT SWORD SHE USED
WHEN SHE WAS FIGHTING WITH YOU?

697
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,750
- IT WASN'T THE LIGHTHAWK SWORD,
I CAN SURE TELL YOU THAT!

698
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,916
OH YEAH, I SUPPOSE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

699
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,208
WHAT IF SHE REALLY DID
TURN OUT TO BE MY DAUGHTER?

700
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,625
- I SAID YOU'RE IN DANGER
AND YOU'RE LAUGHING?!

701
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,833
- SORRY.

702
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:02,791
- I'M FRIGHTENED FOR YOU.

703
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,833
IF YOU EVER...

704
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,458
- IF I EVER WHAT?

705
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,416
YOU WORRY TOO MUCH.

706
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,416
I NEVER KNEW YOU WERE
SUCH A WORRIER, HUH?

707
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,583
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE FINE, RYOKO, YOU'LL SEE.

708
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,166
IT'S KINDA
CHILLY UP HERE, ISN'T IT?

709
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,000
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK IN
AND GET SOME SLEEP, HMM?

710
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,208
- HUH-UH.
- PLEASE.

711
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:26,625
- ( sighs )

712
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,916
- ( whimpering )

713
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,916
- WHO TOLD YOU TO MAKE
FRIENDS WITH THEM?

714
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,208
THIS ISN'T A PARTY.

715
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:44,500
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT
I TELL YOU, PERIOD.

716
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:49,000
NOW YOU GET UP AND YOU
BRING THAT PRINCE TO ME!

717
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:52,208
AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT, MAYUKA,
OR I'LL DESTROY YOU!

718
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,791
- ( moans )
DADDY!

719
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:15,458
DADDY? I'M REALLY SCARED, DADDY.
- ( soft snores )

720
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:25,083
- ALL RIGHT, HE'S IN A TRANCE,
NOW DO IT.

721
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:29,416
- I WILL OBEY YOU.

722
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,458
- ( groaning )

723
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:58,125
- ( cackles )
I'VE GOT YOU NOW.

724
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,208
- TENCHI!
- ( gasps ) YOSHO!

725
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:03,125
- YUZUHA!
- WELL, LONG TIME NO SEE.

726
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:06,625
I'M TAKING YOUR PRINCE WITH ME.
- I CAN'T PERMIT THAT.

727
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,625
YAH YAH!

728
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:11,250
I MISSED!
- TENCHI!

729
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:17,750
- ( gasps )
WHAT? DADDY!

730
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,875
- Ryoko: WHO WAS THAT CREATURE?
- WHAT?

731
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,666
- I'LL ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME.
JUST WHO WAS IT?

732
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,791
- I DON'T KNOW.
- STOP THAT, RYOKO.

733
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,791
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

734
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,708
- ( moaning )
- WHAT?

735
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:32,166
( yelps )
MAYUKA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

736
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,708
- ( sobbing )
I DON'T KNOW, DADDY.

737
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,708
SHE GRABBED ME.

738
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,125
- RYOKO! AHH!
- Katsuhito: TENCHI!

739
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,916
YOU MUSTN'T BLAME
RYOKO FOR THIS.

740
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,250
- WHAT WERE YOU PLANNING
TO DO WITH OUR TENCHI?

741
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,500
WHERE WERE YOU TAKING HIM?

742
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,041
- I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS!

743
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,000
LET ME GO!
- MAYUKA!

744
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,875
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- WAIT, TENCHI!

745
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,666
TENCHI, TENCHI,
YOU CAN'T LEAVE!

746
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,791
YOU MUSTN'T. ( sobbing )
- RYOKO?

747
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:00,833
- Ayeka: WHERE'D MAYUKA GO?

748
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,166
- Washu: MIHOSHI AND KIYONE
ARE OUT LOOKING FOR HER.

749
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,916
- THE DOMAIN
OF DARKNESS, GRANDPA?

750
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,708
- THAT IS CORRECT, TENCHI.

751
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,333
- IT'S NOT MAYUKA'S FAULT!
SHE'S UNDER A SPELL!

752
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:10,541
PLEASE, IT'S NOT FAIR!

753
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,333
- EVEN IF SHE IS CONTROLLED
BY SOMEONE ELSE,

754
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,208
SHE'S OUR ENEMY,
YOU KNOW THAT.

755
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,416
OUR ONLY CHOICE IS TO TAKE
HER OUT, IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

756
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,041
- SIMPLE YOU SAY?
IT'S NOT SIMPLE AT ALL.

757
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:22,041
SHE'S CONTROLLED FROM DEEP
WITHIN BY A DEMON NAMED YUZUHA.

758
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,333
MAYUKA'S FULL
OF SWEETNESS AND LIGHT,

759
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,083
BUT THE DEMON TWISTS IT
INTO EVIL,

760
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,708
LURKING IN THE DARK DOMAIN
OF AN ANCIENT NIGHTMARE.

761
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:31,166
YUZUHA HAS COMPLETE
POWER OVER HER.

762
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,333
- GENETICALLY SHE REALLY
IS TENCHI'S DAUGHTER,

763
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:37,250
BUT ALSO SHE IS THE CHILD
OF A MYSTERIOUS UNDERWORLD.

764
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,833
- UNDERWORLD? OH MY!
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHY

765
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,916
WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO SAVE HER!

766
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,916
YOU'RE SO CRUEL, RYOKO!
- SASAMI!

767
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,541
- I PROMISED MAYUKA
THAT SHE COULD

768
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,625
SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH ALL OF US!

769
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:51,333
I'M GOING TO FIND HER
AND KEEP THAT PROMISE!

770
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:54,250
- STOP! WAIT, SASAMI, WAIT!

771
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:56,083
- I'LL GO FIND HER MYSELF.
- LISTEN TO ME.

772
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:57,958
- HUH?
- MAYUKA WILL COME BACK.

773
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,916
HER MISSION IS TO DESTROY YOU.
BE ON GUARD.

774
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,833
- RIGHT.

775
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:04,875
- HEY, MAYUKA, WHERE ARE YOU?

776
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,916
- WAIT, SASAMI!
( yelps )

777
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,750
- HELLO, SASAMI!
AYEKA, IT'S ME!

778
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:17,500
- ( gasps )

779
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:27,666
- JUST BRING THE PRINCE TO ME

780
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,875
OR YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL DO!

781
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,500
- I KNOW WHAT SHE'LL DO.

782
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:35,958
SHE'LL DESTROY ME.
( moans )

783
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,750
I'M SCARED.
HELP ME, DADDY!

784
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:40,750
WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?
WHAT DID I DO?

785
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,458
( sobs )
WHY DOES IT HURT ME?

786
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:48,333
WHY DOES MY HEART ACHE SO
WHEN I THINK ABOUT YOU, DADDY?

787
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:51,500
( gasps )
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

788
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,541
- I CLONED YOU
TO CARRY OUT A MISSION,

789
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,583
NOT TO HAVE FEELINGS
AND EMOTIONS.

790
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:58,500
JUST FOR THAT, I'M GOING
TO ERASE YOUR MEMORY BANKS.

791
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,833
YAH!

792
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,791
- ( screams )

793
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:09,208
- MAYUKA!

794
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,875
YOU MUST BE YUZUHA.

795
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:14,458
YOU LEAVE MAYUKA ALONE.
HEY, WAIT!

796
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:16,208
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- Ayeka: OH NO!

797
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:17,750
- AYEKA, HELP!

798
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:20,416
- ( grunting )

799
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,916
- ( screams )

800
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,250
- HANG ON, AYEKA.
- AYEKA!

801
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,333
- AYEKA!

802
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,958
- Yuzuha: PRINCE, I'M
WAITING FOR YOU.

803
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:31,791
FIND ME. ASK THE OLD MAN
FROM THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

804
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,208
( laughs )

805
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,541
- HOLD IT!
- TENCHI, HELP ME! ( screams )

806
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:37,458
- ( cackles )

807
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,958
- THIS FIELD IS VERY UNSTABLE.

808
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,833
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T
GUARANTEE YOUR WAY BACK.

809
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:52,833
- I KNOW.

810
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:54,916
- AND YOU, RYOKO?
- UNDERSTOOD.

811
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,833
- YOU'LL BE FIGHTING HER
ON HER OWN TURF

812
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:59,333
AND YOUR JURAI POWERS
MAY NOT WORK IN HER WORLD.

813
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,125
- RIGHT.
- I'M SURE BY NOW

814
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,875
SHE'S BROUGHT MAYUKA ALL THE WAY
INTO THE DARKNESS.

815
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:06,541
- PLEASE COME BACK TO US,
BOTH OF YOU.

816
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,166
- YES, BE CAREFUL.
- WE WILL, DON'T WORRY.

817
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,375
- PLEASE, TENCHI,
FIND SASAMI.

818
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:14,916
- WE'LL BRING HER BACK, AYEKA.
- YOU CAN COUNT ON US.

819
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,291
- RYOKO, IT'S TIME THAT WE WENT.
- YEAH.

820
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,291
- ( both grunt )

821
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,333
( screaming )

822
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:32,166
- Bear: OOOH!

823
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:35,333
- ( voices moaning, hooting )

824
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:39,750
- WHOA!
- ( moans )

825
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,333
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, RYOKO?

826
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:43,208
- YEAH SURE,
I'M JUST SWELL, TENCHI.

827
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:46,083
( shouts ) WHAT KIND OF
PLACE IS THIS ANYWAY?

828
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:48,875
- A LITTLE BIZARRE. I MEAN,
THERE'S NOTHING HERE BUT TOYS.

829
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:51,208
- Bear: MERRY CHRISTMAS...
- Both: HUH?

830
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:52,375
- ...TO THE PRINCE OF JURAI

831
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:54,583
AND HIS DOUBLE PRINCESS
AND SPACE PIRATE.

832
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:57,291
WELCOME TO THE LAND
OF YUZUHA.

833
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,708
- HEY, THOSE TOYS ARE ALIVE!
- IT'S JUST AN ILLUSION.

834
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:04,250
HEY, WE WANT TO TALK TO YUZUHA
OR WHATEVER HER NAME IS.

835
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:07,583
- YUZUHA IS GETTING READY
FOR THE BIG CHRISTMAS PARTY.

836
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:10,750
BUT SHE ASKED US TO GIVE YOU
A SPECIAL GREETING!

837
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:13,000
- ( all laughing )
- YAH!

838
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,333
- TRY IT. HAH!

839
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,125
- DID WE SCARE YOU?
DID WE HURT YOU?

840
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:34,416
I'M SO SORRY!

841
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,208
- COME ON, TENCHI, WE'VE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE FAST!

842
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:38,916
HUH?
- ( both screaming )

843
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,708
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.

844
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:49,791
- HUH?
- WHAT'S THAT?

845
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:53,416
- AM I CRAZY
OR WEREN'T WE JUST FALLING?

846
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,166
- I THINK SO.
- Mayuka: LOOK OVER HERE.

847
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,041
- Tenchi: SASAMI!
- Ryoko: IT'S YOU!

848
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:02,125
- DADDY, YOU CAME
TO MY CHRISTMAS PARTY.

849
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,833
THANK YOU.
- Tenchi: MAYUKA?

850
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,833
- DON'T LET HER FOOL YOU.
LOOK AT HER EYES!

851
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:09,041
HA!
- RYOKO IS THE FOOL!

852
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:12,041
- IS THAT RIGHT?

853
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,375
- ( grunting )

854
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:33,416
- ( yelps )
- HAD ENOUGH?

855
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,166
- ( gasps ) THE LIGHTHAWK SWORD!
- MAYUKA!

856
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,208
- WHO'S THAT?

857
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:58,125
- TAKE A GUESS. NICE TO SEE
YOU. WELCOME TO MY DOMAIN.

858
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,250
- Ryoko: IT'S THE DEMON!

859
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,208
- RIGHT. AND FORGET
YOUR LIGHT SWORD.

860
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:04,041
THAT DOESN'T WORK DOWN HERE.
I KNOW IT'S NOT THE SEASON,

861
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,750
BUT I HOPE YOU ENJOYED MY LITTLE
CHRISTMAS PRESENT ANYWAY.

862
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,500
I DID.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US?

863
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:11,541
- OH, DON'T YOU KNOW,
MY DEAR SILLY PRINCE OF JURAI?

864
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,083
WHY, I JUST WANT TO PLAY
WITH YOU A BIT, THAT'S ALL.

865
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:17,041
- LISTEN, YOU LITTLE WEASEL!
WE'RE NOT YOUR PLAYTHINGS.

866
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,458
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US?
- I'LL NEVER TELL.

867
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:21,041
THAT'S TOO EASY.

868
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:23,375
BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO GET LUCKY
AND MAKE IT BACK IN ONE PIECE,

869
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,541
ASK YOUR GRANDFATHER.
- WHAT? MY GRANDFATHER?

870
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,750
- ( both gasp )

871
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,666
- LET THE PARTY BEGIN!

872
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,458
- ( growls )
TENCHI!

873
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:48,625
( yelps )

874
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,166
- ( both yell )

875
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,250
( grunts )

876
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,583
- Tenchi: UH-OH.
- ( both groaning )

877
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:04,083
- Yuzuha: THIS IS FUN.
WE CAN PLAY AS LONG AS WE LIKE

878
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:06,458
BECAUSE THERE'S NO TIME
IN MY WORLD.

879
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:08,166
- TENCHI!
- ( screaming )

880
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,000
- GOTCHA!
YAHOO!

881
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,541
- ( roars )
- DAMN YOU!

882
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,125
- ARE YOU HURT?
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

883
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,750
IT'S JUST A LITTLE SCRATCH.
AHHH!

884
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:26,666
- RYOKO, WAKE UP, WAKE UP!

885
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,750
- Ayeka: TENCHI'S POWERS WON'T
WORK IN THE NIGHTMARE WORLD?

886
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:31,000
- Katsuhito: THAT IS CORRECT.

887
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:33,333
- Ayeka: THAT MEANS THE
LIGHTHAWK SWORD IS...

888
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,583
- Washu: COMPLETELY USELESS,
I'M AFRAID.

889
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:36,625
- OH NO.

890
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:38,125
- Katsuhito: YUZUHA
IS THE SPIRIT

891
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:41,750
OF THE TREE OF DARKNESS. IF ONLY
WE HAD THE TREE OF LIGHT.

892
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,250
- TREE OF LIGHT?

893
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,166
- THE TREE THAT CREATED THE
JURAI ROYAL FAMILY--

894
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,875
"TSUNAMI."

895
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:50,333
- WAIT, WE HAVE
A ROYAL TREE RIGHT HERE.

896
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:52,208
THE TREE THAT BELONGED
TO MY BROTHER.

897
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:57,166
THAT'S THE BEST HOPE WE HAVE.

898
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:01,708
- RYOKO, HANG ON.
- ( cackles )

899
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:02,958
- PRINCE OF LIGHT,

900
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:05,375
YOU WON'T LAST LONG IN MY
WORLD OF DARKNESS.

901
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:06,791
- SHOW YOURSELF!

902
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:09,458
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR FRIEND HAS
EXHAUSTED HER POWERS.

903
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:11,541
DOESN'T IT?
- WHY DID YOU BRING US HERE?

904
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:14,583
- 'CAUSE THIS IS WHERE I CREATED
MAYUKA OUT OF YOUR BLACK HAIR

905
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:17,125
AND MY SILVER HAIR.
- SO HER LIGHTHAWK SWORD WAS...

906
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:20,541
- A FAKE, OF COURSE.
YOU FELL FOR IT NICELY.

907
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,916
YEAH, MAYBE I'LL JUST MELT
YOU AND RYOKO TOGETHER

908
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,291
LIKE I MELTED THOSE HAIRS.

909
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,708
RYOKO'D ENJOY THAT SINCE SHE'S
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

910
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:29,500
( cackles )
- Ryoko: AH, GO ON, DO IT!

911
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:32,666
IF IT'LL FEED YOUR PITIFUL
LITTLE EGO, GO RIGHT AHEAD.

912
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,416
I'D LOVE TO BE
JOINED WITH TENCHI.

913
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,041
- HEY, MAYUKA!

914
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:38,416
SHALL WE DESTROY
RYOKO OR SASAMI FIRST?

915
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,125
- NO, STOP!
LEAVE HER ALONE.

916
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:42,000
- I COULD USE MY
DISINTEGRATION TECHNIQUE,

917
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:44,416
BUT I PREFER THE PURPLE CLAW!

918
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,375
- LET'S MAKE A DEAL.
I'LL STAY HERE

919
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:48,958
IF YOU'LL JUST SEND RYOKO
AND SASAMI BACK TO OUR WORLD.

920
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,000
- I WON'T GO.

921
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,250
- LISTEN PLEASE,
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

922
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,208
- ( moaning )

923
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,666
- EASY, MAYUKA,
WHAT'S YOUR RUSH?

924
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,000
IT'S NO FUN
IF YOU KILL HIM TOO SOON.

925
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:08,375
I WANT SOME ENTERTAINMENT HERE.

926
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,416
- ( Tenchi screaming )
- ( gasps )

927
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:15,583
STOP IT!

928
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:19,291
- MY MY, THE LITTLE PRINCESS
FINALLY WOKE UP.

929
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:22,041
HAVE A NICE NAP?
- IS THAT MAYUKA?

930
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:25,500
- THAT'S MAYUKA. SHE'S LOST
HER HUMAN SIDE, SASAMI.

931
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,416
- OH, NO, WAIT!

932
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,375
- ( growling )
- HAVING FUN WITH YOUR DADDY?

933
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:34,625
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MISS
MAYUKA? WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS!

934
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:37,458
TENCHI'S YOUR DADDY.
WE'RE YOUR FAMILY, REMEMBER?

935
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:44,166
YOU MUSTN'T HURT YOUR FAMILY,
MAYUKA. WE ALL LOVE YOU!

936
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,791
- DADDY?

937
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:01,791
DADDY!
- CAN'T BE!

938
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:05,083
- ( sobbing ) DADDY.

939
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:06,791
- MAYUKA?
- SORRY.

940
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:08,416
- YOU BROKE THROUGH TO HER.

941
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,375
MAYUKA'S COME OUT
OF THE DARKNESS INTO THE LIGHT.

942
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,916
- MAYUKA!

943
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,791
- TENCHI!

944
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:18,333
- YOU FOOL.
THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL GET

945
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:20,500
FOR YOUR FOND MEMORIES.
- ( screams )

946
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,041
- YOU MAY HAVE A HUMAN HEART,
BUT I CREATED YOU

947
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,083
AND YOU'LL FOLLOW MY COMMANDS!

948
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:28,333
ARE YOU GETTING A CHARGE
OUT OF THIS, DEARIE?

949
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:29,583
- OH, MAYUKA.

950
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,291
- YUZUHA'S REGAINING
CONTROL AGAIN.

951
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:33,791
- Yuzuha: THAT'S BETTER,
NOW USE THOSE CLAWS!

952
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,166
( gasps )

953
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:40,416
YOU DARE TO ATTACK
YOUR CREATOR?

954
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,416
- YUZUHA'S YUZUHA
AND MAYUKA'S MAYUKA.

955
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,750
I DON'T WANT STARTICA ANYMORE.
I WANT CHRISTMAS.

956
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:50,416
MY DADDY AND SASAMI
AND EVERYBODY WILL BE THERE.

957
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,875
I'LL BE A GOOD GIRL
AND WAIT FOR WINTER TO COME

958
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,833
SO I CAN HAVE CHRISTMAS
WITH MY FAMILY.

959
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:57,500
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE HERE
IN THE DARKNESS ANYMORE.

960
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:59,500
- ALL RIGHT,
THEN YOU WON'T LIVE ANYWHERE!

961
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,333
YOUR CODES ARE CANCELED!
- ( screaming )

962
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:07,916
- MAYUKA!
- Sasami: NO!

963
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:11,583
- DADDY?

964
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,958
I'M SORRY I DID THINGS
THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE.

965
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,916
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU COULDN'T HELP IT.

966
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,208
- I WAS BAD.
I MADE RYOKO ANGRY.

967
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:20,791
BUT I LOVE RYOKO.

968
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:22,833
I HOPE THAT SHE
FORGIVES ME, DADDY.

969
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:24,833
- OF COURSE I DO.
HANG IN THERE.

970
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:26,625
- MAYUKA, DON'T GO AWAY!

971
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:28,958
- SASAMI, IT'S YOU.

972
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:31,375
WE'LL CELEBRATE
CHRISTMAS TOGETHER, YOU AND ME

973
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:33,833
AND DADDY
AND ALL THE ONES THAT I LOVE.

974
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,583
- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HER?

975
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:40,250
MAYUKA, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO AWAY!

976
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:43,333
NO, MAYUKA, PLEASE!

977
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:46,541
NO, LET ME GO!
SHE'S MY FRIEND-- MAYUKA!

978
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:49,041
( sobbing )
- ( chimes )

979
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,166
- DID YOU ENJOY PLAYING
WITH THAT GIRL'S LIFE? DID YOU?

980
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,333
SHE WAS JUST A CLONE,

981
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:03,958
AN EXPERIMENT I DID
WHEN I WAS BORED.

982
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,166
- Tenchi: SHE WAS FULL
OF SPIRIT AND HOPE.

983
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,708
- SHE WAS JUST A BUNCH
OF ENCODED DNA, THAT'S ALL.

984
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:11,250
- HALF OF IT WAS
YOUR DNA, YUZUHA.

985
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,208
MAYUKA WAS AS MUCH YOU
AS SHE WAS ME.

986
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:14,333
- ( grunts )

987
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:16,333
- YOU KILLED PART OF
YOURSELF, YUZUHA,

988
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,416
AND IT WAS THE BEST PART.

989
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,708
- THE BEST PART OF
ME'S ALREADY DEAD.

990
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,291
JURAIANS!

991
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,708
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY DID TO ME!

992
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,833

SOME INFERIOR BEAST.

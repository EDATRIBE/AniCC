1
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,916
- ( instrumental music playing )

2
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,958
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

3
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,916
- YES.

4
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,625
( coughing )

5
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,250
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

6
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,375
- ( coughing continues )

7
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,458
YOSHO.

8
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,625
- Yosho: I WILL
ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

9
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,250
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

10
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,375
- WOW.
( laughs )

11
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,083
IT'S LIKE A CARPET 
OF CHERRY BLOSSOMS,

12
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,000
BUT THEN IT WOULD BE
A WHOLE LOT OF WORK 

13
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,333
TO CLEAN ALL OF THIS UP.
DON'T YOU THINK?

14
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,166
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO.

15
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,750
SO LET'S GO.
THE LONGER YOU WAIT,

16
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:34,916
THE HARDER IT GETS,
YOU KNOW?

17
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,875
- HMM.  CAMELLIAS.

18
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:52,000
AS THE OPENING OF SPRING
MAKES THIS OLD MAN'S HEART SING,

19
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,666
I FEEL THE BEAUTY
OF THE HOURS

20
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,375
AS THE CAMELLIA BLOOMING FLOWER

21
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,500
FLOATS BY ON GOSSAMER WINGS.

22
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,416
- Ryoko: COME ON!
GIVE IT HERE!

23
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,125
- Ayeka:
WHY SHOULD I?!  IT'S MINE.

24
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,041
- OH, RIGHT.  YOU'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING WITH IT. 

25
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,708
YOU'RE JUST HOGGING IT. 
- WHAT I'M DOING WITH IT

26
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,083
IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
- OH, YEAH?!

27
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,000
- ( both straining )

28
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,625
- HEE HEE!
- ( screams )

29
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,291
- I'M SO SORRY.

30
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,083
IT WASN'T ON PURPOSE,
I SWEAR.

31
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,291
- ( growls )

32
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,541
( grunting )

33
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,625
( laughs )
OH, PARDON ME.

34
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,958
I DIDN'T DO THAT
ON PURPOSE EITHER.

35
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,708
- YOU BITCH!
- OOH!  HA HA!

36
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,500
OH, YOU WANT TO FIGHT ME,
DO YOU?

37
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,250
- Ryoko: WHAT DID YOU THINK?
- OH, NO.

38
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,791
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
BE DRIVING A SPACE--

39
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,708
- RYOKO, AYEKA, DON'T
YOU EVER GET ENOUGH?

40
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,958
- ( growls )

41
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,625
TENCHI, AYEKA
STEPPED ON MY FOOT

42
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,000
'CAUSE SHE'S JEALOUS!  UGH!
- I'M SURE.

43
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,625
SHE TOOK MY BROOM FROM ME
SO I TAUGHT HER

44
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,208
A LITTLE LESSON IN COURTESY.
- THAT BROOM

45
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,416
WAS LYING ON THE GROUND,
PRINCESS AIRHEAD!

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,416
- LOOK HOW YOU
TWIST THINGS AROUND!

47
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
- I LEFT IT THERE
TO GIVE IT A REST, YOU TROLL!

48
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,291
- RYOKO, YOU JUST NEVER
KNOW WHEN TO LET UP.

49
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,291
- WHAT?  ARE YOU SAYING THIS 
WHOLE THING WAS MY FAULT NOW?

50
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,416
- Tenchi: NO, I'M
NOT BLAMING YOU.

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,750
- OH, SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT
IT WAS MY FAULT THEN, TENCHI?

52
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,000
- I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
- Ryoko: MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

53
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,458
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?
- WHOSE SIDE?

54
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,000
- Ayeka: SHE'S RIGHT.
IT'S ABOUT TIME

55
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,791
YOU CHOOSE BETWEEN US
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

56
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,291
NOW WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?

57
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,375
- YOU CAN TAKE
THE LOVELY PRINCESS

58
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,458
OR THE UGLY OGRE.
IT'S UP TO YOU. BUT CHOOSE.

59
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,791
- CHOOSE THE TWIT!
I DARE YOU!

60
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,333
- I'M TRYING TO FIND
THE LOGIC HERE.

61
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,250
- LOGIC HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

62
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,625
YOU ARE INDECISIVE.
THAT'S THE WHOLE TROUBLE HERE.

63
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,458
JUST TELL MISS SPACE PIRATE
TO GO BACK TO THE DOG STAR.

64
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,708
AND SAY IT CLEARLY.

65
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,625
- HA!  THIS IS
THE PERFECT CHANCE

66
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,833
TO GET RID OF
THAT LITTLE DITZ.

67
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,958
- ( both growling )

68
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,375
- LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

69
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,250
- Both: HMPH!

70
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,333
COME ON, TENCHI.
YOU MUST DECIDE.

71
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,750
- EH-- AH-- OH.

72
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,333
AH, LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU.

73
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,833
IT'S A BEAR CHARGING DOWN
FROM THE MOUNTAIN.

74
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,458
- ( both gasp )
- HUH?

75
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,958
- Both: HUH?

76
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,166
WHAA--?!
- ( meows )

77
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,250
- TENCHI?

78
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,375
- Ryoko: TENCHI!

79
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,125
YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY
FOREVER!

80
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,166
- ( pants )

81
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,875
( sighs )

82
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,458
WHAT IS IT?
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS

83
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,458
HAVE TO PUT ME
ON THE SPOT THAT WAY?

84
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,291
OH.

85
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,750
HUH?  HMM.

86
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,208
OH, IT'S A CAMELLIA.

87
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,916
( gasps )

88
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,500
OH.

89
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,500
- TENCHI.

90
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,416
- ( gasps )

91
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,458
- COME HERE.

92
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,666
- Ryoko: TENCHI!

93
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,416
- Ayeka: LORD TENCHI!

94
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,958
- TENCHI!

95
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,625
- ( pants )

96
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,375
( sighs )

97
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,916
HUH?

98
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,333
- Ryoko: AND THAT'S
HOW IT HAPPENED.

99
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,291
TENCHI SIMPLY VANISHED
WITHOUT A TRACE.

100
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,416
- HMM.

101
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,916
- ( scanner beeps )

102
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,291
- ( sighs )
- Mihoshi: ISN'T WASHU AMAZING?

103
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,291
- HUH?

104
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,291
- A FAKE SCIENCE
ACADEMY I.D. CARD!

105
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,666
WHO WOULD EVER KNOW
IT WAS PHONY?

106
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,625
( laughing )

107
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,958
- MIHOSHI!  QUIET.
SHH!  NUH-UH.

108
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,041
- WHAT?  DID YOU SAY
 SOMETHING, KIYONE?!

109
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,875
- ( groans )
YOU ARE HOPELESS!

110
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,541
- ( meows )

111
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,541
- RYO-OHKI, THANKS
FOR THE RIDE HOME.

112
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,500
- Kamidake: PRINCESS.  PRINCESS.
- HUH?

113
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,833
- Both: HELLO.
WELCOME HOME TO JURAI.

114
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,375
- HMM, TO THE THRONE ROOM.

115
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,541
- Noboyuki: FATHER.

116
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,458
- NOBOYUKI.

117
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,166
- I JUST SAW THE POLICE

118
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,458
AND REPORTED TENCHI 
AS A MISSING PERSON.

119
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,833
- AH, I SEE.

120
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,375
- THE AUTUMN HAS COME.

121
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,750
- IT HAS BEEN SIX MONTHS.

122
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,291
- ( sighs )

123
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,708
SIX MONTHS AND NO WORD.

124
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,125
IF TENCHI WERE ALIVE,
HE WOULD HAVE CONTACTED US.

125
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,083
I CAN'T BEAR TO THINK
WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM.

126
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,416
- NOBOYUKI, TENCHI IS STRONG.

127
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,875
AND HE KNOWS
THE WAYS OF JURAI.

128
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,250
TRY TO HAVE FAITH.

129
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,000
BELIEVE IN TENCHI.

130
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,291
- YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

131
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,875
- ( distant chatter )

132
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,625
- MM-MM.

133
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,541
- ( sighs )

134
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,125
- NOT A SINGLE CLUE.

135
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,583
- WE'LL SEARCH.  YEP. 
WE'VE GOT WASHU'S ORB.

136
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:56,208
- Ayeka: I'LL BE YOUR WAITRESS.
CAN I TAKE YOUR ORDER?

137
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,250
- OH, WELL, LET ME SEE.

138
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,375
I THINK I'LL HAVE
A DOUBLE HAMBURGER

139
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,666
JAPANESE STYLE
WITH CHICKEN RISOTTO.

140
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,791
- YES, SIR.

141
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,000
ALL RIGHT THEN,
LET'S SEE

142
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,250
IF I HAVE THIS RIGHT.

143
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,875
YOU WOULD LIKE ONE
DOUBLE HAMBURGER

144
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,916
JAPANESE STYLE AND
ONE CHICKEN RISOTTO.

145
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,541
OH, AND WOULD YOU LIKE
ANYTHING TO DRINK WITH THAT?

146
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,916
WE HAVE FRESH-BREWED COFFEE,
WHICH IS VERY GOOD.

147
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,916
- Woman:
AFTER WE FINISH EATING.

148
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,500
- ( sighs )

149
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,333
TENCHI SHOULD BE
IN THIS AREA

150
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,916
ACCORDING TO WASHU.

151
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,333
WELL, I HOPE
THAT SHE'S RIGHT.

152
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,333
- RYOKO!
- ( gasps )

153
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,583
- I'LL DEDUCT IT 
FROM YOUR SALARY.

154
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,375
- ( groans )

155
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,958
- ( sighs )
I'M EXHAUSTED.

156
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,500
- THE BATHHOUSE 
CLOSES AT 10:00.

157
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,333
- I THINK I'LL PASS TONIGHT.

158
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,875
- I KNOW WE HAVE TO,
BUT HOLDING DOWN A JOB

159
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,500
WHILE WE SEARCH FOR TENCHI
IS SO DRAINING.

160
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,166
- WE'RE LUCKY THAT THEY HIRED US
WITHOUT REFERENCES.

161
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,916
EVERYBODY COMES
IN THERE TO TALK.

162
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,666
WE MIGHT GET SOME NEWS
ABOUT TENCHI.

163
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,041
- IF WE'RE LUCKY.

164
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,583
FALL IS HERE.

165
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,500
- YES, THE SEASONS
ARE CHANGING.

166
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,166
IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS SINCE...

167
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,333
- WE'VE TRAVELLED
TO SO MANY PLACES

168
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,708
LOOKING FOR TENCHI.

169
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,125
WELL, I THINK THAT EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO CHANGE

170
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,208
NOW THAT WE'RE HERE.

171
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,833
NOW WE HAVE
THE ORB AS WELL.

172
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,791
- WHY DON'T YOU CHECK IT?

173
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,291
- OH, IT'S TIME TO
CALL IN ANYWAY.

174
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,750
I ALMOST FORGOT.

175
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,583
- ( beeps )

176
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,416
- WHAT'S UP, GIRLFRIENDS?

177
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,041
ANY BIG CLUES?

178
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,041
- NOT EVEN A LITTLE CLUE.

179
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,833
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
HAVE SOMETHING.

180
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,833
- HMM, I DETECTED

181
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,625
SOME TEMPORAL ANOMALIES
AROUND HERE.

182
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,375
THEY MAY HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH TENCHI,

183
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,041
SO STAY IN THE AREA.

184
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,458
LET'S BE VIGILANT, LADIES.
- Ryoko: RIGHT.

185
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,666
( yawns )

186
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,541
WELL, LET'S GET 
SOME SLEEP, HUH?

187
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,541
- YES, WE'LL NEED AN 
EARLY START TOMORROW.

188
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,791
- RYOKO.

189
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,500
AYEKA!

190
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,500
WHERE AM I?

191
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,041
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.

192
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,625
WHAT KIND OF PLACE
IS THIS?

193
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,208
- ( clock ticking )
- ( groans )

194
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,125
( groans )

195
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,041
- ( chopping )
- ( grunts )

196
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,458
- WAKE UP NOW, TENCHI.
YOU'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

197
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,791
- ( groans )
- ( window opens )

198
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,333
- IT'S A LOVELY DAY.

199
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,875
( kisses )

200
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,625
ARE YOU AWAKE?

201
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:56,291
- UH,
YES, HARUNA, OF COURSE.

202
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,291
- OH, HARUNA.

203
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,333
HERE, TAKE SOME
FRESH PERSIMMONS.

204
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,500
- OH, THEY LOOK SO NICE.
THANK YOU.

205
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,750
- ( static )

206
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,958
- HERE YOU GO.

207
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,375
- DARN THING,
I CAN'T GET A PICTURE.

208
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,833
- MH-HMM.
SOUP WITH FRIED TOFU.

209
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,250
WELL, <i>BON APPETIT.</i>

210
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,250
MMM.

211
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,083
DELICIOUS.
- HERE, HAVE SOME MORE.

212
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,125
- OH, JEEZ,
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

213
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,708
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
I DON'T LIKE FERMENTED BEANS?

214
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,125
- DID YOU?
GUESS I FORGOT.

215
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,625
- WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

216
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,666
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.

217
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,500
- Washu: I NEED YOU TO
USE THE JURAI NETWORK.

218
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,541
YOU HAVE TENCHI'S
WAVE IMPRINT.

219
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,791
SEARCH FOR TRACES
IN THE TEMPORAL NETTING.

220
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,083
SASAMI, CAN YOU
DO THAT FOR ME?

221
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,541
- I'LL DO MY BEST.

222
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,333
- ( bus engine running )

223
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,500
- ( mutters sleepily )

224
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,625
- ARE YOU GONNA SNORE
THE WHOLE WAY, SLEEPING BEAUTY?

225
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,875
HOW ABOUT WAKING UP
FOR A WHILE

226
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,333
TO HELP ME LOOK 
FOR TENCHI, HUH?

227
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,625
- ( grunts )
SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

228
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,000
I COULDN'T GET
A WINK LAST NIGHT

229
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,333
'CAUSE YOU KEPT
TALKING IN YOUR SLEEP

230
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,958
LIKE A CHIPMUNK.

231
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,833
- I DO NOT TALK 
LIKE A CHIPMUNK.

232
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,583
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
ALWAYS GRINDS HER TEETH.

233
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,333
AND LAST NIGHT, 
YOU EVEN FARTED.

234
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,083
- RIGHT, LIKE
PRINCESSES NEVER DO.

235
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,041
- ( beeping )

236
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:34,083
- TENCHI IS NEARBY.
- RYOKO, I SEE TENCHI.

237
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,000
- Ryoko:
DRIVER, STOP THE BUS!

238
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,625
TENCHI!

239
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,208
( grunts, pants )

240
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,458
DARN!

241
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,541
VERY STRANGE.
- RYOKO?

242
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,333
- ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE
THAT WAS TENCHI?

243
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,250
- YES, BUT HE LOOKED DIFFERENT,
LIKE HE'D GROWN OLDER.

244
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,583
- Washu: YOU LOST HIM, HUH?

245
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,708
HMM?

246
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,541
- HE WAS RIGHT THERE

247
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,333
AND THEN HE JUST VANISHED
INTO THIN AIR.

248
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,958
- SOMETIMES TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS
CAN BE PARTIALLY INTERSECTED.

249
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,250
I'LL GO BACK AND
REVIEW THE DATA.

250
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,208
AND I'LL SEE IF
SASAMI'S PICKED ANYTHING UP.

251
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,166
- WAIT!  WASHU!  WASHU!

252
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,958
- WASHU, COME BACK!

253
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,166
- ( both sigh )

254
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,708
- AREN'T YOU GETTING COLD?
- MM-MM.

255
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,041
- YOU MUST BE TIRED.
- I'M FINE.

256
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,750
- WELL, THAT DOES IT.
HERE'S THE SKETCH.

257
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,166
- IT'S A GREAT LIKENESS.

258
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,250
IT'S GOOD, TENCHI.
- YOU THINK SO?

259
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,791
TO BE HONEST, HARUNA,

260
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,708
IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE REALITY SOMEHOW.

261
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,291
- I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

262
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,750
I LIKE THE PORTRAIT
THAT MY TENCHI'S DRAWN OF ME.

263
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,500
- I THINK YOU'RE
JUST BEING KIND.

264
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,125
- I REALLY MEAN IT.

265
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,750
- HARUNA.

266
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,458
- IT'S SO GOOD
BEING CLOSE TO YOU.

267
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,916
- IT FEELS LIKE...
- WHAT, TENCHI?

268
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,500
- LIKE I'M DREAMING.

269
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,958
- DREAMING?

270
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,375
- BEING WITH YOU
THIS WAY,

271
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,458
THE WHOLE THING IS LIKE--

272
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,708
IT'S LIKE A DREAM, HARUNA.

273
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,375
- YOU'RE NOT DREAMING.

274
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,958
- NO.

275
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,250
- YOU'RE NOT DREAMING.

276
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,958
YOU'RE NOT DREAMING,
MY SWEET.

277
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,125
- I'M NOT. 
- ( moans )

278
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,375
YOUR HANDS ARE SO WARM
AND COMFORTING.

279
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,291
- OHH... OH, NO!

280
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,458
- HMM?  OH, GREAT.
 NOW IT'S RAINING.

281
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,291
- Girl: COME ON,
WE'RE GONNA RIDE TOGETHER.

282
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,333
- Boy: I GOT A LOT OF HOMEWORK.

283
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,458
- Girl: IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

284
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,666
COME WITH US.
- Boy: OKAY.

285
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,250
- Girl:
WASN'T THAT CLASS GREAT?

286
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,958
- HUH?

287
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,625
- Girl: SO INSPIRING!

288
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,458
- OH.

289
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,791
- Girl: I'M SO HUNGRY,
I COULDN'T WAIT

290
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,416
FOR CLASS TO BE OVER.
- Boy: ME TOO.

291
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,333
- Girl: COME ON.
- ( laughs )

292
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,333
YEAH, LET'S GO.
COME ON.

293
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,291
- YOU GUYS SHOULD
HAVE BROUGHT AN UMBRELLA.

294
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,500
( laughing )

295
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,541
COME ON, THERE'S ROOM
FOR YOU GUYS, COME HERE.

296
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,000
- LOOK OUT FOR THE PUDDLE.
- ( yelps )

297
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,791
- ( sighs )

298
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,791
- UM, HARUNA.

299
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,541
IT LOOKS LIKE I FOUND
A LITTLE LOST KITTEN.

300
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,250
- ( giggles )

301
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,125
I THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD
ALREADY GONE HOME OR SOMETHING.

302
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,791
- AND YOUR JOB?

303
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,750
- OH, I JUST THOUGHT
I'D TAKE THE AFTERNOON OFF.

304
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,333
- I SEE.
PLAYING HOOKY, ARE WE?

305
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,583
- I BROUGHT THIS.
- NO, THANKS.

306
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,750
I'LL JUST WALK UNDER
YOUR UMBRELLA.

307
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,166
WHAT IS IT?

308
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,375
- ( sighs )
NOTHING.

309
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,041
JUST THINKING HOW
HANDSOME YOU ARE.

310
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:54,375
- OH, NOW YOU'RE TEASING ME.
- ( both laugh )

311
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,833
- ( sighs )

312
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,083
- ( sighs )

313
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,583
( gasps )

314
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,708
WE COULD CHECK
REAL ESTATE OFFICES TODAY.

315
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,958
- ( sighs )
YES, GUESS WE COULD.

316
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,250
- ( slurps )
WHAT?

317
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,083
ARE YOU SAD BECAUSE YOU GOT
A SMALLER PIECE OF BREAD?

318
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,583
- HUH?

319
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:45,833
DID YOU EAT THE REST?!

320
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,791
- ( snickers )

321
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,208
WONDER WHAT THEY'RE
DOING AT HOME?

322
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,291
WHAT DO YOU THINK, AYEKA?
- HUH?

323
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:55,375
- I THINK THE HOUSE
MUST BE QUIET

324
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,333
AND REALLY LONELY
WITHOUT US.

325
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,625
HE'S AROUND HERE.
I KNOW IT.

326
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:03,041
- SASAMI IS AT
THE JURAI ROYAL PALACE.

327
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:06,583
AND KIYONE AND MIHOSHI
ARE AT THE SCIENCE ACADEMY.

328
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:09,416
- AND WE'RE ON THE ROAD,
FOLLOWING THE CLUES,

329
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,166
TRYING TO KEEP
HOPE ALIVE.

330
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,708
TENCHI, YOU BIG FATHEAD!

331
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,166
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?!

332
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,708
- THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW COULD YOU LEAVE

333
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,625
A WONDERFUL
PRINCESS LIKE ME?

334
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,583
I'M HERE
WAITING FOR YOU.

335
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,500
- FORGET ABOUT HER.
JUST COME BACK TO ME.

336
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,583
WE'LL DITCH AYEKA
AND THEN WE CAN PLAY!

337
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:29,666
- WHAT?!

338
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,750
- FACE IT.  I'M THE ONE
HE REALLY LIKES.

339
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,041
YOU'RE JUST IN THE WAY.
- ( growls )

340
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,166
- ( blows raspberry )

341
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,250
- YOU'RE THE REASON
THAT HE LEFT!

342
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,000
- YEAH?!
- ( both growl )

343
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,708
( both sigh )

344
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,041
- OH MY.
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE

345
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,500
SINCE WE'VE FOUGHT
LIKE THIS.

346
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:48,291
- YES, IT HAS.

347
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,458
THANK YOU
FOR TRYING, RYOKO.

348
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,666
- STOP IT.

349
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:59,125
- ( orb beeps )
- ( gasps )

350
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,375
- ( beeping continues )
- ( gasps )

351
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,375
I GOT A READING!

352
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,333
( growls )
- OH!

353
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,833
LORD TENCHI!
- MEET ME DOWN THERE!

354
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,083
TENCHI!

355
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:27,250
TENCHI?

356
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,166
TENCHI...

357
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:44,500
I LOST HIM!
- Ayeka: RYOKO!

358
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,958
( panting )

359
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,625
( gasps )

360
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,583
THAT GIRL WHO WAS WALKING
WITH TENCHI, WHO IS SHE? 

361
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,958
- ( gasps )

362
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,708
HOW THE HELL
WOULD I KNOW?!

363
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,291
I HAVE TO KNOW
WHO SHE IS.

364
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,750
- Boss: RYOKO.

365
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,250
RYOKO!
- ( gasps )

366
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,916
UH, YES?

367
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,125
- THE CUSTOMER AT THE COUNTER
WOULD LIKE SOME COFFEE.

368
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:17,791
- HUH?  OH, YEAH.
- HMPH!

369
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,041
( sighs )
- ( glass shatters )

370
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,291
- HMM?

371
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:35,833
- BROKE A CUP?  WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU GIRLS TODAY?

372
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:38,416
- SORRY, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

373
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,166
I GUESS I'M
A LITTLE TIRED TODAY.

374
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,250
OUCH.

375
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,708
- I'LL CLEAN IT ALL UP.

376
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,708
GET A BANDAGE FOR THAT.

377
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,333
GO ON NOW.
- THANK YOU.

378
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,541
( cries )

379
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,916
- HUH?

380
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,791
AYEKA?

381
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,208
HMM.

382
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,416
- ( sniffling, sobbing )

383
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:13,041
( cries )
TENCHI!

384
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,500
- Mihoshi: KIYONE!  KIYONE!

385
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,500
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?  HUH?

386
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:40,208
- BE QUIET, MIHOSHI.
I REALLY MEAN IT!

387
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:48,125
YES, THE MAIN DATA BANKS
OF THE CENTRAL COMPUTER.

388
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,708
THESE DIMENSION STABILIZERS

389
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:56,041
ARE ABSOLUTELY OFF LIMITS.

390
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,500
IF I GET CAUGHT 
HACKING IN HERE,

391
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,791
I'LL BE BEHIND BARS FOREVER.

392
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:08,625
- ( echoes )
I'M HOME.

393
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,708
- HMM?
( gasps )

394
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,583
- TENCHI, IT'S YOU?!

395
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:17,916
- SORRY I MADE YOU WORRY.
( chuckles )

396
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,250
- OH, LORD TENCHI,
IT'S REALLY YOU.

397
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,250
( gasps )

398
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,958
LORD TENCHI!

399
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:31,583
HUH?

400
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,041
( sighs )

401
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,375
ARE YOU AWAKE?

402
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,333
- NO.

403
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:56,666
- WHO IS THAT
GIRL WE SAW? 

404
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:02,208
SHE LOOKED SO CONTENT,
YOU KNOW?

405
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:05,000
LAUGHING AND SMILING.

406
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:07,458
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
SO RADIANT WITH JOY.

407
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:10,583
- WHO?  THAT GIRL?

408
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,875
- NO, I MEAN LORD TENCHI.

409
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,000
IT SEEMED LIKE HE'D
FORGOTTEN ABOUT US,

410
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,875
LIKE WE DIDN'T EXIST.

411
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:22,250
IS SHE REALLY
THAT PRECIOUS TO HIM, RYOKO?

412
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:26,083
IS HE SO IN LOVE WITH HER THAT
HE CAN'T EVEN SEE US AT ALL?

413
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,291
JUST WHO IS SHE?

414
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,000
HOW DID SHE MEET
LORD TENCHI?

415
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,791
WHY IS HE WITH HER?
- WHO KNOWS.

416
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,125
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE
THAN YOU DO, AYEKA.

417
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,875
- BUT LORD TENCHI AND HER
ARE TOGETHER!

418
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:43,166
( cries )

419
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,625
I'M SORRY I YELLED.

420
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:57,791
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

421
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,875
- YOU WANT TO GO HOME?

422
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,791
- WHAT?
- IF YOU WANT TO GIVE UP,

423
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,041
I WOULDN'T MIND.

424
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,291
I UNDERSTAND
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

425
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:10,333
AND WE BOTH SAW IT
WITH OUR OWN EYES.

426
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:13,083
IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS
SINCE WE WERE WITH HIM.

427
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:16,166
THAT'S A LONG TIME.

428
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,541
MAYBE HE'S GONE
BEYOND OUR REACH.

429
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,333
HE LOOKED OLDER 
AND MORE MATURE.

430
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:24,250
AND HE SEEMED HAPPY.

431
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:27,125
AND THE GIRL,
SHE WAS VERY PRETTY.

432
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:30,458
- BUT, RYOKO...

433
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,833
( cries )

434
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,833
- THINGS CHANGE, AYEKA.

435
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:35,958
HE MAY NOT WANT US
TO FIND HIM.

436
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,708
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?

437
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:41,208
WELL, DON'T TORTURE YOURSELF.

438
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,000
YOU'LL GET ALL WORN OUT.

439
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,041
IT'S BAD
FOR THE COMPLEXION.

440
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:49,166
- RYOKO, YOU'RE SO STRONG.

441
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,875
- GO TO SLEEP.

442
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,791
- ( orb beeps )
- HUH?

443
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:04,416
- ( beeping continues )

444
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,583
- THAT WAY!

445
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,875
- LORD TENCHI!

446
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:14,625
- I'VE GOT HIM NOW.
- ( gasps )

447
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,625
- ( brakes squeal )
- OH, LOOK OUT FOR THAT CAR!

448
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
I LOST HIM AGAIN.

449
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,375
- RYOKO.

450
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,666
- I'M GETTING
TIRED OF TENCHI.

451
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,666
HE'S SUCH A PAIN.

452
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:03,500
- ( sighs )

453
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,166
( sobs angrily )

454
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:57,083
- Tenchi: HARUNA. HARUNA, WHAT
DID YOU DO WITH THAT PORTRAIT?

455
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,791
THE ONE I HAD PINNED UP.

456
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,416
IT'S TORN.

457
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,500
HARUNA, YOU MUST
HAVE DONE IT.

458
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,000
WHY WOULD YOU
WRECK MY PORTRAIT?

459
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,791
HUH?

460
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:09,500
- ( cries )

461
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,583
- HARUNA, I'M SORRY.

462
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,166
I SHOULDN'T HAVE YELLED.

463
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,250
IT WAS JUST A SKETCH.

464
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,208
IT'S NOT REALLY IMPORTANT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

465
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,375
- ( crying )
- LET'S FORGET IT.

466
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,583
COME ON, MAYBE WE CAN
GO OUT AND EAT FOR A CHANGE.

467
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:28,416
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

468
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,250
WE'LL FIND SOME
COZY LITTLE PLACE.

469
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,916
AND WE CAN GO
WINDOW SHOPPING.

470
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:55,500
- I LIKE THE DESIGN
OF THIS ONE.

471
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,291
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

472
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,083
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT EXPENSIVE.

473
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,166
- HMM, WE SHOULD
GIVE IT BACK.

474
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,333
- HMM, NO, DON'T.

475
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,000
I WANT TO
BUY IT FOR YOU.

476
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,333
- YOU DO?! 
OH, TENCHI!

477
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,333
- AND WOULD YOU CARE 
FOR MORE COFFEE, SIR?

478
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,541
- NOPE.
- OKAY, ENJOY YOUR MEAL.

479
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:21,333
- SHE SURE IS
FULL OF ENERGY TODAY.

480
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,375
VERY GOOD.

481
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,500
- Ayeka: WOULD YOU
LIKE MORE COFFEE? 

482
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,000
- Man: YES, PLEASE.
- THIS IS NICE AND FRESH.

483
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,750
- WHAT ARE YOU SO CHEERY ABOUT
ALL OF A SUDDEN, PRINCESS?

484
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,750
- NOTHING, I'M SIMPLY BACK TO
MY NATURALLY OPTIMISTIC SELF.

485
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,583
WHO KNOWS? LORD TENCHI COULD
DROP BY THIS VERY RESTAURANT.

486
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:39,041
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE,
YOU KNOW?

487
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,708
- FINE, ENJOY YOUR WORK,
MISS BRIGHT EYES.

488
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,958
BUT REMEMBER,
YOU'RE STILL AT MINIMUM WAGE.

489
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,750
- MINIMUM WAGE IS BETTER
THAN NO WAGE AT ALL, RYOKO,

490
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,125
IF YOU GET MY MEANING.

491
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,958
NOW YOUR CUSTOMER
IS WAITING FOR YOU.

492
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,458
- I WAS ONLY KIDDING
OF COURSE.

493
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,291
WORK, WORK, WORK.

494
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,708
HERE'S YOUR ORDER, SIR.

495
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:57,375
- HUH?  I DIDN'T ORDER THAT.

496
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:00,333
- OH, REALLY?
YOU SURE?

497
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:02,750
WELL--
THIS IS YOUR ORDER, SIR.

498
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:06,333
WELL, WE'VE GOT IT
ALL STRAIGHT NOW. 

499
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,333
AND HERE'S YOUR BILL--
- ( orb beeping )

500
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,791
( beeping continues )
- HUH?

501
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,291
- HEY.

502
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,791
- HUH?  WHAT--
WHAT'S GOING ON?

503
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,541
- ( gasps )

504
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:28,041
IT'S TENCHI.
- HE'S RIGHT THERE.

505
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:37,416
- HARUNA, I REALLY
 HATE TO SAY THIS,

506
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,333
BUT I THINK
I WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

507
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,291
- HMM?

508
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:42,875
- WE'LL HAVE TO
WATCH OUR EXPENSES

509
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,583
TO MAKE PAYMENTS
ON THESE RINGS. 

510
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,375
- I'M STILL GLAD
WE GOT BOTH OF THEM.

511
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,291
DON'T WORRY ABOUT 
THE MONEY, TENCHI.

512
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,125
- HUH?  BUT YOU DON'T
BRING IN MUCH MONEY

513
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,583
AND I DON'T
HAVE MUCH EITHER.

514
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:54,416
- HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

515
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,916
IT'S FUNNY WHEN THE MACARONI
STICKS TOGETHER LIKE THAT.

516
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,708
- HUH?

517
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,583
( sighs )

518
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,291
- TENCHI!
- LORD TENCHI.

519
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:26,291
- Ryoko: TENCHI?
CAN'T YOU HEAR ME, TENCHI?

520
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,916
- ( Haruna laughs )

521
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,541
- MAYBE THIS
IS A WOMAN THING

522
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,458
BECAUSE I SURE DON'T GET IT.
CLUE ME IN.

523
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,291
IS MACARONI REALLY
THAT ENTERTAINING,

524
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:36,375
OR AM I MISSING SOMETHING?
- NO, I'M SORRY.

525
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,625
- JEEZ.
- IT'S STRANGE.

526
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,375
I DON'T THINK HE CAN
SEE US AT ALL.

527
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,541
- I KNOW, BUT WHY CAN'T HE?

528
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,541
TENCHI.

529
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,458
( gasps )

530
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,708
- HE'S NOT REALLY THERE.
IT'S LIKE HE'S AN APPARITION.

531
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,000
- ( groans lightly )

532
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,625
- LOOK AT ME.

533
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:01,208
I'M RIGHT HERE
IN FRONT OF YOU.

534
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:03,291
JUST LOOK.
( gasps ) 

535
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,458
- MY HEAD HURTS.

536
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,666
- WHAT?  OH, TENCHI.

537
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,250
- ( gasps )
- I'M HERE.

538
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,833
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

539
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,125
- ( groaning )

540
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,458
- AAH!  YOU BITCH!
GIVE ME BACK TENCHI!

541
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:24,416
( grunts )

542
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,208
( groans )
- RYOKO.

543
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:27,750
- I CAN'T REACH THEM.

544
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,083
- WHO ARE YOU?  TELL ME!

545
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:35,416
- LET'S GO HOME, SWEETHEART.

546
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,166
- OKAY.

547
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,625
- ( rumbling )

548
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,166
- ( zapping echoes )

549
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,916
- Both: HUH?

550
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,875
- ( rumbling, whirring )

551
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:54,916
- ( gasps )

552
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,000
- HUH?

553
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:16,875
VANISHED!

554
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,291
- HOW COULD THAT
 HAPPEN, THOUGH?

555
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,500
- Washu: HMM.

556
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:28,583
HARUNA.

557
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,541
WHO IN THE WORLD
IS SHE?

558
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:50,291
- Azaka:
AH, HERE YOU ARE, PRINCESS.

559
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,791
- AZAKA, KAMIDAKE.

560
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,791
- WE HEARD THAT YOU'RE 
RETURNING TO EARTH NOW.

561
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,208
- YES.

562
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,000
- I'M SORRY THAT 
YOU HAD TO TRAVEL

563
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:01,041
ALL THE WAY TO JURAI
ONLY TO LEAVE

564
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,958
WITHOUT FINDING
THE ANSWERS YOU CAME FOR.

565
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:07,458
- PRINCESS SASAMI,
I'M SURE LORD TENCHI

566
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,083
WILL RETURN TO YOU
IN TIME.

567
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:12,125
- HMM.

568
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:14,625
- IT MUST RUN IN THE FAMILY.

569
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,625
LORD YOSHO WAS
EXACTLY THE SAME.

570
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,833
- HUH?

571
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,583
- LONG AGO,
WHEN HE WAS YOUNG,

572
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,791
LORD YOSHO
DISAPPEARED SUDDENLY,

573
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,833
JUST LIKE LORD TENCHI HAS.

574
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:27,833
- CAN YOU TELL ME THAT STORY?
- WHEN HE LEFT THIS PLANET,

575
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:30,000
HE GAVE UP
HIS ROYAL THRONE

576
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,416
AND ALL FOR A LOVE THAT
COULD NOT BE FULFILLED,

577
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,041
FOR THEY COULD NOT MARRY.

578
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,958
THE GIRL WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL.

579
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:38,791
HER NAME WAS CAMELLIA,

580
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:41,166
ALSO KNOWN AS HARUNA.

581
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,541
- HARUNA?

582
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,291
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID
HER NAME WAS?

583
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,833
- THAT'S RIGHT.

584
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:11,458
- YOU REALLY HIT
THE JACKPOT, SASAMI.

585
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:14,291
THAT'S HER!
( cackles )

586
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,291
- HE WAS RIGHT 
IN FRONT OF US.

587
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:28,875
- SO CLOSE.
- AND THEN IT WAS LIKE

588
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:32,166
HE JUST FADED AWAY.
- ( sighs )

589
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,625
- HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

590
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:37,333
IT'S LIKE A NIGHTMARE,
BUT IT'S REAL.

591
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:38,875
- IT'S WORSE
THAN A NIGHTMARE.

592
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,833
AT LEAST WITH A NIGHTMARE,
YOU WAKE UP.

593
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,750
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON WITH ALL THIS?

594
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:46,333
I NEED AN EXPLANATION!

595
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,500
- ( sniffles )

596
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,083
- ( static crackles )

597
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,333
- HI, NICE DAY, ISN'T IT?

598
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:57,083
YOU TWO LOOK
BRIGHT AND CHEERY.  NOT.

599
00:41:57,166 --> 00:42:00,250
INCIDENTALLY, TENCHI DIDN'T
JUST VANISH INTO THIN AIR

600
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,291
RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES
BY ANY CHANCE, DID HE?

601
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:03,125
- ( both gasp )

602
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,666
- WASHU?
- HOW'D YOU KNOW?

603
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,666
WE DIDN'T TELL A SOUL.

604
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,708
A PARALLEL WORLD?

605
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,750
- YOU'RE SAYING THAT
THERE'S A WORLD THAT EXISTS

606
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,500
IN ANOTHER DIMENSION
AND IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO OUR OWN?

607
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:18,291
- YES, IT'S LIKE A MIRROR
OF OUR WORLD.

608
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,208
IN A SENSE, IT'S COUNTLESS
LIGHT-YEARS AWAY

609
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:21,750
AND YET IN A FLASH,

610
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,958
IT CAN BE THE VERY SPOT
WHERE YOU'RE STANDING. 

611
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,458
- WASHU, ARE YOU TELLING US
THAT LORD TENCHI

612
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,958
NO LONGER EXISTS HERE WITH US
IN THE REAL WORLD.

613
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:30,291
- HE POPS IN AND OUT OF IT
LIKE A MIRROR

614
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,750
REFLECTING ANOTHER MIRROR.

615
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:34,291
- BUT A REFLECTION CAN 
GO AWAY FOREVER, WASHU.

616
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:37,750
- TRUE, BUT HE'S NOT STABILIZED
IN THIS MIRROR WORLD YET.

617
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,708
HIS THOUGHTS KEEP
BRINGING HIM BACK HERE.

618
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,500
THAT MEANS WE HAVE A CHANCE
OF REACHING HIM,

619
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:44,500
BUT IT WON'T LAST LONG.
OF COURSE YOU KNOW

620
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,833
THE ONE WHO PULLED HIM INTO
THIS MIRROR WORLD WAS HARUNA.

621
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:48,583
AND SHE'LL TRY TO
KEEP HIM THERE TOO.

622
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,708
- THAT GIRL HE WAS WITH!
- MM-HMM.

623
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,333
- HOW CAN WE
GET TO HIM, WASHU?!

624
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:00,375
WE'VE GOT TO REACH HIM.

625
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:01,916
- FIRST, I'LL CALIBRATE

626
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,083
THE INTERSECT PROBABILITIES
OF THE TWO WORLDS,

627
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,791
OURS AND THE PARALLEL DIMENSION
WHERE TENCHI IS.

628
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,333
- Ryoko: YOU CAN DO THAT?

629
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:09,750
- OH, SURE I CAN,

630
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:11,083
BUT ONLY WITH
THE SCIENCE ACADEMY'S

631
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,875
DIMENSION STABILIZING SYSTEM.

632
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:16,125
WITH THAT, I CAN EVEN CHANGE
THE ORBIT OF A PLANET IF I WANT.

633
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:18,291
I'VE ALREADY SENT 
KIYONE AND MIHOSHI

634
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:19,833
TO BREAK INTO
THE SCIENCE ACADEMY.

635
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:21,208
ALTHOUGH, IT IS
A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS.

636
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:31,041
- Ryoko: HOW MUCH TIME
DO WE HAVE TO DO ALL THIS?

637
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:33,125
- WELL, EVEN NOW, 
TENCHI IS BECOMING

638
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,208
MORE AND MORE A PART
OF THIS PARALLEL WORLD.

639
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:37,833
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO WORK
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

640
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,916
AS SOON AS MIHOSHI AND KIYONE
COMPLETE THEIR MISSION,

641
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,291
I'LL SEND YOU TWO INTO ACTION,
SO BE READY.

642
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:02,250
- ( lightly moan )

643
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,208
( groans )

644
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,458
HMM.  AH.

645
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,833
- ( gasps )

646
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,500
( gasps )

647
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:51,750
( pants, gasps )

648
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:54,208
( panting )

649
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:01,833
- HARUNA, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

650
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:05,166
- NOTHING, BUT DON'T YOU WANT
ME TO POSE FOR YOU NOW?

651
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,291
YOU NEVER ASK ME
ANYMORE, TENCHI.

652
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:10,208
- NO, I THINK
I'LL CALL IT A DAY.

653
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,458
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I'VE BEEN
HAVING TERRIBLE HEADACHES.

654
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:16,916
- YES, YOU DO LOOK
A LITTLE BIT PALE.

655
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,583
MAYBE YOU BETTER NOT
PAINT FOR A WHILE.

656
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:21,208
- HM-HMM.

657
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,291
HARUNA.

658
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,541
- OH, I DIDN'T
HEAR YOU COMING.

659
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:39,333
- MM-HMM.

660
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:41,750
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS ROOM

661
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,375
AND, WELL, CAN 
YOU DO ANYTHING

662
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:45,291
ABOUT THE COLOR
OF THESE CURTAINS?

663
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,083
- WHAT?

664
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,166
- WELL, ANY COLOR, BUT
PINK, YOU KNOW.

665
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,333
HOW ABOUT BEIGE
OR LIGHT BLUE? 

666
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,125
- OH, I'M SORRY.

667
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,916
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
DIDN'T LIKE THEM.

668
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,833
I'LL CHANGE THEM TOMORROW.

669
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:58,791
- THANKS.

670
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,833
- ( exhales, moans )

671
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,333
- WHAT IS IT?

672
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:06,166
- I'M AFRAID.

673
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,791
AFRAID YOU MIGHT
GO FAR AWAY FROM ME.

674
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:10,416
- OH, DON'T BE SILLY.

675
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,250
I'M JUST NOT
FEELING TOO WELL.

676
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,583
WE'LL GO TO BED
EARLY TONIGHT. 

677
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:16,416
- MM-HMM.

678
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,000
- I'LL BE FINE
AFTER I GET SOME REST.

679
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:32,250
- HARUNA.

680
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,708
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
SO LONELY.

681
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:41,375
- LORD KATSUHITO.

682
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:44,000
- OH, WASHU, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

683
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:46,833
- SASAMI FOUND OUT
ABOUT HARUNA.

684
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:48,333
AND SHE TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

685
00:46:48,416 --> 00:46:50,375
- AH, I SEE.

686
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:53,125
- LORD KATSUHITO,
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

687
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,041
TENCHI'S BEING DRAWN
MORE AND MORE

688
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,791
INTO THIS OTHER WORLD,
FARTHER AWAY FROM US. 

689
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,333
NOW I NEED SOME ANSWERS.

690
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,291
- HE'S IN DANGER?

691
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,041
YES, I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT, WASHU.

692
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,791
I'LL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED

693
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,833
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LORD
ON JURAI.

694
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,000
HARUNA HAD THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL EYES I HAD EVER SEEN.

695
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:17,083
I LOVED HER VERY MUCH,
BUT THAT WAS LONG AGO.

696
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,875
HARUNA AND I
LEFT JURAI TOGETHER.

697
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:22,708
WE JOURNEYED
TO A DISTANT PLANET, EARTH.

698
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:24,708
BUT THE LONG JOURNEY
THROUGH SPACE

699
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:25,958
WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER.

700
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,625
SHE FELL ILL,

701
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:29,416
GRAVELY ILL.

702
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:34,333
- THANK YOU, DEAR.

703
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:37,875
- FOR THE FLOWERS
YOU MEAN?

704
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,750
- NOT THAT.

705
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:42,208
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

706
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:43,958
( sniffs )

707
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:48,416
THANK YOU.

708
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,916
- DON'T TALK ABOUT
THE PAST, HARUNA. 

709
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,291
THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE,

710
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,833
EVERYTHING
WE'LL SHARE TOGETHER.

711
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,833
HARUNA?

712
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:11,333
HARUNA!

713
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:17,791
( whispers )
HARUNA.

714
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:21,458
HARUNA!  HARUNA!  HARUNA!

715
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:24,125
HARUNA!

716
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:27,875
- Present-day Katsuhito:
I LANDED ON EARTH.

717
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:29,833
AND BURIED HER 
IN THIS GROUND.

718
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:32,291
AND BESIDE HER,
I PLANTED THE TREE

719
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,083
THAT HAD LOST ITS MASTER.

720
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,833
- YOU MEAN YOU BROUGHT
THAT TREE FROM JURAI? 

721
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:38,708
- YES, YOU SEE, EACH JURAIAN
HAS A SPECIAL TREE

722
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,458
THAT IS THEIRS ONLY.

723
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:43,208
THIS WAS HERS--
THIS BEAUTIFUL CAMELLIA.

724
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:47,291
AFTERWARD, WHEN I SAW
THE TREE TAKE ROOT

725
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:48,833
AND SPRING BACK TO LIFE,

726
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:51,458
BEARING FLOWERS AS BEAUTIFUL
AS HARUNA HERSELF,

727
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:54,833
THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED
TO LIVE IN THIS LAND AS WELL.

728
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:57,625
I WANTED HARUNA'S SPIRIT

729
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,333
TO KNOW THE MAJESTY
OF THIS PLANET

730
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,083
AND TO GRACE IT
WITH HER OWN BEAUTY.

731
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:03,625
SO AS I GREW OLDER,

732
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,041
WHEREVER I WENT, I PLANTED
THE BRANCHES FROM THAT TREE.

733
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:08,208
SO SHE WAS ALWAYS WITH ME.

734
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:12,166
- THEN THE TREE BEHIND THE
MASAKI SHRINE IS ONE OF THEM?

735
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,708
- YES, IT'S FROM THIS TREE.

736
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:16,833
IT WAS WHEN
I PLANTED THAT BRANCH,

737
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,375
THAT I MET MY WIFE ITSUKI.

738
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:20,833
SHE WAS DIFFERENT
FROM HARUNA.

739
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,125
SHE SPARKLED WITH
ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT.

740
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:26,083
SOON OUR DAUGHTER
ACHIKA WAS BORN. 

741
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:29,166
- AND SO ACHIKA GREW UP
AND MARRIED NOBOYUKI.

742
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,333
AND THEN, IN TIME,
SHE GAVE BIRTH TO TENCHI.

743
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:33,791
- YES.
WHEN I MARRIED AGAIN,

744
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:36,041
I BELIEVE THAT IT DISTURBED
HARUNA'S SPIRIT.

745
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,875
SHE MUST HAVE FELT BETRAYED
WHEN I FOUND SO MUCH JOY,

746
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:41,625
JOY THAT SHE AND I
NEVER EXPERIENCED TOGETHER.

747
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:44,375
- SO THAT'S IT.
SHE MUST HAVE TAKEN TENCHI

748
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:46,291
TO EXPERIENCE
THE LIFE SHE NEVER HAD.

749
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:49,291
- SHE WAS SO KIND AND GENTLE.

750
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:50,875
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO BELIEVE IT.

751
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:54,625
I THOUGHT OF CUTTING DOWN
THIS TREE TO FIND OUT.

752
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:56,500
LOOK AT IT, WASHU.

753
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:58,875
CAN YOU SEE
THAT IT'S DYING?

754
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,916
IT MUSTERED
ALL ITS ENERGY

755
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,833
TRYING TO BLOOM
ONE LAST TIME.

756
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:05,875
THAT'S WHEN HARUNA'S SOUL
WAS AWAKENED

757
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:07,208
FROM ITS DEEP SLEEP.

758
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:09,166
AND SHE REMEMBERED
ALL SHE HAD LOST. 

759
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,208
HARUNA MUST HAVE
WANTED DESPERATELY

760
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:14,166
TO FEEL THE LOVE THAT HAD BEEN
TAKEN AWAY FROM HER SO LONG AGO.

761
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,916
- BUT WHY DID SHE TAKE TENCHI
INSTEAD OF YOU?

762
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,333
THAT'S WHAT I DON'T GET.

763
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:21,541
- TENCHI HAS A TENDER HEART.

764
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:23,583
I'M OLD AND WEATHERED NOW,

765
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:26,500
BUT HE IS LIKE THE YOUNG MAN
SHE USED TO KNOW

766
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:28,625
AND LOVE.

767
00:50:58,375 --> 00:50:59,541
- ( gasps )

768
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,708
- I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS GIRL.
SHE'S NOT REAL.

769
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:22,250
SHE'S JUST AN IMAGE
THAT I'M PAINTING. 

770
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:23,500
AN IDEA.

771
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,500
OH, HOW CAN
I EXPLAIN THIS?

772
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:30,500
I FEEL THIS PRESENCE
AND I HAVE TO PUT IT ON CANVAS.

773
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:34,750
WHY WOULD THAT UPSET YOU
WHEN IT'S ALL IMAGINARY?

774
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:37,041
I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

775
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:39,375
- I DON'T LIKE HER.

776
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,291
THAT'S ALL.

777
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:44,250
- YOU DON'T LIKE HER?

778
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,791
WHY IS THAT?
EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

779
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,708
I HAVE TO PAINT WHAT'S IN
MY HEART AND IN MY HEAD.

780
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:51,791
YOU KNOW THAT.
HOW CAN YOU HATE A SKETCH,

781
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:52,875
A PIECE OF ART?

782
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:57,791
( groans )

783
00:51:57,875 --> 00:51:59,708
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

784
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:10,250
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? 
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

785
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,708
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO I AM ANYMORE.

786
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:14,750
I FEEL LIKE
I LOST MYSELF SOMEWHERE

787
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:15,791
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE.

788
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:20,333
UH!

789
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,750
- TENCHI...

790
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,875
- ( moans, exhales )

791
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:31,083
- DO YOU--
DO YOU LOVE ME?

792
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:34,333
- ( breathily )
HA-- HARUNA.

793
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:40,875
- DO YOU LOVE ME?  HUH?

794
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:44,500
- ( moans )
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.

795
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,791
- I NEED TO
HEAR YOU SAY IT.

796
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,041
TENCHI, DO YOU LOVE ME?

797
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:08,708
DO YOU?

798
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:10,875
- I LOVE YOU.

799
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:13,125
- WILL YOU LOVE ME
FOREVER AND EVER? 

800
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:15,375
- YEAH.

801
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,333
- WILL YOU STAY WITH ME
FOREVER AND EVER?

802
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,916
- UH-HUH.

803
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,833
- LOOK AT ME.
KEEP YOUR EYES ON ME

804
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:26,541
AND NEVER LEAVE MY SIDE.

805
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:32,375
PROMISE ME.

806
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,958
- WITH THE DIMENSION
STABILIZING SYSTEM, 

807
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,333
I CAN CREATE
AN INTERSECT BETWEEN

808
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:47,041
OUR WORLD AND
THE PARALLEL WORLD.

809
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:48,500
THE PROBLEM IS POWERING
THE FIELD JUMP

810
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:50,291
AND FOCUSING THAT
ENERGY ON TENCHI.

811
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:52,291
I'LL NEED SEVERAL
RELAY POINTS.

812
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:53,625
NOW WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND

813
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:55,583
A JURAI ENERGY SOURCE
HERE ON EARTH?

814
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:58,500
ENERGY IN A FIXED FORM
THAT I CAN PINPOINT AND HARNESS.

815
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:00,666
WELL, AN ORGANIC LIFE FORM

816
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,708
WOULD SURE DO THE TRICK
IF I COULD FIND ONE.

817
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:05,583
THAT'S IT.

818
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:07,791
THE CAMELLIA TREES THAT
LORD KATSUHITO PLANTED,

819
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,041
THEY'D BE PERFECT.

820
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,375
- Mihoshi: WE'RE HERE!
- HMM?

821
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:16,291
- HI.
- WE DID IT!

822
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:18,458
- WE GOT THE DATA FROM 
THE DIMENSIONAL SYSTEM.

823
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:21,000
- ALL RIGHT.
WHEN IT COMES TO COVERT OPS,

824
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,833
YOU TWO ARE THE TOP.

825
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,250
HEY, I RHYMED.

826
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,708
OH, BY THE WAY, I HAVE
ANOTHER MISSION FOR YOU.

827
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:30,666
- ( gulps )
ANOTHER ONE?

828
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,708
- WHEN WOULD WE GO?

829
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:35,125
- ( snickers ) 
NOW, OF COURSE.

830
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,458
- ( groans )

831
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:17,250
- THAT'S IT.

832
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:19,041
I'M POWERED UP AND
LOCKED ONTO THE SPOT

833
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,291
WHERE TENCHI
FIRST CROSSED OVER

834
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:21,916
INTO THE OTHER WORLD.

835
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,500
IF MIHOSHI AND KIYONE
CAN SET UP THE RELAY SPOTS,

836
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:26,500
WE'LL BE READY TO DO
A FIELD TRANSFER.

837
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:28,458
- ( pants ) WASHU, 
CERTAINLY KNOWS HOW

838
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:30,750
TO MAKE THE BEST USE
OF HUMAN RESOURCES. 

839
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:39,750
HERE IT IS.

840
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:51,625
OF COURSE SHE HAD
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HER.

841
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:54,541
- IS IT MY FAULT
I GET LOST?

842
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,625
THEY ALWAYS MAKE
THE DIRECTIONS SO COMPLICATED:

843
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:59,291
LEFT, RIGHT, AND ALL THAT.

844
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:00,875
HEY, THAT'S IT.

845
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:11,958
- ( buzzing )

846
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:17,333
- THIS AND THIS AND THIS!

847
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,750
PHEW.

848
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,291
- ( phone rings )
- ( giggles )

849
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,750
KIYONE, IT'S ME.
I'M ALL DONE.

850
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:26,500
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M PROUD OF YOU, MIHOSHI.

851
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,291
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

852
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:31,041
TENCHI, WE'RE
GONNA FIND YOU!

853
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,916
- TENCHI,
YOUR DINNER IS READY.

854
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:47,375
- ( groans )

855
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:49,041
I DON'T REALLY
FEEL LIKE EATING.

856
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,583
( groans )

857
00:56:57,583 --> 00:56:59,791
- I MADE A NICE SALAD
 WITH LOTS OF GREENS.

858
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,666
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
GIVE YOU SOME ENERGY.

859
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,083
HERE, TRY IT.

860
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:22,666
- ( static )

861
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,416
- ( pounding on TV )

862
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,625
- ( Tenchi groans )

863
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,791
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS THING?

864
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,916
THE ANTENNA'S CONNECTED,
BUT I CAN NEVER GET ANYTHING

865
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,708
ON THIS SCREEN!  UGH!

866
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:36,583
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THIS WORLD? 

867
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:39,583
I KNOW-- THE MONEY WE SAVED
FOR THE RING,

868
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,666
I'LL USE IT TO FIX THE TV.

869
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:52,583
WHAT'S THIS?

870
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:55,041
WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR ACCOUNT?
THIS IS JUST CRAZY.

871
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:57,916
- DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, TENCHI!
JUST PUT IT AWAY!

872
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,541
- DON'T THINK ABOUT IT?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?!

873
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:02,208
SOMETHING IS WRONG HERE

874
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:04,291
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
HARUNA! WHAT IS IT?!

875
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:05,625
I'M TIRED OF BEING
KEPT IN THE DARK. 

876
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:06,833
YOU'RE HIDING
SOMETHING FROM ME

877
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,541
AND I CAN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE!

878
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:10,708
UGH!  UGH.

879
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:13,375
IF YOU WON'T TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON,

880
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:16,083
I CAN'T...

881
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:18,416
- OH, TENCHI.

882
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:23,000
- ( groans )

883
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:32,666
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

884
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,666
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYMORE.

885
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,916
- I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.

886
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,875
I'M SO VERY SORRY.

887
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:43,791
I JUST WANTED TO HAVE 
A HAPPY LIFE WITH YOU.

888
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:46,416
THAT'S ALL I EVER WANTED.

889
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,166
- HUH?

890
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,375
- OH.

891
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:57,458
MMM.
( kisses )

892
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:59,875
OH.

893
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:02,750
( whimpers )

894
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:10,125
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT
I'VE MADE YOU MY WHOLE WORLD,

895
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,291
BUT NOW...

896
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:17,583
I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP
LOVING YOU LIKE THIS, HARUNA.

897
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:20,416
IT HURTS TOO MUCH.
- NO, PLEASE.

898
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:26,666
- ( groans )

899
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,208
- ( sniffles )

900
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:41,083
- ( electricity crackling )

901
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:42,500
( static )

902
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,583
( crackling continues )

903
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:55,875
- HARUNA.

904
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,500
- DIMENSION STABILIZING
SYSTEM IS ON.

905
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,583
- YOU READY, AYEKA?
- VERY READY.

906
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:12,375
- WE'VE BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME.

907
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,625
- I PRAY WE FIND HIM.

908
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:15,583
- ( beeping )

909
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,458
- GOOD MORNING, LADIES,

910
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:22,166
FEEL LIKE A LITTLE
DIMENSION JUMP?

911
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,708
- OH, YES.
- JUST SAY THE WORD, WASHU.

912
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,708
- HMM.

913
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:29,166
- IS SOMETHING WRONG,
WASHU?

914
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,208
- I WAS JUST THINKING.

915
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:33,916
WOMEN ARE SO STRONG
AND DARING WHEN THEY'RE IN LOVE.

916
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,791
SO GOOD LUCK.

917
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:39,791
- Ryoko: WOMEN ARE
STRONG AND DARING 

918
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:41,541
WHEN THEY'RE IN LOVE.

919
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:43,375
HMM.

920
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,291
- I'M HERE, TENCHI.

921
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,041
- ACTIVATE
JURAI POWER SOURCE.

922
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:14,250
- ( beeping )

923
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:16,833
- ( beeping )

924
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:19,750
- ( beeping )

925
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:22,333
- ( beeping )

926
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,291
- ( beeping )

927
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:30,125
- ( static )

928
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,875
- ( wind rushes )
- ( thunder rumbles )

929
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,166
- READY, RYOKO?
- MM-HMM.

930
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,083
- ( wind rushing )

931
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:14,041
- INTERSECT LOCKED.

932
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:16,166
OUR TWO WORLDS
ARE IN LINE.

933
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,833
- ( zapping )
- HUH?

934
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:32,583
( groans )

935
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,541
- ( groaning )

936
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:37,916
- WE'RE COMING
TO SAVE YOU, TENCHI!

937
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:51,250
- ( screams )

938
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:52,375
- RYOKO, I--

939
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,791
- TENCHI, YEAH!

940
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,250
- UH!
- ( yelps )

941
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:01,958
- ( growls )

942
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:03,416
- I KNOW HER.
SHE'S REAL.

943
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,750
- OH, YEAH, WAIT TILL
YOU SEE HOW REAL.

944
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,958
NOW-- WHAT?
- Ayeka: RYOKO!

945
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,416
OUCH.

946
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,833
I DIDN'T QUITE GET
THE LANDING RIGHT.

947
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:12,458
- HEY, TO THE FRONT,
AYEKA, GO!

948
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:15,541
- EVERYTHING HURTS,
BUT I'LL DO IT FOR TENCHI.

949
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,458
OH.  HUH?

950
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:21,416
- HERE, TAKE SOME PERSIMMONS.
I JUST PICKED THEM, HARUNA.

951
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,208
- UH, NO, THANKS.
THAT'S OKAY.

952
01:03:23,291 --> 01:03:24,458
( giggles )

953
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:29,041
- YOU!  HOW DID
YOU GET HERE?

954
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:31,583
- LET'S GO, COME ON
WITH US, TENCHI, HURRY!

955
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:34,000
- NO!
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

956
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:35,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

957
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:37,458
- TENCHI, IT'S RYOKO.

958
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:38,541
I CAME HERE FOR YOU.

959
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:40,791
- RYOKO...

960
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:43,250
DO YOU MEAN-- HAVE YOU
COME OUT OF MY DRAWING?

961
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:45,041
- SHE'S JUST AN ILLUSION.

962
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:47,541
- GET OUT OF MY WAY.
LET HIM GO.

963
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:49,166
- NO, HELP ME, TENCHI.

964
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:51,583
TELL HER TO GO BACK TO WHERE
SHE CAME FROM RIGHT NOW.

965
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:53,916
- ( growls )
YOU WITCH, YOU'LL PAY!

966
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,916
- ( static )
- HUH?

967
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,500
- ONE, TWO, YEAH!

968
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,250
COME ON, STRETCH, LADIES.

969
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:01,916
UP, DOWN.
UP, DOWN.

970
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,833
- OH, WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO DO THAT

971
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:05,000
WHEN IT WAS FINALLY WORKING?

972
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:06,541
WHY?
- FORGET THE TV.

973
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:08,750
PLEASE.
- YOU CAN'T GET AWAY.

974
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:12,041
- LORD TENCHI.
- WHO ARE YOU?

975
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,041
- IT'S ME, AYEKA.

976
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:15,458
- SEE?
THERE'S NO WAY OUT.

977
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:17,083
SO HAND TENCHI OVER NOW.

978
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:19,416
- WE WON'T HURT YOU.
JUST GIVE TENCHI BACK.

979
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,833
- ( gasps )

980
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:25,250
( sighs )

981
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:28,541
I WON'T.

982
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:29,541
- HUH?

983
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:32,541
- YOU BARGE INTO MY HOME

984
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,125
AND YOU MAKE THESE DEMANDS.

985
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,208
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'VE GONE THROUGH. 

986
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:38,416
I'LL NEVER LET TENCHI GO.

987
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,708
TENCHI BELONGS HERE.

988
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:42,125
NOW GO BACK
TO YOUR OWN WORLD.

989
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,333
- ( gasps )

990
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:45,083
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

991
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:47,083
- ( screams )

992
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,875
- HARUNA, WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO THEM?

993
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:53,083
- I SAID GO BACK
TO YOUR WORLD!

994
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:55,291
- ( both screaming )

995
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:03,458
- HMM?  WHAT--
 WHAT IN THE--

996
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:04,791
- ( thunder crashes )
- WHAT IS IT?

997
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,625
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

998
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:13,500
- ( thunder crashes )
- ( screams )

999
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:16,125
- IMPOSSIBLE.  SHE'S SENDING
OUR ENERGY PULSE BACK HERE

1000
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:17,625
FROM THE PARALLEL WORLD.

1001
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:29,041
- ( tree rumbles, cracking )

1002
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,833
- HARUNA.

1003
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:38,041
- Ayeka: RYOKO.
- HMM, HUH?

1004
01:05:40,625 --> 01:05:42,833
HUH?!
- I'M GLAD YOU WOKE UP.

1005
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:44,541
- AYEKA.

1006
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:53,375
- DID YOU THINK I HAD
NO POWER TO DEAL WITH YOU

1007
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:55,791
TRESPASSING INTO MY WORLD?

1008
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,208
- GIVE TENCHI BACK!

1009
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:58,875
- HE'S MY MAN.

1010
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:01,291
I'M HIS WOMAN. 
THAT'S REALITY.

1011
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,166
AND, BY THE WAY,
HE LOVES ME,

1012
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,541
IN CASE
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE.

1013
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:06,875
- OH, PLEASE.
IT'S JUST A TRICK.

1014
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:08,916
- YOU MADE HIM FORGET.
HOW COULD HE LOVE YOU 

1015
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,166
IF HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE IS?
- HE KNOWS ENOUGH.

1016
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:13,083
HE KNOWS HOW HE FEELS
IN HIS HEART.

1017
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:14,708
IT'S VERY SIMPLE, REALLY.

1018
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:17,208
I WANTED HIM, SO I DREW
HIM INTO THIS WORLD

1019
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:18,791
AND GAVE HIM
WHAT HE WANTED.

1020
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,750
- Ryoko: THEN WHY
IS HE SO UNHAPPY?

1021
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:22,791
- WAS HE HAPPY WITH YOU
FIGHTING OVER HIM,

1022
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,666
DRIVING HIM AWAY
INTO THE FOREST?

1023
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,583
- YOU LISTEN!

1024
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:28,208
I'M NOT LEAVING HIM
WITH A WITCH

1025
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:30,666
WHO KEEPS HIM IN SOME 
MADE-UP FANTASY WORLD.

1026
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,625
- ( giggles )

1027
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:35,125
YOU'RE SO BRAZEN.
HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT.

1028
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,791
- HARUNA, THIS IS WRONG.

1029
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:38,125
IT'S NOT FAIR TO TENCHI.

1030
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:39,875
- REALLY?  AND ARE YOU
FAIR TO HIM

1031
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:41,208
OR DO YOU JUST WANT HIM?

1032
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:42,708
I THINK WE'RE ALL
JUST THE SAME.

1033
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,625
WE ALL WANT TENCHI,
AND WHOEVER WANTS

1034
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:46,166
HIM THE MOST
WILL HAVE HIM.

1035
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,666
AFTER HALF A CENTURY
OF WAITING,

1036
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,750
MY DESIRE IS STRONG.

1037
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:55,000
I'M LETTING YOU GO, 
BUT DON'T COME BACK.

1038
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,250
- TENCHI!

1039
01:06:57,333 --> 01:07:00,500
- ( wind rushes )

1040
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:05,291
- EXTRAORDINARY.

1041
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:07,750
THIS PARALLEL WORLD
HAS A SHORTER AXIS.

1042
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:10,666
THAT'S WHY TIME
MOVES FASTER THERE.

1043
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,041
- ( both grunt )

1044
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:20,000
( groaning )

1045
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,333
- WHERE ARE WE?
- AAH.

1046
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:26,125
SHE TRANSPORTED US BACK.

1047
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,666
- ( beeping )

1048
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:30,958
- OH.

1049
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,291
- OH, WASHU, PLEASE.

1050
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:36,166
TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

1051
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,500
- WELL, I SUSPECTED
THERE WAS A FLAW

1052
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:40,500
IN THE FIELD INTERSECT.

1053
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:42,208
YOU SEE, TIME MOVES FASTER
IN THAT WORLD.

1054
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,625
YOU SAW HOW TENCHI LOOKED,

1055
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:45,208
DIDN'T YOU?
HE'S OLDER THERE.

1056
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:47,875
HARUNA SHORTENED
THE TIME AXIS ON PURPOSE.

1057
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:51,041
SO SHE COULD HAVE TENCHI
EXACTLY THE WAY SHE WANTED HIM.

1058
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:54,083
THAT WORLD IS MADE
ENTIRELY OF HER DESIRES.

1059
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:56,125
- BUT WHY WOULD
SHE DO SUCH A THING?

1060
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:58,208
- BECAUSE SHE'S ACTING OUT
HER EMOTIONS.

1061
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:00,458
SHE'S CREATED THAT WORLD
OUT OF HER FEELINGS.

1062
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:02,666
I'M AFRAID ANY FURTHER 
SCIENTIFIC INTERFERENCE

1063
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,541
IS IMPOSSIBLE.
- UGH!

1064
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:06,750
- BUT, WASHU,
IF WE DON'T GO BACK THERE,

1065
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,125
WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO TENCHI?

1066
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,083
- UNLESS SOME INCIDENT
JARS HIS MEMORY,

1067
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:12,458
HE'LL JUST REMAIN THERE.
AND IT GETS WORSE.

1068
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:15,541
TENCHI'S JURAI ENERGY IS KEEPING
THAT WORLD STABILIZED.

1069
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:19,333
WHEN HE GETS TOO EXHAUSTED,
THE WHOLE WORLD WILL FALL APART.

1070
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:21,541
- IT CAN'T BE.
- UGH!

1071
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:23,875
WASHU, THERE MUST BE A WAY
TO GET BACK THERE.

1072
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:34,375
- HARUNA, WHERE ARE YOU?
- Ryoko: TENCHI!

1073
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:41,500
- Ayeka: LORD TENCHI!

1074
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:45,375
- I HEAR VOICES 
CALLING MY NAME,

1075
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:49,208
BUT WHO ARE THEY?
- Ryoko: TENCHI, YOU DAMN FOOL!

1076
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,125
- ( clock ticking )
- ( groans )

1077
01:08:57,875 --> 01:08:59,041
( sighs )

1078
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,458
- ( water running )

1079
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:22,125
- ( chopping )

1080
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,666
- WAKE UP, TENCHI.
YOU'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

1081
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:53,666
- ( groans )
- ( window opens )

1082
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,875
- IT'S A LOVELY DAY.

1083
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:11,416
- ( rumbling, crashes )
- OH!

1084
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,291
- HELLO, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

1085
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:16,916
- I NAILED THE LANDING THIS
TIME. PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

1086
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,250
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN
TO GIVE UP, DO YOU?

1087
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:22,750
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS GONNA SAY TO YOU.

1088
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:24,375
THIS WHOLE WORLD'S
A DEATH TRAP.

1089
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:25,750
NOW LET HIM GO!

1090
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:27,750
- NO, I'LL NEVER LEAVE HIM.

1091
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,541
- HARUNA, YOU SAID 
WE'RE ALL THE SAME,

1092
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,166
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US.

1093
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,250
WE DON'T LIE TO TENCHI
OR KEEP HIM TRAPPED

1094
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,541
IN AN IMAGINARY WORLD
OF MAKE-BELIEVE.

1095
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:38,375
- IT MAY BE MAKE-BELIEVE TO YOU,
BUT IT'S REAL TO ME.

1096
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:40,375
AND NOW IT'S REAL 
TO TENCHI AS WELL.

1097
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:43,166
HE DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHO YOU ARE, EITHER ONE OF YOU.

1098
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,958
- LOOK AT US.
THINK HARD.

1099
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:47,375
I KNOW THAT YOU REMEMBER
WHO WE ARE, DON'T YOU?

1100
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:50,333
- LEAVE HIM ALONE!
- I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU!

1101
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:51,791
- I'M TELLING YOU
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER

1102
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:53,958
ANYTHING BUT THIS WORLD.

1103
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,750
- Ayeka: YOU DO REMEMBER,
LORD TENCHI, DON'T YOU?

1104
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:59,291
- LET TENCHI ANSWER, HARUNA.

1105
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:01,833
- WE'RE FROM YOUR WORLD,
TENCHI, THE REAL WORLD.

1106
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:06,250
- Haruna: HOW DO YOU
KNOW WHAT IS REAL?

1107
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:07,875
I HOLD HIM IN MY ARMS
AND FEEL HIS WARMTH

1108
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,250
AND HE FEELS MINE.

1109
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,208
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE REAL THAN THAT.

1110
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:13,208
WHAT DO YOU THINK
CREATED THIS WORLD?

1111
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:15,208
NOT SCIENCE, NOT MAGIC.

1112
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:17,125
IT'S THE POWER OF MY HEART.

1113
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:21,583
- VERY WELL THEN.

1114
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:23,166
I'LL REACH OUT TO TENCHI
WITH MY HEART.

1115
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,416
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH FEELINGS, HARUNA.

1116
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,041
LET'S SEE WHOSE HEART
IS STRONGER.

1117
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,791
- YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
YOU CAN GET PAST ME

1118
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:34,958
HERE IN MY OWN WORLD,
DO YOU?

1119
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,750
- AND YOU DON'T THINK WE'LL
LEAVE WITHOUT A FIGHT, DO YOU?

1120
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:41,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WE DON'T NEED WEAPONS.

1121
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:43,458
GET UP.  I'LL SHOW YOU
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS

1122
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:46,166
WHEN YOU FIGHT A SPACE PIRATE.
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

1123
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:49,625
- ( gasps )
- ( gasps )

1124
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:52,708
- RYOKO, AYEKA, STAY BACK
AND LEAVE HER ALONE.

1125
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:54,791
- WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING HER,
LORD TENCHI?

1126
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:57,458
- WE CAME HERE FOR YOU, TENCHI.

1127
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:59,833
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW SHE FEELS RIGHT NOW,

1128
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,375
BUT I DO.
- TENCHI.

1129
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:04,208
- YOU MEAN THAT YOU--

1130
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,541
YOU WANT TO
STAY HERE WITH HER?

1131
01:12:06,625 --> 01:12:08,625
- ( gasps )
IT'S VANISHING AGAIN.

1132
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:10,291
- NO, WE DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO, PLEASE!

1133
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,208
- DON'T LET US GO!

1134
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:16,708
TENCHI!
- LORD TENCHI!

1135
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:34,458
- ( orb beeps )

1136
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,333
- WELL, I WARNED YOU 
NOT TO GO BACK THERE,

1137
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:39,541
NOW, DIDN'T I?

1138
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:41,375
- ( whimpers )

1139
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:45,041
- NO MORE.

1140
01:12:45,125 --> 01:12:47,083
HE'LL NEVER COME
BACK TO US NOW. 

1141
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:49,500
AND THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

1142
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:59,166
HE CHOSE HER.

1143
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,875
I COULDN'T REACH HIM
WITH MY HEART.

1144
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:05,791
- ( clock ticking )
- ( groans )

1145
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:08,833
( sighs )

1146
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:30,125
- ( chopping )

1147
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:33,541
- HUH?

1148
01:13:56,916 --> 01:14:00,125
- HMM?

1149
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:02,791
WAKE UP, TENCHI.
YOU'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

1150
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:09,375
- ( groans )
- ( window opens )

1151
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:21,000
- IT'S A LOVELY DAY.

1152
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:27,541
- HARUNA, WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

1153
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:34,083
WE CAN'T IGNORE IT.

1154
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:36,500
YOU KNOW WE NEED TO FACE
THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS WORLD.

1155
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:40,791
- SO YOU REMEMBER.
EVERYTHING IS CLEAR NOW?

1156
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:43,333
- HMM.

1157
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,375
- LOOK OUTSIDE.

1158
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:48,333
CLEAR SKIES, SUNSHINE.

1159
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:50,291
EVERYTHING IS CALM
AND PEACEFUL HERE.

1160
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,000
ISN'T THAT
THE WAY IT SHOULD BE?

1161
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,875
WE CAN LIVE
LIKE THIS FOREVER--

1162
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:56,458
HAPPY, LOVING.

1163
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,125
YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE UP
YOUR MIND TO ACCEPT IT.

1164
01:14:58,208 --> 01:14:59,500
TRY, TENCHI.

1165
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:01,291
WE CAN MAKE
A BEAUTIFUL LIFE TOGETHER.

1166
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:02,666
IT'S A--
- I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER

1167
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:04,791
HOW YOU AND I MET, HARUNA!
- ( gasps )

1168
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:24,833
- ( inhales )

1169
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,500
( growls )

1170
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:29,291
HARUNA, I AM COMING!

1171
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:34,000
( screaming )

1172
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:39,000
- ( screams )

1173
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:40,625
AAH!

1174
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:42,083
- HARUNA!

1175
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,500
- NO!

1176
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:45,708
( screams )

1177
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,500
- ( screaming )

1178
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:54,875
( screaming stops )

1179
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,708
- STOP IT, PLEASE!
- HARUNA, CALM DOWN.

1180
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:02,750
THIS IS YOUR WORLD
WE'RE IN, RIGHT?

1181
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:04,750
WHY'D YOU TRY TO DECEIVE
EVEN YOURSELF?

1182
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:06,708
THERE'S THINGS
I STILL DON'T KNOW,

1183
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,750
THINGS YOU'VE BEEN HIDING
FROM ME FROM THE BEGINNING.

1184
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:10,458
I'M RIGHT HERE WITH YOU
FACE-TO-FACE.

1185
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:11,916
WHAT ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF?

1186
01:16:13,291 --> 01:16:15,000
- NO!

1187
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:24,625
- HARUNA!

1188
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:34,666
- Young Yosho: HARUNA.

1189
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,375
HARUNA.

1190
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:42,791
WE'VE ARRIVED, HARUNA.

1191
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:45,125
WE'RE HERE.
- SO THIS IS EARTH?

1192
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:47,791
IT'S RADIANT.
WE REALLY DID IT, YOSHO.

1193
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,875
- YES.

1194
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:51,833
THE AIR AND WATER
ARE FRESH HERE.

1195
01:16:51,916 --> 01:16:53,750
THEY'LL CURE YOU
IN NO TIME.

1196
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:56,166
JUST HANG ON
A LITTLE LONGER.

1197
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,458
- I CAN'T, YOSHO.
I'M SORRY.

1198
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:00,625
I'LL NEVER SURVIVE
THE LANDING.

1199
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:02,625
MY JOURNEY IS OVER.

1200
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:05,166
- HARUNA, WE MADE IT.
WE'VE COME ALL THIS WAY.

1201
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,041
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP NOW.

1202
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:08,791
- YOSHO, I'M HAPPY

1203
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:11,083
BECAUSE WE DID
WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO.

1204
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:12,625
AND WE'RE TOGETHER.

1205
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:14,458
- FORGIVE ME.

1206
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:16,708
IF I HADN'T TAKEN YOU AWAY,
THIS NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

1207
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:18,416
YOU'D STILL BE HEALTHY
AND FULL OF LIFE.

1208
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:22,083
I WISH WE'D
STAYED ON JURAI.

1209
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:24,750
- WE COULDN'T LOVE
 EACH OTHER THERE.

1210
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:27,541
AND NOW WE'VE HAD THIS
WONDROUS JOURNEY TOGETHER.

1211
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:29,750
I DON'T REGRET
ANYTHING, YOSHO.

1212
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:31,666
I CHERISHED EVERY
MOMENT WITH YOU. 

1213
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,041
( sighs )

1214
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:34,625
HOW LOVELY IT IS.

1215
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:36,625
YOU CHOSE SUCH
A PERFECT PLANET

1216
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:38,041
FOR US TO LIVE ON.

1217
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:39,416
I CAN IMAGINE
HOW OUR LIVES

1218
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,333
WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO PEACEFUL...

1219
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:42,875
( strained )
AND SO FULL OF JOY.

1220
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,708
( coughs )

1221
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:46,666
- HARUNA!

1222
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,208
- HOLD MY HAND.

1223
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:50,333
- MY LOVE.

1224
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:59,791
- DO YOU LOVE ME EVEN NOW?

1225
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,666
- MORE THAN EVER.

1226
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,166
- AND WILL YOU LOVE ME FOREVER
THROUGHOUT ALL TIME?

1227
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:05,666
- YOU KNOW I WILL.

1228
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:08,250
- YES, ARE HEARTS
WILL BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

1229
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:11,625
- I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU
RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE.

1230
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:13,166
- THEN I'M CONTENT.

1231
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,708
JUST THINK WHAT OUR LIVES
WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE

1232
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,250
ON THAT SHIMMERING PLANET.

1233
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:19,625
TIME SLIPPING AWAY
AS ONE SWEET DAY

1234
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:21,875
FLOWED INTO ANOTHER.

1235
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:23,875
- IT WILL BE LIKE THAT,
MY LOVE.

1236
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,916
JUST HANG ON
A LITTLE LONGER.

1237
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
YOU CAN DO IT.

1238
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:32,458
WE'LL LIVE TOGETHER,
YOU AND I,

1239
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,041
FOREVER,
IN A WORLD OF OUR OWN.

1240
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,458
AND WE'LL BE SO HAPPY.

1241
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:49,333
- ( sniffling )

1242
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:54,291
- HARUNA, ARE YOU--

1243
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:55,833
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, HARUNA?

1244
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:59,041
- ( cries )

1245
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:00,125
- HUH?

1246
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:10,083
OH.

1247
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:19,291
- THE PARALLEL WORLD
IS DESTABILIZING.

1248
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:21,250
ALL PARAMETERS ARE SHIFTING.

1249
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:23,958
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN, MISS WASHU?

1250
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:26,875
- IT'S COLLAPSING ON ITSELF,
AND IT'S GOING FAST.

1251
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:29,708
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT
LORD TENCHI, MISS WASHU?

1252
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,291
- REMEMBER, I SAID THIS WORLD

1253
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:32,916
IS LIKE A REFLECTION
IN A MIRROR.

1254
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,791
IF THE MIRROR GOES DARK,
TENCHI WILL CEASE TO EXIST.

1255
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:38,625
- NO, IT CAN'T BE.
WE'VE GOT TO STOP IT.

1256
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:41,500
I CAN'T LOSE TENCHI LIKE THIS
INTO A VOID OF NOTHINGNESS!

1257
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:43,125
- Washu: I KNOW HOW
YOU FEEL, AYEKA,

1258
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,625
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

1259
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:46,333
IT'S IN THE HANDS OF FATE.

1260
01:19:58,708 --> 01:20:01,500
- HARUNA,
DO YOU RECOGNIZE ME?

1261
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:03,000
- ( groans )

1262
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,250
YES.
YES, OF COURSE.

1263
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:11,541
ONLY A FEW MOMENTS AGO,
I SAW YOU IN MY DREAM. 

1264
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:13,791
- NO, YOU HAVE
 IT BACKWARDS.

1265
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,875
THAT WAS NOT
A DREAM AT ALL.

1266
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:17,666
IT WAS A MEMORY
OF OUR PAST.

1267
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,958
THE REAL PAST WHERE
AN EXTRAORDINARY GIRL

1268
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:21,541
DIED BECAUSE OF ME.

1269
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:24,583
- OH, IT WASN'T
YOUR FAULT, YOSHO.

1270
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:27,083
YOU TRIED.  I JUST
COULDN'T MAKE THE JOURNEY.

1271
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:34,208
- YOU WILL RETURN TENCHI,
MY GRANDSON, TO ME.

1272
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:35,375
WON'T YOU, HARUNA?

1273
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,208
- I'M SO SORRY, TENCHI.

1274
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:51,416
YOU SEE,
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE

1275
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,041
WHO FORGOT ABOUT
HIS OWN WORLD.

1276
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:54,583
I FORGOT ABOUT
MINE AS WELL. 

1277
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:57,208
I HAD DREAMED OF LIVING WITH
THE MAN I LOVED

1278
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:58,708
AND THAT DREAM CAME TO LIFE.

1279
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:00,583
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU,
I SWEAR.

1280
01:21:00,666 --> 01:21:04,041
- I KNOW.  I WISH
I COULD HAVE HELPED YOU MORE

1281
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,541
BY UNDERSTANDING WHAT
YOU HAD GONE THROUGH.

1282
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:09,583
- YOU DID HELP.
SHE REMEMBERS WHO SHE IS NOW.

1283
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:11,250
AND SHE'S RECOVERED
HER SPIRIT.

1284
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,541
THAT WAS YOUR DOING.

1285
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:14,958
THANK YOU, TENCHI.

1286
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:28,666
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE

1287
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,708
WAITING FOR YOU
BACK IN YOUR OWN WORLD.

1288
01:21:30,791 --> 01:21:32,541
RETURN NOW TO THE PLACE
YOU CALL HOME.

1289
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:35,625
- UH-HUH, AND WILL THINGS BE
THE WAY THEY WERE BEFORE?

1290
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:37,708
- THEY WILL.
- TENCHI,

1291
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:39,416
REMEMBER THIS?

1292
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,375
I'LL ALWAYS TREASURE IT.

1293
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:45,000
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I--
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU, HARUNA.

1294
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:46,916
- YES, YOU WILL.
YOU MUST.

1295
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,625
LET THE MEMORY FADE AWAY 
TILL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT

1296
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:51,708
BUT A WARM FEELING
IN YOUR HEART.

1297
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:54,041
- HARUNA, WAIT, PLEASE.

1298
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:56,875
- LET GO.  IT'S TIME.

1299
01:22:33,166 --> 01:22:35,208
- RYOKO, YOU HEARD HER.

1300
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:37,291
THE PARALLEL WORLD
IS DESTABILIZED.

1301
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:39,000
YOU CAN GO TO HIM.

1302
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:41,333
MAYBE YOU CAN BRING HIM BACK
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

1303
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:43,416
- FORGET IT.

1304
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,666
HE'LL NEVER COME BACK
TO US ANYWAY, AYEKA. 

1305
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:48,166
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
YOU JUST CAN'T GIVE UP.

1306
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:52,166
HE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT WORLD IS DYING.

1307
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:55,083
- UGH!  HE WANTED
TO BE WITH HER.

1308
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:56,333
SO BE IT.

1309
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:58,416
- ( scoffs )

1310
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,541
NO, YOU DON'T REALLY
MEAN THAT.

1311
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:04,166
OH, THAT'S NOT
LIKE YOU AT ALL, RYOKO.

1312
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:07,083
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
TO BELIEVE IN TENCHI.

1313
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:10,250
REMEMBER?  YOU SAID
TO NEVER GIVE UP.

1314
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:12,916
- HMPH!  LOOK, AYEKA,
YOU CAN GO IF YOU WANT.

1315
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,375
- UH... I WISH I COULD
BE THE ONE, OF COURSE.

1316
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:19,541
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN REACH HIM, RYOKO.

1317
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:20,833
YOU KNOW THAT.
- HUH?

1318
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:22,833
- ( Washu typing )

1319
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:25,125
- NO, HE'S PROBABLY
FORGOTTEN ABOUT US AGAIN.

1320
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:26,541
THAT'S THE WHOLE TROUBLE.

1321
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:29,083
- BUT IF THE PARALLEL WORLD
IS SHIFTING NOW,

1322
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:30,416
THAT COULD ALL CHANGE.

1323
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,375
HE MAY ACTUALLY
BE SEARCHING FOR US.

1324
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:34,666
WHAT IF HE NEEDED OUR HELP
AND WE WEREN'T THERE,

1325
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,583
WITH THAT WHOLE
WORLD COLLAPSING.

1326
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:38,208
- YES, YOU MAY
BE RIGHT, AYEKA.

1327
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:39,458
WITH THE SHIFTING
ENERGY LEVELS,

1328
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:40,666
SOMEONE MAY BE ABLE
TO GET IN

1329
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,708
AND BRING TENCHI
BACK TO OUR WORLD.

1330
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:44,208
WHAT DO YOU SAY, RYOKO?

1331
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:46,541
I CAN TRANSFER ONE PERSON.
IT'LL BE TIGHT.

1332
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:48,500
- UH...

1333
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:50,250
- YOU'VE GOT
TO DO IT, RYOKO.

1334
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:52,833
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

1335
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:54,833
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE HIM
ANY MORE THAN I DO.

1336
01:23:54,916 --> 01:23:57,250
SO IF THERE'S A CHANCE,
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE IT. 

1337
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:58,833
BE TRUE TO YOUR 
FEELINGS, RYOKO,

1338
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:00,083
OR YOU'LL LOSE YOURSELF.

1339
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:02,000
- ( exhales deeply )

1340
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:06,333
HMM.  HMM.

1341
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:37,291
THERE-- TENCHI.

1342
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:57,083
- ( zapping )

1343
01:24:57,166 --> 01:24:58,750
- IT'S HAPPENING.

1344
01:25:01,791 --> 01:25:02,916
BAH!

1345
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,875
- NICE FLIP.
YOU OKAY, RYOKO?

1346
01:25:05,958 --> 01:25:07,625
- YOU NEED TO WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

1347
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:09,708
YOU KNOW?
- RIGHT, SORRY.

1348
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:12,375
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S REALLY YOU AGAIN, ISN'T IT?

1349
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:14,125
I MEAN, YOU CAN RECOGNIZE
ME AND ALL?

1350
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:17,708
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, MAKING YOU WORRY.

1351
01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:22,333
- WHERE'S HARUNA?
 IS SHE IN THERE?

1352
01:25:22,416 --> 01:25:24,291
- NO, SHE'S GONE.

1353
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:26,500
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT HARUNA ANY LONGER.

1354
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:27,791
THAT'S ALL OVER NOW.

1355
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,500
( sighs )

1356
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,666
- ( sighs )

1357
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:39,250
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I CAME BACK HERE.

1358
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:41,000
I WASN'T GOING TO.

1359
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:42,458
WHEN YOU SENT US BACK,
I THOUGHT,

1360
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:44,500
"THAT'S IT FOR TENCHI,
FOR GOOD."

1361
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:46,833
I WAS GOING TO FORGET
ALL ABOUT YOU.

1362
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:53,000
- I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM.

1363
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:54,541
- HUH?

1364
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:56,833
- I KNOW I CAN ALWAYS
COUNT ON YOU, RYOKO. 

1365
01:25:56,916 --> 01:25:58,083
YOU UNDERSTAND ME.

1366
01:25:58,166 --> 01:26:00,875
- ( sighs )
- THANKS FOR COMING.

1367
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:02,875
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT.

1368
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:05,333
- WELL, DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
TAKE YOU BACK OR ANYTHING.

1369
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:07,500
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU
WEREN'T EMBARRASSING YOURSELF,

1370
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:08,958
FORGETTING WHO YOU ARE
AND ALL THAT.

1371
01:26:09,041 --> 01:26:10,416
- HEY, LET'S GO HOME.

1372
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,333
LATER ON, WE CAN TALK.

1373
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:45,208
- TENCHI, YOU REALIZE

1374
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:47,041
THIS IS THE VERY LAST TIME
YOU'LL SEE THIS WORLD.

1375
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:50,916
- I KNOW.
AND IT'S TIME

1376
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,583
TO LEAVE IT
ALL BEHIND ME.

1377
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,083
- ( instrumental music playing )

1378
01:27:23,166 --> 01:27:25,833
( music continues )

1379
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,208
- REST IN PEACE, HARUNA.

1380
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:49,916
- ( cloth flaps )
- HMM?

1381
01:27:52,541 --> 01:27:55,416
ITSUKI, DON'T BE JEALOUS.

1382
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,916
- ( leaves rustling )
- ( girls laughing ) 

1383
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,500
- Ryoko: AND THAT'S
HOW IT ENDED.

1384
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:07,708
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )
- Ryoko: SURPRISING HOW QUICKLY

1385
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:09,500
WE WENT BACK
TO EVERYDAY LIFE.

1386
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:11,750
- Mihoshi: I BET THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE REALLY TASTY.

1387
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,625
OOH, I CAN'T WAIT.
- YEAH.

1388
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:15,916
- I'M HUNGRY.

1389
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
- Sasami: YOU'RE ALWAYS
HUNGRY, MIHOSHI.

1390

- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

1391
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:23,125

01:28:23,208 --> 01:28:24,500
- HMM.
- YEAH!

1393
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:26,583
- WOW, THEY LOOK DELICIOUS.

1394
01:28:26,666 --> 01:28:29,458
SASAMI,
CAN I HAVE ONE, PLEASE?

1395
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:32,125
- WATCH OUT.  YOU'RE GOING
TO BURN YOURSELF, MIHOSHI.

1396
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:34,250
- WHERE'S LORD TENCHI?

1397
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:36,250
- I SAW HIM CLIMBING UP
THE HILL BEHIND THE HOUSE

1398
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:37,833
JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

1399
01:28:37,916 --> 01:28:40,083
- HMM.

1400
01:28:40,166 --> 01:28:41,458
- Mihoshi: I HAVE TO EAT!

1401
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:55,083
- Ryoko: TENCHI.

1402
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:57,708
- RYOKO?

1403
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,541
- I THOUGHT
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

1404
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:02,708
- DID YOU THINK
I'D DISAPPEAR AGAIN?

1405
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:04,208
- WELL, IF YOU DID,

1406
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:05,958
I'D JUST DRAG YOU
RIGHT BACK.

1407
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:07,375
- NICE TO KNOW.

1408
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:09,333
HUH?

1409
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:11,708
WHAT?

1410
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:13,833
- HMM, NOTHING.

1411
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:16,000
I THINK I LIKE YOU
THIS WAY.

1412
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:17,791
- ( grunts )

1413
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:19,708
RYOKO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

1414
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:21,541
- ( giggles )

1415
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:23,625
ARE YOU MAD?
- HUH?

1416
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:27,208
- I DON'T THINK I'D MIND
IF YOU GOT ANGRY.

1417
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:29,750
- INCREDIBLE.

1418
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:32,458
THAT IS NOT LIKE YOU
AT ALL, RYOKO.

1419
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:36,500
- HMM.

1420
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:39,333
SO THEN, I SEE
YOU'VE TAKEN UP DRAWING.

1421
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,500
- YEAH, I WAS THINKING

1422
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:43,500
HOW MY FATHER USED TO DRAW
WHEN HE WAS MY AGE,

1423
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:45,625
BUT THEN HE STOPPED
DOING IT, YOU KNOW?

1424
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:47,333
I LIKE THE WAY
IT MAKES ME FEEL.

1425
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:51,166
- GOTCHA.
AND HOW DO YOU FEEL?

1426
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:53,916
- LIKE I'M REMEMBERING SOMETHING
I FORGOT LONG AGO.

1427
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,833
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.
WHEN I DRAW,

1428
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:57,458
I FEEL THINGS
I LOST TOUCH WITH,

1429
01:29:57,541 --> 01:29:59,833
BUT ARE STILL THERE
INSIDE MY HEART.

1430
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:02,250
- TENCHI.

1431
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,083
- ( end theme playing )

1432
01:30:49,416 --> 01:30:52,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

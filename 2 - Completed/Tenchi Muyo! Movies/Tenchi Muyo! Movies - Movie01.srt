1
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,958
- ( machine whirs )

2
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,875
- ( buzzer blares )
- HUH?

3
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:53,916
RED ALERT!
RED ALERT!

4
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,166
- ( people scream )

5
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,458
- ( gasping )

6
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:37,916
- Officer: HUH? WHAT THE
HELL'S GOING ON HERE?!

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,291
- THERE'S AN ANOMALY
IN THE SUBSPACE ROOM.

8
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,833
CONVENTIONAL
SPACE AND TIME

9
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,791
ARE BOTH BEING DRAWN
INTO THE CORE BLOCK.

10
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,208
- COMMANDER,
THINK YOU COULD--

11
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,000
- IT'S KAIN!
HE'S THE ONLY ONE

12
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,166
WHO CAN DO SOMETHING
SO IMPOSSIBLE!

13
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,208
- Woman:
DIMENSIONAL SHIELD BREACHED!

14
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,833
CLIMAX IS OUT OF ALIGNMENT.

15
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,250
SPACE-TIME'S BEGUN
MOVING INTO THE PAST.

16
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,208
- HE MUSTN'T GET AWAY!

17
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,208
- SIR, THE SUBSPACE ANOMALY
IS OUT OF CONTROL.

18
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,375
IF IT KEEPS GOING
AT THIS RATE,

19
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,500
IT'S GONNA TEAR
HEADQUARTERS

20
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,750
COMPLETELY TO PIECES.

21
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,416
- COMMANDER!
- WHAT?

22
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,875
- ( screams )

23
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,416
- ( alarm buzzes ) 
- ( gags )

24
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,750
OH, WHY DOES HEADQUARTERS
ALWAYS CALL WHEN I'M EATING?

25
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,166
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
FORGOT TO FILE A REPORT AGAIN?

26
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,583
- ( Man through P.A. ):
ATTENTION ALL UNITS,

A-1 CLASS CRIMINAL KAIN.

29
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,041
- Mihoshi: OH, KIYONE.

30
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,250
- HEADQUARTERS, CAN 
YOU COME IN, PLEASE?

31
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,958
THIS IS DETECTIVE FIRST-CLASS
KIYONE IN THE SAUL SYSTEM.

32
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,875
PLEASE REPEAT YOUR 
LAST MESSAGE, OVER.

33
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,166
HEADQUARTERS, COME IN!
WHAT'S HAPPENED?!

34
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,291
PLEASE REPEAT
YOUR LAST TRANSMISSION.

35
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,375
- ( screams )

36
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,000
- OH NO, MIHOSHI,
WHAT WAS THAT?

37
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,583
- Man #1: LOOK AT THAT,
THE AURORA BOREALIS.

38
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,750
- Man #2:
YEAH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

39
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,166
- ( overlapping chatter )

40
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,125
- UH, WHAT?

41
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,750
( grunts )

42
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,791
WHAT'S GOING ON?

43
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,250
UH...

44
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,916
( screams )

45
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,250
THIS WAS THE FIRST
INDICATION I HAD

46
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,791
THAT I WAS GOING TO VANISH.

47
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,875
- Girl #1: HEY, WAIT UP.
- Boy #1: ( laughs ) 

48
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,625
- Boy #2: YOU GUYS GOT
PRACTICE LATER.

49
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,041
- Girl #2: YOU GUYS,
I'LL SEE YOU OVER THERE.

50
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,625
- Boy #3: CATCH YOU
AFTER SCHOOL, MAN. 

51
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,666
- ( no audio )

52
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,708
- ( no audio )

53
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,208
- ( no audio )

54
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,416
- ( no audio )

55

- ( no audio )

57
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,791
- ( no audio )

58
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,541
- ( film projector clicking )

59
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,458
- EIGHT MILLIMETER FILM?
- YUP.

60
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,083
PEOPLE USED IT TO
MAKE HOME MOVIES.

61
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,166
- HMM.

62
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,375
- YEAH, MY FATHER
ALWAYS LOVED IT

63
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,125
WHEN HE COULD FOOL AROUND
WITH THE LATEST GADGETS. 

64
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,083
IN FACT, THIS IS A FILM

65
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,791
THAT HE SHOT
QUITE SOME TIME AGO.

66
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,291
- Girls: OH.

67
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,833
- WELL, IT WAS
A PRETTY SNEAKY WAY

68
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,708
TO PICK UP MY MOM,
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT.

69
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,791
- HUH?  YOU MEAN THE GIRL
THAT WE'VE BEEN WATCHING

70
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,708
IS YOUR MOTHER?
- YEP.

71
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:08,791
- Girls: OH!

72
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,541
- SHE'S NOTHING BUT A CHILD.

73
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,958
- OF COURSE SHE IS.

74
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,500
WHEN THEY SHOT THIS FILM,

75
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,750
SHE WAS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL!
- EXCUSE ME.

76
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,833
- SHE'S GREAT.

77
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,541
- OF COURSE, YOU'VE GOT
TO REMEMBER, SASAMI,

78
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,541
THAT TENCHI'S MOTHER
IS DESCENDED

79
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,166
FROM THE EMPEROR JURAI.

80
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,666
- HEY, THAT'S WEIRD.

81
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,583
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HAVE JURAI BLOOD TOO,

82
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,916
DIDN'T YOU?
- UH-HUH.

83
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,875
WHAT ABOUT IT?
- WHAT THE-- HEY!

84
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,041
CAN'T YOU TAKE A JOKE?
GIVE ME SOME COOKIES. 

85
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,125
- Ayeka: THEY'RE TOO GOOD
TO WASTE ON YOU.

86
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,541
- Ryoko: COOKIE HOG. THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE FOR ALL OF US.

87
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,708
- SHE LOOKS VERY GENTLE.
- SHE WAS.

88
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,416
- HEY!

89
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,541
HUH?!  AAH!

90
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,125
AH!  WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

91
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,208
( groaning )

92
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,791
OH!

93
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,875
- HE JUST WENT FLYING.

94
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,875
- LORD TENCHI!
- YOU BADLY HURT?

95
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,625
- WHAT ARE YOU 
DOING UP THERE?

96
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,250
- Washu: WELL, WELL, WELL.

97
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,166
I CAN SEE ONCE AGAIN
I MADE IT JUST IN TIME.

98
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,166
THE PROBLEM'S IN THE PAST.
- ( all gasp )

99
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,750
- AND HERE'S THE PROOF.

100
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,208
CHECK THIS OUT.

101
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,250
- ( gasping )

102
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,583
- SHE'S GONE!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

103
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,250
TENCHI'S MOTHER'S
DISAPPEARED.

104
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,583
- HUH?
- YES, AND HERE! AND HERE!

105
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,500
AND HERE!  AND HERE!

106
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,041
- WASHU, WHAT'S GOING ON?

107
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,000
- ( rumbling )
- ( gasping ) 

108
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,625
- Washu:
IT IS AS I FEARED.

109
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,750
26 YEARS AGO,
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED

110
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,208
TO LORD TENCHI'S MOTHER,
SOMETHING AWFUL.

111
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,833
THE MASAKI FAMILY DIED OUT.

112
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,500
- WHAT?!
- THAT MEANS IN THIS WORLD,

113
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,500
LORD TENCHI HAS 
NEVER BEEN BORN.

114
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,750
- BUT WAIT, HOW COME 
WE'RE ALL STILL HERE?

115
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,875
- THERE IS ONLY ONE THING
IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE

116
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,833
THAT STANDS BETWEEN YOU
AND OBLIVION.

117
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,500
THE MOST BRILLIANT MIND
IN THE GALAXY!

118
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,083
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HER!

119
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,583
I WAS WORKING IN MY 
SUBSPACE LABORATORY

120
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,666
WHEN I SUDDENLY MONITORED
A TEMPORAL MISALIGNMENT.

121
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,833
SOMETHING HAS CAUSED
THE TIMELINE

122
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,791
REVOLVING AROUND
THE MISAKI FAMILY TO SHIFT.

123
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,625
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING,

124
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,541
IT WON'T BE JUST TENCHI'S
HISTORY THAT CHANGES.

125
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,375
IT'LL BE OURS TOO.

126
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,625
- THIS IS TOO EXCITING.
- NO!  NO!

127
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,083
- COME ON, GIVE ME A COOKIE!
- NO!

128
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,541
- Washu: FOR NOW,
THE SHIELD I'VE PUT

129
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,333
AROUND LORD TENCHI
IS PROTECTING HIM 

130
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,750
FROM THE SHIFT,
SO YOU ARE ALL PROTECTED.

131
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,291
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN KEEP

132
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,208
THE TIME SHIELD UP
INDEFINITELY.

133
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,958
AND WHEN IT FINALLY COLLAPSES,
HE WILL DISAPPEAR.

134
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,208
- SO THAT MEANS...
- TENCHI.

135
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,208
- OH.

136
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,000
- OH, YOU MUST BE KIDDING.

137
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,833
- I WISH I WAS, RYOKO.

138
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,375
- THEN TELL ME,
WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED

139
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,916
TO TENCHI'S MOTHER?!

140
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,500
- I'M SORRY, BUT I TOLD
YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW.

141
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,333
- SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE
ISN'T ANYTHING WE CAN DO

142
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,708
TO HELP HIM,
THAT IT?!

143
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:51,250
- WASHU, PLEASE.
- MISS WASHU.

144
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,625
- WELL, THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I CAN THINK OF.

145
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,833
- TELL ME, WASHU.
WHAT IS IT?

146
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,291
- WELL, TO START WITH,
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

147
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,208
TO TRAVEL BACK IN TIME
26 YEARS.

148
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,250
AND THEN OUR TASK
IS QUITE SIMPLE.

149
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,416
MAKE SURE NOTHING HAPPENS
TO TENCHI'S MOTHER.

150
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,375
- ( train whistles loudly )
- ( wheels clacking )

151
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,625
- ( sighs )
THAT PART-TIME JOB OF MINE

152
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,791
IS REALLY WEARING ME OUT.

153
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,916
- YOU BETTER GET TO SLEEP,
SO WE CAN GET AN EARLY START.

154
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,791
HUH?

155
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,333
- ( light snores )

156
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,916
- ASLEEP ALREADY.

157
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,250
AT LEAST THAT'S ONE THING

158
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,458
YOU'VE NEVER HAD
ANY TROUBLE DOING RIGHT.

159
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,500
- ( Mihoshi snores lightly )

160
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,583
- Captain: ATTENTION ALL UNITS!

161
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,250
INSTITUTE EMERGENCY
PROCEDURES AT ONCE!

162
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,833
A-1 CLASS CRIMINAL KAIN...

163
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,125
- HEADQUARTERS,
CAN YOU PLEASE...

164
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,791
I WONDER WHAT THAT
EMERGENCY SIGNAL WAS ALL ABOUT.

165
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,375
IT WAS SO STRANGE.

166
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,000
( gasps )

167
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,625
- GOOD EVENING.
( cackles )

168
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,958
- WHAT IS IT?

169
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,041
- IT'S TIME TO GO, KIYONE.

170
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,541
- HUH?  AHH!

171
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,791
- ( machine whirs )
- EVERYBODY READY?

172
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,541
USING MY
CHRONOMETRIC REGULATOR,

173
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,833
I INTEND TO SEND YOU ALL
26 YEARS INTO THE PAST. 

174
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,958
OF COURSE THE PROCEDURE
IS STILL HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL.

175
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:36,083
HOWEVER, IF YOU FOLLOW
MY INSTRUCTIONS,

176
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,833
THEN YOU'LL BE FINE.

177
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,625
I'M STILL COMPILING THE DATA

178
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,291
ON WHAT HAPPENS TO
LORD TENCHI'S MOTHER.

179
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,833
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT TENCHI

180
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,000
NOT CONTACT HIS MOTHER
ONCE HE ARRIVES.

181
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,291
THAT WOULD BE DANGEROUS.

182
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,708
THE CHANCES OF A TIME PARADOX

183
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,541
ARE VERY, VERY HIGH.

184
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,291
- ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS GOING TO WORK?

185
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,791
- NOTHING VENTURED,
NOTHING GAINED, RIGHT?

186
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,125
- I REALLY HATE TO
PUT YOU THROUGH ALL THIS.

187
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,666
- THAT'S GREAT,
BUT WHY DO WE ALL

188
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,625
HAVE TO GET
MIXED UP IN THIS MESS?

189
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,583
- ( snoring )

190
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,458
- I'M GETTING REALLY DIZZY.

191
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,083
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

192
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,333
YOU JUST MAKE SURE
THAT WHEN YOU GET BACK THERE,

193
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,000
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

194
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,583
DON'T THROW HISTORY OFF
ANY MORE THAN IT ALREADY IS.

195
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,541
- OKAY, WE HEARD IT
THE FIRST TIME.

196
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,875
- Washu: THAT GOES DOUBLE
FOR YOU, RYOKO.

197
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,166
IT'S TIME TO ACCELERATE.
- Ayeka: WHAT?

198
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,833
- Tenchi: ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- Ryoko: HOLD IT, WASHU, WAIT!

199
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,791
- Sasami: I'M GONNA THROW UP!
- Kiyone: STOP THIS, PLEASE! 

200
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,041
- Washu: HERE IT GOES.

201
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,833
- ( all scream )

202
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,541
- Tenchi: AND SO OUR
JOURNEY BACK IN TIME

203
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,000
TO SAVE THE FUTURE BEGAN.

204
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,583
- TODAY WE'RE LOOKING AT
THE DEMON OF THE RASHOMON,

205
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,625
THE FOURTH STORY IN
THE COLLECTION OF TALES

206
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,041
CALLED THE UJI SHUI MONOGATARI.

207
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,458
THIS IS A STORY
OF A TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIP

208
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,916
BETWEEN A WARRIOR,
A DEMON, AND A PRINCESS.

209
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,291
- Noboyuki: UH, MISS.
- YES, WHAT IS IT?

210
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,583
- WE, UH-- WE ALREADY
DID THAT STORY.

211
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,041
- AHH!

212
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,416
OH, MY.

213
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,708
THAT'S THE ONLY
EARTH STORY THAT I KNOW.

214
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,250
WHAT'LL I DO?

215
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,666
- THAT IDIOT.

216
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,791
- ( bell rings )

217
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,083
- ( students chatter )

218
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,083
- HEY, AYEKA.
- WHAT NOW?

219
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,875
- LOOK OVER THERE.
THAT'S TENCHI'S OLD MAN.

220
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,958
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH TENCHI
LOOKS LIKE HIM AT THIS AGE.

221
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:04,708
- HMM, WELL, THEN THIS
IS YOUR BIG OPPORTUNITY, RIGHT?

222
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,958
FATHER IS STILL AVAILABLE.

223
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,333
- NOT THAT FILTHY OLD MAN
THAT HE BECAME

224
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,125
LATER ON IN LIFE.

225
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,083
I MEAN, TENCHI'S FATHER,
STUPID, THAT WE SEE HERE

226
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,833
BACK IN THE PAST.

227
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,625
- I'VE BEEN GIVING
OUR PROBLEM SOME THOUGHT.

228
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,625
YOU SEE, IF FATHER DOESN'T
END UP MARRYING MOTHER,

229
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,916
THEN TENCHI
WILL NEVER BE BORN.

230
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,625
- YOU JUST
FIGURED THAT OUT?

231
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,250
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT,

232
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,458
WHAT'S WITH THIS "MOTHER"
AND "FATHER" THING?

233
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,833
SINCE WHEN DID THEY 
BECOME YOUR PARENTS?

234
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,333
- WELL, I WAS HOPING
WHEN WE GET BACK... 

235
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,458
- WHAT?  YOU MARRY TENCHI?!
DON'T BE STUPID.

236
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,125
- WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

237
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,041
AND WHO ARE YOU TO GO
AND CALL ME STUPID, RYOKO?

238
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,166
- I'LL CALL YOU WHAT I LIKE,
GOT IT, STUPID?

239
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,000
- ( both growl )

240
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:50,958
HUH?

241
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,958
( laughs )

242
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,500
- OH, IT'S NOTHING.
NOTHING REALLY.

243
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,875
- ( both giggle )

244
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,250
HMPH!

245
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,958
- Coach: LET'S BEGIN.
- ( whistles )

246
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,375
- I GOT IT!
- ( cheering )

247
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,666
- HEY, OVER HERE.
- AWW, I GOT IT.

248
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,541
- I'M OPEN.
- HEY, OVER HERE.

249
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,875
- ( snickers )
WELL, IT'S DIFFERENT.

250
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,791
- HMM, YES, WELL,
WHAT CAN I DO, RYOKO?

251
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,500
AFTER ALL, I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE'D BE A CLASS LIKE THIS.

252
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,333
- WELL, LIKE THEY SAY,
YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE.

253
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,458
- ( growls )
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW!

254
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,958
AT LEAST I COULD FIT INTO
ONE OF ACHIKA'S GYM SUITS,

255
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,083
UNLIKE SOMEONE I KNOW
WHO HAD TO BORROW

256
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,000
HER GYM SUIT FROM
THE GYM TEACHER. 

257
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,583
( giggles ) I'M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH THE WHOLE STORY,

258
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,333
BUT THE WORD IS THAT HE HAS
SOME SORT OF MEDICAL COMPLAINT

259
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,041
THAT IS PECULIAR TO MALES.
( laughs )

260
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,916
- ( gasps )

261
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,291
( sniffs )

262
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,416
( groans )
- ( whistles )

263
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
- UGH!
- HMM?

264
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,333
WHAT'S A MATTER WITH YOU?

265
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,708
LET'S GO!

266
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,750
- OH!  HE'S SCRATCHING HIMSELF!

267
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,375
UGH!

268
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,000
- AYEKA, GIVE ME 
ALL YOUR CLOTHES.

269
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,916
- THERE'S NO WAY.
- TAKE 'EM OFF.

270
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,916
- ( screaming )
- RIGHT NOW.

271
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,708
- STOP IT!  LEAVE ME ALONE!
- COME ON.

272
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,583
- ( both grunting )
- HUH?

273
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,625
HEY-- HEY, STOP THAT,
BOTH OF YOU.

274
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,125
STOP, LET HER GO. YOU TWO
WANT TO STAY AFTER SCHOOL?

275
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,666
- ( fighting continues )
- ( sighs )

276
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,583
THOSE TWO NEVER STOP.
THEY'RE FIGHTING AGAIN.

277
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,416
- HERE.
- THANKS A LOT.

278
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,833
YOU'RE CUTE.
TELL ME,

279
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,291
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
LITTLE GIRL?

280
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,166
- WAITING FOR MY BIG SISTER.
- OH, I SEE.

281
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,708
- MM-HMM.
- HUH.

282
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:05,916
- UH-OH.

283
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,541
- HUH?

284
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,000
- Female student:
ACHIKA, COME ON. 

285
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,750
- UH, COMING.

286
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,208
SEE YOU.
THANKS AGAIN.

287
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,541
- SURE. 
BYE-BYE.

288
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,916
HUH?
- WOW, THAT WAS CLOSE.

289
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,958
- YEAH, WASHU'S GONNA
BE REALLY ANGRY.

290
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,166
- ( gasps )

291
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,916
I KNEW IT WOULD BE
DANGEROUS HERE,

292
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,916
BUT SHE WAS
SO CLOSE THAT--

293
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,708
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID.

294
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,208
I JUST HAD TO 
SEE HER AGAIN.

295
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,500
- OF COURSE YOU DID.

296
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,333
- ( laughs ) SHH.

297
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,666
SASAMI, DON'T TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

298
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,875
- SURE.

299
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,750
- READY.

300
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,916
( laughs )
GOOD ONE! 

301
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,458
- MOTHER.

302
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
- ( sighs )

303
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,750
MY SCHOOL'S SO FAR AWAY.

304
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,750
GETTING HOME JUST SEEMS
TO TAKE FOREVER.

305
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,625
I'M HOME!

306
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,083
OH, I'M SO HUNGRY.

307
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,500
I'LL FIX DINNER RIGHT-- HUH?

308
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,416
- HMM?

309
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,250
- YOU'RE, UH-- UH...
- HI.

310
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,708
- ( giggles ) I HOPE
WE'RE NOT PUTTING YOU OUT.

311
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:09,291
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- AH, YES, FATHER.

312
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,416
I'M FINE,
JUST SURPRISED.

313
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,916
- WELL, I CAN
UNDERSTAND THAT.

314
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,875
AS IT HAPPENS,
YOUR SCHOOL CALLED TODAY.

315
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,208
THIS IS AYEKA AND RYOKO.

316
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,750
I AGREED TO LET 
THEM BOARD HERE.

317
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,041
THEY'RE GONNA BE STAYING
WITH US FOR A WHILE.

318
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,958
- REALLY?  HOW EXCITING.

319
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,291
THEY JUST TRANSFERRED IN TODAY.

320
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,041
IN FACT, BOTH OF THEM
ARE IN MY CLASS.

321
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,750
- HUH, WELL, APPARENTLY
THEY LIVE SUCH A LONG WAY

322
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,541
FROM THE SCHOOL
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM

323
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,458
TO COMMUTE FROM HOME EVERY DAY.
- ( Ayeka giggles )

324
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,000
I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE.
- SURE THING.

325
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,333
- IT'S MY PLEASURE.

326
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,708
- AH, MY, THIS IS
QUITE WONDERFUL. 

327
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,375
MY POOR ACHIKA
HAS BEEN WITHOUT COMPANY

328
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,291
FAR TOO MUCH EVER SINCE
HER DEAR MOTHER PASSED AWAY.

329
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,333
( slurps )

330
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,625
- Ryoko: HEY,
I'M STARVING OVER HERE.

331
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:55,916
IS DINNER READY YET?  HUH?
- IT'S COMING UP RIGHT AWAY.

332
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,750
- WHY DON'T YOU HELP OUT
INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING?!

333
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,416
- HUH, YOU SHOULD TALK.

334
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,208
I DON'T SEE YOU DOING ANYTHING.
- HOW DARE YOU SPEAK

335
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,416
TO ME THAT WAY!
- NOW, PLEASE DON'T FIGHT.

336
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,333
- ( knocking )

337
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:08,750
- Both: HUH?
- Achika: WHO IS THAT?

338
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,833
- IT'S JUST ME.

339
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,833
- IT'S MISS MIHOSHI.

340
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:17,666
- I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU
AT THIS HOUR,

341
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,333
BUT I'M, UH,
CONDUCTING A HOME VISIT.

342
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:23,916
- ( both groan )
- REALLY?  HOW ODD.

343
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,750
- ( groans ) HOME VISITS?
WHO DOES THAT AT THIS HOUR?

344
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,750
- THAT FOOL.  I TOLD HER
TO GO AND TAKE A LOOK

345
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,166
WITHOUT MAKING
ANYONE SUSPICIOUS.

346
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,041
- OH, GOOD.

347
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,625
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S MANAGED
TO GET INTO THE HOUSE, ANYWAY.

348
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,875
- WELL, <i>BON APPETIT.</i>

349
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:50,958
- Ayeka: HMM, THIS IS WONDERFUL.
- THIS IS VERY STRANGE, VERY.

350
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,458
- WELL, I MUST ADMIT.

351
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,375
YOU ALL DID A GREAT JOB
OF GETTING INTO THE HOUSE

352
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:58,875
WITHOUT AROUSING
ANY SUSPICIONS. 

353
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,041
- I SUPPOSE.
( giggles ) 

354
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,125
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK IT WAS

355
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,291
THAT LITTLE BIT OF PERFUME
I BORROWED FROM WASHU.

356
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,625
- Ryoko: BEING SNEAKY
COMES NATURALLY, HMM?

357
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,750
- HUH?!  ALL RIGHT, RYOKO,
WHAT WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!

358
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,041
- ALL RIGHT.  ALL RIGHT.

359
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:15,125
ANYWAY, WE'VE MANAGED TO
ALL GET SAFELY BACK HERE

360
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,708
TO 1970.

361
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,500
- RIGHT.

362
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,041
BUT HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY
TRY TO SAVE TENCHI'S MOTHER

363
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,791
WHEN WE DON'T KNOW
THE DANGER SHE FACES.

364
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,208
- ( Sasami laughs ) 
- ( Ryo-ohki meows )

365
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,000
- HERE IT IS.

366
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:30,041
I GOT A MESSAGE
FROM WASHU!

367
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,333
- SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ALL
GOT THERE SAFELY.

368
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,500
- OF COURSE.
WHY NOT?

369
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,166
- WELL, I MUST SAY
THIS TIME TRAVEL

370
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,041
BY FIXING THE POSITION
OF THE TIME AXIS

371
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,500
WAS MORE DIFFICULT
THAN I THOUGHT.

372
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:51,500
HUH, IN FACT,
TO TELL YOU GUYS THE TRUTH,

373
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,166
I WASN'T 100% CERTAIN
IT WAS GONNA WORK.

374
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,666
- ( all gasp )

375
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,833
- Ayeka: SO YOU MEAN TO SAY

376
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:00,041
THAT IF YOU HAD MADE
EVEN ONE FALSE MOVE,

377
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,041
WE COULD HAVE ENDED UP WANDERING
AROUND IN TIME FOREVER?

378
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,333
- Mihoshi: THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE.

379
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,125
- Ryoko: DAMN IT, WASHU!

380
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:10,000
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
BUT AT LEAST I GOT YOU 

381
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,708
TO WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE,
DIDN'T I?

382
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:14,000
- ( all groan )

383
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,708
- WAIT UP.  UH...

384
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:20,208
MISS WASHU, I WONDER
IF YOU CAN TELL ME

385
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,958
EXACTLY WHEN AND WHERE
MY MOTHER'S GOING TO DISAPPEAR.

386
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,208
- NOT QUITE.

387
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:38,041
- HEY, ACHIKA, I'M RETURNING
THIS MAGAZINE TO YOU.

388
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,750
- TANAKA, I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU FOR DAYS. 

389
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,583
SO HOW'S YOUR COLD DOING?

390
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,500
- Tanaka: OH, MY THROAT'S
STILL KIND OF SORE,

391
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,041
BUT I GOT A TEST COMING UP
SO WHAT CAN I DO?

392
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:49,625
- ACHIKA, ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME? 

393
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,541
- YES, YES, I'M COMING.
- THIS MAGAZINE

394
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:52,875
WAS REALLY INTERESTING.

395
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,958
ESPECIALLY THIS 
PICTURE OF GORO.

396
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,458
- HMM?  REALLY,
WHICH PICTURE?

397
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,541
- THE FEATURE STORY
ON MICHIRU WAS GOOD TOO.

398
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,208
- YEAH, RIGHT,
I REMEMBER THAT.

399
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,333
I ALREADY READ IT
A COUPLE OF TIMES MYSELF.

400
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,166
- ( Washu echoes ):
ALL I CAN SAY--

401
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,333
ACHIKA'S POINT
OF DISAPPEARANCE...

402
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,375
SOMETIME WITHIN...

403
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,500
NEXT SEVEN DAYS.

404
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,541
- ( girls chatter )

405
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:35,833
- ( Washu echoes ):
KIYONE, I'VE CONFIRMED

406
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:38,541
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF
THE GALAXY POLICE HEADQUARTERS.

407
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,708
THEIR LAST TRANSMISSION

408
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:44,291
MENTIONED THE A-1 CLASS
CRIMINAL, KAIN...

409
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:47,333
- ( static fizzles )
- ( sighs )

410
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,791
- ( grunting )

411
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,458
- HEADS UP.

412
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,291
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

413
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,166
( grunts )
- WHAT YOU DOING, AYEKA?

414
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,333
HAVING A DIRT SANDWICH?
( laughs )

415
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,291
- ( growls )
- COME AND GET ME IF YOU DARE.

416
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,666
- ( growls ) SHE REALLY
GETS ON MY NERVES!

417
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,958
- ( both laugh )

418
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,583
- THAT'S FUNNY.

419
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,916
- ( Washu echoes ): LORD TENCHI,
SHIELD ENERGY LASTS

420
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,666
ONLY SEVEN MORE DAYS.
BE CAREFUL.

421
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,500
- RIGHT.

422
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,291
- ALL RIGHT, YOU MADE IT.

423
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,958
HAVE YOU TWO NOTICED
ANYTHING UNUSUAL?

424
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:36,625
- HMM.
- ANYTHING AT ALL,

425
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:39,208
NO MATTER HOW UNIMPORTANT
IT MIGHT SEEM TO YOU.

426
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:41,958
- HUH?  I HAVE SOMETHING.
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

427
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,041
- YOU KNOW THE FRIED NOODLE DISH
THEY USUALLY SERVE AT LUNCH?

428
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:46,041
WELL, IT'S THE FIRST THING
TO BE SOLD OUT,

429
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,583
BUT TODAY THERE WERE...

430
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,625
THREE-- THERE WERE THREE
PIECES LEFT OVER.

431
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,666
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY WEIRD,
DON'T YOU?

432
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,000
- WHY ME?
- WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

433
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,541
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER
INANE OBSERVATION.

434
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,625
- MM-HMM.

435
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,958
- SO TELL ME, EVERYONE, 
ARE WE ALL STILL WILLING

436
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,500
TO GO ALONG
WITH THE ASSUMPTION

437
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,083
THAT SOMETHING HORRIBLE
IS GONNA HAPPEN

438
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,916
TO TENCHI'S MOTHER?
- ( grunting )

439
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:15,250
- LORD TENCHI!
- TENCHI, WHAT'S WRONG?

440
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,250
- ( groans )

441
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,583
- Ayeka: HE'S DISAPPEARING!
- Ryoko: UH-OH.

442
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:22,708
- Kiyone: I HOPE ACHIKA'S OKAY.
- ( groans )

443
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:24,666
- WAIT ONE SECOND.
IF WE'RE ALL HERE,

444
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,666
THEN THAT MEANS THAT...
- WHO'S WITH MOTHER?

445
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,958
- OH, BOY,
THIS COULD BE REALLY BAD.

446
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:32,208
ALL RIGHT, SASAMI,

447
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:33,708
YOU'D BETTER
TAKE CARE OF TENCHI.

448
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:34,875
- RIGHT.

449
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,333
- Kiyone: HURRY, EVERYONE.

450
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,958
LET'S SPLIT UP
AND LOOK FOR HER.

451
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:45,750
- ( groans )
MOTHER!

452
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,708
- ACHIKA!

453
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,916
WHERE HAVE YOU
GOTTEN TO, ACHIKA?!

454
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,500
- HEY, ACHIKA!

455
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,458
- ACHIKA?
SORRY.

456
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,291
ACHIKA?
YOU IN HERE?

457
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,125
- Kiyone:
ANSWER ME!  PLEASE!

458
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:17,041
- Ryoko:
HEY, DID YOU FIND HER?

459
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,166
- NO, HOW ABOUT YOU, AYEKA?

460
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,416
- NO, I COULDN'T
FIND HER EITHER.

461
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,041
LET'S CHECK ON TENCHI.

462
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,083
- ( sighs )

463
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,166
EVERYTHING SEEMS
TO BE UNDER CONTROL.

464
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,750
- AT LEAST FOR NOW.

465
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:32,291
- I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR ALL THIS TROUBLE.

466
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,333
- ( meowing )
- HEY!

467
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:38,750
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- ( meowing )

468
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,458
- RYO-OHKI?
- I WONDER WHAT'S WRONG?

469
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,166
- ( meowing )

470
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,208
- Ayeka: YOU THINK SHE'S TRYING
TO TELL US SOMETHING?

471
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:47,208
- I'M NOT SURE.

472
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,250
MAYBE IT'S ACHIKA.
- ( gasps )

473
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,291
- LET'S GET GOING.

474
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,916
- ( leaves rustle )
- Achika: NOBOYUKI.

475
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,083
- HUH?  OH, ACHIKA.
- WHAT A SURPRISE.

476
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,750
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON CLEANUP TODAY.

477
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,750
WHAT'RE YOU DOING WAY UP HERE?
- OH, I-- I--

478
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,916
- OOH, WHAT'S THAT
YOU'RE DRAWING?

479
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,791
- UH-- UH-- UH,
IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

480
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:22,791
- AWW, PLEASE.
- WHAT?

481
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,833
- SHOW ME, SHOW ME.
- NO, DON'T!

482
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,708
- ( giggles )
OH.

483
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,000
WHAT IS IT?

484
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,791
- IT'S A HOUSE.
- A HOUSE?

485
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:38,791
- YOU SEE, I LOVE--
- UH-HUH?

486
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,625
- YOU SEE, I LOVE--

487
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,458
I LOVE ARCHITECTURE.

488
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:45,833
AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO BUILD
A HOUSE LIKE THIS SOMEDAY.

489
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,541
- OH.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

490
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:51,791
- ( giggles )
OH, NOTHING AT ALL REALLY.

491
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,500
- CAN I HAVE THE BOOK?

492
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:57,166
- YOU KNOW, A WINDOW MIGHT
BE NICE HERE BY THE ROOF. 

493
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,500
IT WOULD LET IN
MORE LIGHT

494
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,458
AND REALLY BRIGHTEN THINGS UP.
- WHAT?

495
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:02,125
YOU MEAN...

496
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:09,041
LIKE THIS?
- HMM?

497
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,375
MORE LIKE THAT.

498
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:17,041
- HEY, YOU SURE HAVE
EXCELLENT TASTE, ACHIKA.

499
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,833
- REALLY?  DO YOU THINK SO?
- YEAH.

500
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,416
- LISTEN, NOBOYUKI,

501
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,291
IF YOU EVER MANAGE
TO BUILD THIS HOUSE,

502
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,666
PROMISE THAT YOU'LL INVITE ME
TO COME AND SEE IT.

503
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,958
- HUH?!
- COME ON.

504
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,666
WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW?

505
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,083
- THE MATTER?
NOTHING AT ALL.

506
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,833
- ( laughs )
WHAT ABOUT ITS COLOR?

507
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:36,333
- I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
THAT FAR YET.

508
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,208
- I THINK IT SHOULD BE RED.
- ( meowing )

509
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,583
- Ryoko:
IS THIS WHERE THEY ARE?

510
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,333
WHAT WOULD THEY
BE DOING OUT HERE?

511
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,708
- ( sniffing )
- WHAT?  A RED ROOF?

512
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:46,291
- ( meowing )
- HUH?

513
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:49,208
- ( giggling )
- UH-HUH, THERE THEY ARE.

514
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:53,083
- UGH!  IGNORING THE WORLD,
ALL ALONE AND OBLIVIOUS.

515
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,583
- OH, HOW SWEET.  AWW.
- HUH?

516
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:57,500
- HMPH, THEY'RE
JUST HAVING FUN.  HUH?

517
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,708
- WHAT IS IT?

518
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:04,875
- WHAT?  NOTHING I SUPPOSE.

519
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,541
- HUH?

520
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,833
OH, MY, MY.

521
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,375
WELL THEN, LET ME SEE.

522
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,541
THE LADY ACHIKA
IS GOING TO DISAPPEAR

523
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,458
BECAUSE OF ONE OR ALL
OF THESE SEEMINGLY

524
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,041
RANDOM ELEMENTS.

525
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,916
NOW IF I COULD ONLY MANAGE
TO DEFINE THEM,

526
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,083
I'D BE ABLE TO NARROW DOWN
THE PROBABILITIES

527
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:31,375
AND ACCURATELY PREDICT
WHEN SHE WILL VANISH. 

528
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:33,708
( growls )

529
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:36,541
I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

530
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,708
- NO!

531
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:44,375
A SCHOOL STUDY TRIP!  NO!

532
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,833
- UH...

533
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:50,458
( coughs )

534
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,750
- Ryoko: WHEN?
WHEN DO WE LEAVE?

535
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,916
- WHEN?  WHAT ON EARTH 
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

536
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,041
WHY, TOMORROW OF COURSE.

537
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,083
THAT'S WHY WE ALL
DIVIDED UP INTO GROUPS.

538
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:02,125
- Both: HUH?

539
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,458
- ( film clacking )
- ( chuckles )

540
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,000
- AAH, THIS IS GREAT.

541
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,916
- SO WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO, KIYONE?

542
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,500
- WELL, FOR THE TIME BEING,

543
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,541
ALL WE CAN DO IS GO
ON THIS TRIP TOGETHER.

544
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,666
- I'M AFRAID I'LL GET LOST.

545
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,375
THERE'S JUST SO MANY PEOPLE
LIVING IN TOKYO.

546
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:00,125
- GET REAL.  DETECTIVES
IN THE GALAXY POLICE

547
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,291
DON'T JUST GET LOST.

548
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:07,125
- WHAT?  KIYONE.

549
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,833
WHERE'D YOU GO?

550
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,666
DID YOU FALL ASLEEP?

551
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,791
- ( screams )

552
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,500
- OH, DEAR, HAVE I CHOSEN

553
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,416
A BAD TIME
TO BRING YOU BACK?

554
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,375
- WASHU.

555
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,916
THE NEXT TIME THAT YOU'RE
GONNA BRING ME BACK,

556
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,291
I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D TELL ME FIRST.

557
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,833
- I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE RIGHT OF COURSE.

558
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,666
ACTUALLY, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO CHECK FOR ME.

559
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,500
- I CAN HANDLE IT.
TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU'D LIKE.

560
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:46,458
- WHEN I ANALYZED
THE ENERGY'S SIGNATURE

561
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,083
FROM THE POINT OF
ACHIKA'S DISAPPEARANCE,

562
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:49,666
I FOUND A CORRELATION.

563
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,166
IT MATCHED THE ENERGY RELEASED

564
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,333
WHEN THE GALAXY POLICE
HEADQUARTERS VANISHED.

565
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,375
- AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.

566
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,500
BECAUSE HEADQUARTERS

567
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,875
DISAPPEARED RIGHT AFTER

568
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,833
THAT LAST KAIN TRANSMISSION
OF YOURS,

569
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:08,208
I SUSPECT THERE'S SOME
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO.

570
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,375
- HMM.

571
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:14,166
ARE YOU ABLE TO ACCESS
YAGAMI'S COMPUTER DATABASE?

572
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,833
- OF COURSE I CAN.

573
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,166
I COULD GET THE ACCOUNT BOOKS

574
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,125
OF THE SCIENCE ACADEMY
IF I WANTED.

575
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,083
( typing )

576
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,666
- KAIN, KAIN?

577
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,125
I'M SURE I'VE SEEN THAT NAME
ON THE LIST

578
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:36,166
OF A-1 CLASS
CRIMINALS BEFORE.

579
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,625
( gasps )
- THERE IT IS.

580
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:44,875
LOOK AT THAT.
AGE, GENDER, HISTORY,

581
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,791
ORIGIN-- EVERYTHING
COMES UP UNKNOWN.

582
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,041
THERE ARE NO DISTINGUISHING
CHARACTERISTICS.

583
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,875
HOW CAN WE IDENTIFY HIM?

584
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,041
OFFENDER NUMBER 6-7,
CLASS A.

585
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:57,750
- "UNIVERSAL ERA 5-0-7-4-1-0.

586
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,708
CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY FORM

587
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,875
CLASSIFIED AS N.V.O.

588
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,291
CODE NAME: KAIN.

589
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,791
WANTED FOR
DESTRUCTION OF PLANETS,

590
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,708
SUSPICION OF MURDER.

591
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:09,333
GENERAL WARRANT ISSUED.

592
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:11,791
DESTROYED 13 FEDERATED PLANETS

593
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:17,041
AND 275,000 SPACECRAFT BEFORE
HE WAS APPREHENDED AND CONFINED

594
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,666
IN THE GALAXY POLICE
SUBSPACE NETWORK.

595
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,791
CONSIDERED
TO HAVE THE POWER

596
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:25,458
TO OVERCOME EVEN A LARGE
FORCE OF GALAXY POLICE. 

597
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:28,000
HAS BEEN CONFINED
IN THE HEADQUARTERS'

598
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:31,666
SUBSPACE ROOM
FOR THE PAST 100 YEARS."

599
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:36,000
- ( growls )

600
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,208
- HMM, NOT AN ORDINARY
CRIMINAL, IS HE?

601
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,875
HE'S MORE LIKE
A BRAND-NEW SUPERNOVA.

602
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,625
- BUT EVEN IF HE ESCAPED
THE SUBSPACE ROOM,

603
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,958
HOW COULD HE GO BACK
IN TIME 26 YEARS

604
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,625
AND INTERFERE WITH
THE EVENTS THERE? 

605
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,750
- HMM, TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

606
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,833
IF KAIN MANAGED TO
GET OUT OF SUBSPACE ,

607
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,708
THEN HE COULD EASILY
INFLUENCE THE PASSAGE OF TIME,

608
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:58,833
COULDN'T HE?

609
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:00,833
ANYWAY,
IF WE ASSUME

610
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:01,833
THAT KAIN
IS ON HIS WAY TO EARTH

611
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,375
AND FOR SOME REASON

612
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,208
INTENDS TO ATTACK ACHIKA,

613
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:07,541
I CAN NARROW
THE PROBABILITY LEVELS

614
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:11,000
TO 87% THAT WILL HAPPEN
BETWEEN NOVEMBER 25th

615
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,208
AND NOVEMBER 28th, 1970.

616
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,416
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS,
IT'LL BE SOMEWHERE IN--

617
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,875
OH MY GOD.

618
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:20,000
- Both: TOKYO.

619
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:25,250
- Tenchi: AND SO WE ALL
HEADED OFF TO TOKYO

620
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,666
FOR OUR SCHOOL TRIP.

621
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,625
- Ryoko: WELL, IF HE IS
GOING TO ATTACK US,

622
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,166
YOU'D THINK HE'D
HAVE THE DECENCY

623
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,333
NOT TO DO IT RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCHOOL TRIP.

624
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,791
- IT'S NOT 100% CERTAIN,

625
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,291
BUT THE PROBABILITY
IS MUCH HIGHER

626
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:37,875
ON THESE THREE DAYS.

627
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:39,375
- THIS KAIN IS STRONG ENOUGH

628
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:41,291
TO DESTROY
THE ENTIRE HEADQUARTERS?

629
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,833
( shrieks )

630
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:45,000
KIYONE, I WANT TO
GO BACK HOME NOW!

631
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,416
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T GO HOME.

632
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,208
WE HAVE TO STAY HERE
TO PROTECT MOTHER.

633
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:51,416
IT'S OUR MISSION.
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HER,

634
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,875
LORD TENCHI WILL DISAPPEAR
AND WE WILL TOO.

635
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,458
- HUSH, AYEKA.

636
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,541
- SO TELL ME,
WHEN DID ACHIKA

637
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:02,375
BECOME YOUR MOTHER?  HMM?
- ( growls )

638
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:05,416
- HEY, HEY, I KNOW
JUST WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

639
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,875
OH, ACHIKA, JUST
LIKE ONE OF THE FAMILY.

640
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:11,250
SEE?
OH-HO-HO-HO-HO.

641
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,250
- I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!

642
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:14,916
LOOK, YOU DIRT FOR BRAINS,
WE'VE ALL HEARD

643
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,458
ENOUGH OF YOUR INSINUATIONS!

644
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,666
- OH, YEAH, THE TRUTH HURTS,
DOESN'T IT?

645
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,958
YOU THINK I DIDN'T SEE
YOU AND ACHIKA YESTERDAY

646
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,750
BOTH SNEAKING OFF
TO TALK ABOUT THINGS

647
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:25,125
LIKE WHAT KIND OF BOYS
YOU BOTH PREFER?

648
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,375
- OH!  YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

649
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:28,708
( screams ) 
- I'M READY.

650
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:31,541
YOU WANT TO FIGHT?
- STOP IT NOW.

651
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,208
AYEKA, CALM DOWN.
- THIS TIME, SHE'S GONE TOO FAR.

652
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:34,375
I SWEAR IT!

653
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:35,875
- PLEASE!
- I'M GONNA TEACH HER A LESSON!

654
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,333
WATCH!
- HMPH, OH, YEAH, FOR SURE.

655
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:39,916
YOU AND WHAT ARMY, AYEKA?

656
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:46,291
- ( whimpers )
- Mihoshi: NO, STOP!

657
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,375
- Ayeka: ACHIKA WAS...
- ( static buzzes )

658
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,333
- Sasami: STOP IT!

659
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:07,375
- ( train whistles )
- ( wheels clacking  )

660
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:11,500
- Announcer:
TOKYO.  TOKYO.

661
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:12,916
WE APOLOGIZE
FOR THE LONG DELAY

662
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,458
IN REACHING
OUR DESTINATION.

663
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:17,375
THE A.M.F. WAS TURNED ON
AS A RESULT OF THIS DELAY.

664
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,583
WE OFFER OUR MOST
HUMBLE APOLOGIES...

665
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,375
- FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE--
- I FEEL SO TIRED.

666
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,083
- ME TOO, ACHIKA.
WELL, AT LEAST WE GOT HERE,

667
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,916
EVEN IF IT IS
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

668
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,666
- OKAY, SENIOR CLASS, 
NOW IS EVERYBODY HERE?

669
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,416
- YEAH.
- WE'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE.

670
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,000
- Male student: WE'RE HERE.
COME ON.  LET'S GO ALREADY.

671
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,000
- SO WHO'S GONNA
KEEP WATCH TONIGHT?

672
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,458
- SOMEHOW, I HAVE A FEELING
IT'S GOING TO BE US.

673
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,708
- ( yawns )
I FEEL SO SLEEPY.

674
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,625
- ( film clicking )
- HUH?

675
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,708
HEY, NOBOYUKI.
- ( laughs )

676
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:07,375
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

677
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:08,916
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT THING?

678
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,291
- ( laughs )
IT'LL BE A GREAT SOUVENIR.

679
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:14,166
- OH, DID YOU SLEEP
AT ALL LAST NIGHT? 

680
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,666
- A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.

681
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,375
- UGH!  IT'S STILL
TOO EARLY IN THE DAY

682
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:20,791
FOR ALL OF THIS.
- YES, I AGREE. 

683
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,166
THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING ALONG
JUST FINE, DON'T THEY?

684
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,458
ISN'T IT GREAT?
( yawns )

685
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:26,541
- HMPH!

686
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:30,750
- OH!  BOY, IT'S HOT.

687
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,625
I WISH THIS THING
WOULD GET GOING. 

688
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:35,708
- WISH I HAD SOME WATER!
- ( meows )

689
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,375
- ( Kiyone on Microphone ):
TESTING.  TESTING.

690
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,125
CHECK.

691
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,625
UH, GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.
HOW ARE YOU ALL TODAY?

692
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,541
I HOPE YOU ALL MANAGED TO GET
A RESTFUL SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

693
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,833
- ( groaning )
- NO!

694
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:48,833
- BE POLITE
CHILDREN NOW, PLEASE.

695
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:51,291
YOU LITTLE BRATS.

696
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,208
- ( film clicking )

697
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,500
- OH, DON'T!

698
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:28,125
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

699
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:30,083
- ( laughs )
JUST THINK OF IT

700
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,583
AS A WAY OF CAPTURING
GOOD MEMORIES.

701
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:33,041
INTERVIEW TIME.

702
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,000
ARE YOU ENJOYING OUR
CLASS TRIP, ACHIKA? 

703
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:37,375
- YEAH, I WOULD SAY I AM.

704
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:38,708
BUT, WELL,
THERE IS ONE THING

705
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:40,000
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT.

706
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,666
- WHAT?
- WELL, I AM WONDERING

707
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,833
IF MY FATHER HAS REMEMBERED
TO EAT PROPERLY.

708
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:46,125
- EAT PROPERLY?
DON'T WORRY.

709
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,666
PEOPLE DON'T
STARVE TO DEATH

710
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,250
JUST BECAUSE THEY SKIP MEALS
FOR THREE DAYS.

711
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,375
- YEAH, ARE YOU 
SURE ABOUT THAT?

712
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:54,250
- RELATIVELY.
- ( giggles )

713
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,208
- OKAY, ACHIKA, ARE YOU READY
FOR ANOTHER QUESTION?

714
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,125
- SURE THING.
THAT'S FINE. 

715
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,666
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

716
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,083
- ( gasps )

717
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,416
I WANT TO BE...

718
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,541
A BRIDE.

719
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:09,708
- ( boys laugh )
- Ryoko: AH, I BET YOU

720
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:10,958
WEREN'T READY FOR THAT ANSWER.

721
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:12,416
WERE YOU, NOBOYUKI?

722
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,333
- HEY, WHAT DO
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

723
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:16,416
WE WERE JUST TALKING.
IT'S NOTHING.

724
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,291
- WHOO WHOO!
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG

725
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:20,375
WITH THE TWO OF YOU
BEING ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER.

726
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,083
- WHAT?  STOP THAT.

727
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,666
NOBOYUKI, WHY DON'T
YOU SAY SOMETHING? 

728
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:29,208
- ( boys laugh )
- Ryoko: I KNEW IT.

729
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:31,791
LOOK AT NOBOYUKI BLUSH. 
HE KNOWS THAT IT'S TRUE.

730
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,833
- Ayeka: IT'S NOTHING.
HE'S A BIT SHY.

731
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:37,416
- WHAT ARE
THOSE IDIOTS DOING?

732
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,083
- YES, JUST WHEN YOUR
MOTHER AND FATHER

733
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,875
HAVE FINALLY GOTTEN TOGETHER.

734
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,041
I THINK THEY SHOULD JUST
LEAVE 'EM ALONE.

735
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,958
- ( meows ) 
- ( groans )

736
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,083
- ( gasps )
DISAPPEARING AGAIN?!

737
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:53,541
WHEW, JUST IN TIME.

738
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,041
- THANKS, SASAMI.

739
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:00,208
- I'M WORRIED, TENCHI.

740
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:03,625
I WONDER IF MISS WASHU'S SHIELD
IS LOSING STRENGTH.

741
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,916
- YEAH.

742
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,125
( sighs )

743
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,083
IF THIS KEEPS UP,

744
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:15,000
HOW AM I EVER GOING TO
LOOK AFTER MY MOTHER? 

745
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:18,500
- YOU'LL MANAGE, TENCHI.
- ( meows )

746
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:22,416
- SO THIS IS WHERE THE TWO OF
YOU HAVE BEEN HIDING YOURSELVES.

747
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
COME ON OUT.
NO ONE'S GONNA NOTICE

748
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,125
YOU'RE HERE WITH
ALL THESE STUDENTS AROUND.

749
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,791
- RYOKO.
- RYOKO, IT'S TERRIBLE.

750
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,041
TENCHI WAS ABOUT
TO DISAPPEAR AGAIN.

751
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,375
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

752
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
HUH?

753
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,541
THERE'S THAT GUY.

754
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,541
HE'S THE ONE!

755
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,541
HE'S BEEN SPYING ON US.

756
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,000
HEY, HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

757
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,541
HMM?

758
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,208
HE'S DISAPPEARED.

759
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:15,750
- ( crowds chatter )

760
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:20,791
- Man: KIDS,
OVER HERE WITH ME.

761
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:25,875
- PARDON ME, SIR.
I'LL HAVE ONE OF THESE

762
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:27,000
MILLET AND RICE CAKES, PLEASE.

763
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,458
- HEY, SOME OF THESE

764
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:30,541
SWEET BEAN PASTE CAKES.
- THIS LOVELY FAN

765
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:32,625
IS JUST WHAT
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

766
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,875
- ( chatter continues )

767
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:44,500
- ( both laughing )

768
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:46,250
- Noboyuki:
THIS ONE IS DELICIOUS.

769
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:47,458
( chuckles )
- ( Ryoko gasps )

770
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,083
- HUH?

771
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:57,791
- DID THAT GUY SAY
SOMETHING TO YOU? 

772
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,750
- NO, NOTHING. 
WHY DO YOU ASK?

773
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:02,750
- HERE, GOT TO GO.
- SHE'S SO WEIRD. 

774
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,041
I WONDER WHAT
THAT WAS ABOUT.

775
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:05,083
- YEAH.

776
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:27,250
- DAMN.  WHERE'D HE GO?

777
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,875
- DON'T MOVE.
- ( gasps )

778
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:43,958
- GET YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR HEAD, QUICK.

779
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,791
- STAY COOL. 
WHAT IS THIS?

780
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,750
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING
ACHIKA AROUND?

781
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:56,375
- THE SPACE PIRATE RYOKO,
I PRESUME.

782
00:46:56,458 --> 00:47:00,000
A SERIOUS OFFENDER.
CASE NUMBER: 8-0-8-1-2-0-2-9

783
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,333
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.
- ( gasps )

784
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:04,708
OH MY, THE GALAXY POLICE.

785
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,750
YOU WITH KIYONE AND MIHOSHI?

786
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:09,625
- HMPH!  YOU SEEM TO
BE GETTING ALONG WELL

787
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:12,583
WITH THOSE DETECTIVES
FIRST CLASS.

788
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,708
- ME, I'M A SPECIAL OPERATIVE.

789
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:18,041
I'M WITH THE GALAXY POLICE
DEALING WITH SERIOUS CRIMINALS.

790
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:20,291
THE ENERGY OF
THE CLASS-A CRIMINAL KAIN

791
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:22,250
HAS DRAWN ME BACK HERE
TO THIS ERA.

792
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,000
- ( screams )

793
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:28,375
- KAIN... AND JUST
WHO IS THIS GUY, ANYWAY?

794
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:30,708
AND WHAT DOES HE HAVE
TO DO WITH ACHIKA?

795
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:33,791
- KAIN'S A BEING
WHO HATES THE HOUSE OF JURAI.

796
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:37,875
100 YEARS AGO,
HE WENT ON A RAMPAGE

797
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:41,625
OF MURDER AND DESTRUCTION
ACROSS THE UNIVERSE.

798
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:43,750
- ( deep chuckle )

799
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,916
- THE HOUSE OF JURAI COOPERATED
WITH THE GALAXY POLICE

800
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,500
IN CAPTURING HIM.

801
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:50,750
- ( screams )

802
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:56,708
- THEN A WEEK AGO,

803
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,041
HE DESTROYED OUR HEADQUARTERS
AND VANISHED.

804
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:02,375
HE HAS COME
TO THIS WORLD AND TIME

805
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:06,125
TO TAKE REVENGE
BY SWALLOWING UP THE JURAI.

806
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:08,250
- WHAT'S THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ACHIKA?

807
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:09,416
- A LOT.

808
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,791
THE CURRENT JURAI EMPEROR

809
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,083
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIS CAPTIVITY,

810
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:13,708
BUT KAIN STILL HATES HIM.

811
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:17,625
KAIN THRIVES WHERE
THERE IS NO JURAI ENERGY.

812
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:19,458
SO HE'S HERE TO MAKE SURE
THAT NO ONE

813
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:22,041
WHO CONTROLS THAT POWER
CAN STAND IN HIS WAY.

814
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,541
AND SINCE YOSHO
AND LADY ACHIKA

815
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:27,541
ARE FROM
THE HOUSE OF JURAI...

816
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,625
- SO SHE'S NOTHING MORE
THAN AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

817
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:32,916
- ( grunts )

818
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,875
( grunts )
- ( grunts )

819
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:39,958
TAKE THIS!

820
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,375
BASTARD.

821
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,958
- ( laughs )

822
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:51,708
YOU'RE VERY GOOD, RYOKO.

823
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,666
I DON'T KNOW WHY ALL OF YOU
HAVE COME TO THIS ERA,

824
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,333
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

825
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:59,875
KAIN WILL BE MINE!

826
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:01,125
- ( gasps )

827
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,291
- ( chuckles )

828
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,958
- WAIT.

829
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:09,125
- I'LL LET YOU
RUN FREE, RYOKO,

830
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:11,458
UNTIL I DEFEAT KAIN!

831
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:13,833
- ( gasps )

832
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,333
WHAT NEXT?

833
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:20,041
- Tenchi: AND WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU GET IN THE WAY

834
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,375
OF THEM COMING TOGETHER?

835
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,625
IF MY MOTHER AND FATHER
DON'T MARRY,

836
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:25,333
I DON'T GET BORN.

837
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:28,416
SO DO ME A FAVOR, YOU TWO,
AND STOP MEDDLING WITH THEM,

838
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,291
WILL YOU?!

839
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:32,166
- I'M SORRY.

840
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,750
- WE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY IT.
HONEST, WE DIDN'T, TENCHI.

841
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:39,666
ANYWAY, I THINK I KNOW
WHAT KAIN IS AFTER.

842
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,875
- RYOKO, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- HUH?

843
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:43,833
- KIYONE, YOU WANT TO GO OUT?

844
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:47,375
THERE'S A SOUVENIR SHOP
ON THE FIRST FLOOR, YOU KNOW.

845
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:50,041
( gasps )
ARE ALL OF YOU COMING?

846
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,875
- ( all groan )

847
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,833
- OH NO!  MIHOSHI,
WHERE'S ACHIKA?

848
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:56,916
- All: HUH?
- WELL, LET'S SEE.

849
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,833
I KNOW WE WERE TOGETHER
AS FAR AS THE BATH.

850
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:02,125
- OH NO.
- EVERYBODY, JUST CALM DOWN.

851
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:06,750
AND I'LL GO FIND HER.
- SORRY.

852
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:09,208
- Ryoko: YOU ARE PROVING USELESS
TO THIS OPERATION.

853
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:13,416
- Mihoshi: I JUST CAN'T DO
ANYTHING RIGHT WITHOUT KIYONE.

854
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,500
- Sasami: SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WHERE IS KIYONE?

855
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:18,541
- Tenchi: GEE, I DON'T KNOW.

856
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,750
I'M SURE I GAVE HER
THE RIGHT ROOM NUMBER.

857
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,333
- ( chews nosily )

858
00:50:22,416 --> 00:50:23,833
- ( Mihoshi cries )

859
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:26,875
KIYONE!  WHERE IS KIYONE?

860
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:28,375
( cries )

861
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,791
- ( yowls )

862
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,750
- KIYONE!

863
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:34,666
( cries )

864
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,416
DON'T LEAVE ME, KIYONE.

865
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,583
- ( Kiyone screams )
- Tenchi: WHOA!

866
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:52,250
- WHAT WAS THAT?
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

867
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,958
- ( groaning )

868
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:57,750
- Tenchi: THERE YOU ARE, KIYONE.
- Ryoko: WOW, WHAT HAPPENED?

869
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:00,041
- I WISH WASHU WOULD FIND
A BETTER LANDING PLACE

870
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:02,375
FOR HER DAMN
TIME TRANSFERS.

871
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,750
- WASHU.

872
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:06,375
- OH, SHE'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS THEN?

873
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:10,875
- UH-HUH. SHE'LL EXPLAIN
IT ALL IN DETAIL HERSELF.

874
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:16,708
- HI, SO HOW'S EVERYONE DOING?

875
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:19,416
- MISS WASHU!
- EVERYTHING GOING OKAY?

876
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,333
- WELL, IT'S NOT BAD SO FAR.

877
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:23,541
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THIS GUY KAIN?

878
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,375
- GOOD QUESTION.
WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY KAIN?

879
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,458
I'M SURE THE ANTI-JURAI ATTACK
ON LADY ACHIKA

880
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:30,958
WILL COME TOMORROW,
BUT I CAN'T BE SURE WHERE.

881
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:33,583
THERE IS ONE PLACE THAT
WE SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR THOUGH.

882
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:36,458
SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE'S
A VERY BIG TRANSMITTER.

883
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:39,375
- A TRANSMITTER?!
- HMM?

884
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,000
- TOKYO TOWER!

885
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,208
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE
ALL HEADING TOMORROW.

886
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:45,208
- OH, BUT NOW
I WON'T BE ABLE

887
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:46,583
TO TAKE THE PICTURE
I WANTED

888
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,000
FROM THEIR COOL
OBSERVATION DECK.

889
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:50,291
- PLEASE SHUT UP!
- WHAA!

890
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,708
- Washu: LISTEN UP.
I HAVE THE DATA

891
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:55,458
FROM WHEN KAIN WAS TAKEN
PRISONER 100 YEARS AGO.

892
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,333
HE WAS CAPTURED
THROUGH A COMBINATION

893
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:59,291
OF THE SUBSPACE NET
AND THE ENERGY

894
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:01,833
FROM THE EMPEROR JURAI.

895
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:03,833
- ( screaming )

896
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:08,250
- Washu:
BUT IN THIS GENERATION,

897
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,625
I'M AFRAID THERE IS NO ONE
CAPABLE OF WIELDING

898
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:13,000
THAT AMOUNT OF ENERGY.

899
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,000
MAYBE GRANDPA COULD DO IT.

900
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:16,666
- THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY
THAT'S REQUIRED

901
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,791
CANNOT BE GENERATED
BY LORD KATSUHITO. 

902
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:21,500
AND IT WOULD BE TOO DANGEROUS
FOR HIM TO EVEN TRY.

903
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,500
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

904
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:25,750
- THAT THE JURAI EMPEROR DIED.

905
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,875
HE WAS ABLE TO HELP
IN THE CAPTURE OF KAIN,

906
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,041
BUT DISPELLING
THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY NECESSARY

907
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:31,833
PROVED TO BE FATAL.

908
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,291
IT JUST WON'T WORK.

909
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,166
OKAY, LISTEN UP, TROOPS.
I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.

910
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,708
I'VE TAKEN ALL OF THIS
INTO ACCOUNT.

911
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,583
I'M SENDING YOU SOME
IMPORTANT EQUIPMENT.

912
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:45,291
MY CYE-LINK ANALYZER
IS DESIGNED

913
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:47,500
TO AMPLIFY THE CYE-WAVE
ACTIVITY OF TREES

914
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,625
AND CONNECTS IT DIRECTLY
TO THE SUBSPACE NET.

915
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,333
- FASCINATING, BUT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

916
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:53,416
HOW ANY OF THIS STUFF
IS SUPPOSED TO HELP US OUT.

917
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,791
- HEH!  IT'S ELEMENTARY.

918
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:56,416
MY EQUIPMENT WAS
MADE TO COMBINE 

919
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,333
THE JURAI ENERGY WITH
THE SUBSPACE NET.

920
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:00,666
KIYONE, SHOW THEM!
- OKAY.

921
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:08,583
THIS IS THE MAIN BOOSTER.

922
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:11,416
NOW LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.

923
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,000
WE PLACE THIS
ON THE TOKYO TOWER.

924
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,416
THE OTHERS GO ELSEWHERE.

925
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,416
THEY'RE ACTIVATED
BY REMOTE SWITCH.

926
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,583
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO GIVE US
TEN MINUTES OF POWER.

927
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,875
- ONLY TEN?
THAT'S NOT MUCH TIME, IS IT?

928
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:23,833
- LOOK, RYOKO,
THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT.

929
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,416
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

930
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,041
THIS IS AN INSTANT
JURAI ENERGY GENERATOR.

931
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,916
BE HAPPY THAT IT
WORKS AT ALL.

932
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,333
- IS IT POSSIBLE
WE CAN GENERATE 

933
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,666
JURAI ENERGY RIGHT HERE?
ON EARTH, THAT IS.

934
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,333
- WELL, IT WON'T WORK
JUST ANYWHERE.

935
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:37,833
ONLY FROM THE FIVE PLACES
ON THE MAP

936
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,583
THAT I GAVE TO KIYONE--

937
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,750
NOWHERE ELSE
ON THE EARTH BUT THERE.

938
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:43,666
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
IN A WAY, WE'RE LUCKY

939
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,208
THAT THE ATTACK IS GOING
TO HAPPEN HERE IN TOKYO.

940
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:49,083
- MEGURO, THE BLACK EYE.

941
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:51,750
MEJIRO, THE WHITE EYE.

942
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:54,166
OH, WOW, THESE ARE
THE FIVE COLOR FUDO TEMPLES.

943
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,375
- Sasami: THE FIVE COLOR FUDO?
- HM-HMM.

944
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:59,000
IN FEUDAL TIMES,
THEY PUT UP THESE STATUES

945
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:01,625
OF FUDO MYO-O
TO GUARD EDO CASTLE HERE.

946
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:03,333
THIS MUST BE IT.

947
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:06,833
THE OTHERS ARE THE RED EYE,
BLUE EYE, AND YELLOW EYE.

948
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,375
- GOOD THINKING!

949
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,000
THE ONLY WAY
FOR US TO ACCESS

950
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,041
SUCH LARGE AMOUNTS
OF ENERGY QUICKLY 

951
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:13,916
IS TO USE
THE ANCIENT HOLY PLACES

952
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,708
AND UTILIZE THEIR ENERGY.

953
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,416
- SO, NOW, WE HAVE
TO DECIDE

954
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,125
WHO'S GONNA
TARGET EACH TEMPLE

955
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:21,416
AND WHO'S GONNA KEEP AN EYE
ON LADY ACHIKA.

956
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:25,416
- YOU CAN DECIDE ON THE REST.
I'LL WATCH MOTHER.

957
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,041
- IS THAT WISE?

958
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:32,375
- Tenchi: I DON'T KNOW,

959
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:34,875
BUT I KNOW IT HAS
TO BE THIS WAY.

960
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,750
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT
YOU'VE ALL BEEN CAUGHT UP

961
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:39,666
IN MY FAMILY'S PROBLEMS.

962
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,333
BUT NOW I HAVE
TO BE THE ONE.

963
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:45,000
WHEN THE FINAL BATTLE COMES,

964
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:46,791
I HAVE TO STAND BESIDE HER.

965
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,041
- WHY DON'T YOU
GO AHEAD THEN, TENCHI.

966
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,666
WE CAN HANDLE THE REST
OF THE DETAILS OURSELVES.

967
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,541
- THANK YOU, RYOKO.

968
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:04,250
( screams )

969
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:07,375
( groans )

970
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:09,958
- Kiyone: TENCHI!
- Sasami: TENCHI!

971
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,500
- Mihoshi: ARE YOU OKAY?

972
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:14,125
- Ryoko: GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF.
- Sasami: TENCHI!

973
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:17,916
- ( grunts, growls )

974
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,125
- ( moans )

975
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:21,625
- ACHIKA, ARE YOU OKAY?

976
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,208
WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED
TO YOU?

977
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:26,958
- IT'S MY HEAD.
THERE'S SUCH SPLITTING PAIN!

978
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:29,000
- ACHIKA, WHAT IS IT?
- DON'T KNOW.

979
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:31,041
SHE GRABBED HER HEAD
AND SHE FELL OVER.

980
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:32,875
- THE POOR THING.
- ( whimpers )

981
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:34,916
- LET'S TAKE HER BACK
TO HER ROOM.

982
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,708
- ( moans )
- OKAY.

983
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:40,375
- ( grunting )

984
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:41,583
AHH!

985
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:46,166
- I GOT THE SHIELD.

986
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,083
- ( strained )
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

987
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,708
( growls )

988
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:58,500
( sighs )

989
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,208
( gasps )

990
00:56:08,291 --> 00:56:11,041
( light panting )

991
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,333
- TENCHI.

992
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:15,291
- I'M GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

993
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,708
I MUST BE ABLE
TO BEAR THIS MUCH PAIN

994
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,208
OR HOW CAN I PROTECT
MOTHER FROM DANGER? 

995
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:25,416
- HMM, WELL THEN, YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

996
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,833
YOU BETTER GET READY.

997
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,166
- WASHU, HOW CAN
YOU BE SO DAMN CALM?

998
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,916
WHY DON'T YOU DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?

999
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
- WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

1000
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:35,416
LADY ACHIKA'S COLLAPSED,
I HATE TO SAY.

1001
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,625
- ( all gasping )
- OH, I HOPE SHE'S NOT HURT.

1002
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,625
- YOU CARRIED ME.

1003
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:50,916
- IT WAS NOTHING.

1004
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,375
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

1005
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:54,958
- ( sighs )
I FEEL MUCH BETTER.

1006
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:56,583
- THAT'S GOOD.

1007
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:59,333
- I'M SO SORRY
TO HAVE WORRIED YOU.

1008
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,000
- I'LL STAY TILL
YOU FALL ASLEEP.

1009
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:03,625
- HEY, AYEKA.

1010
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,375
HOW IS ACHIKA DOING?

1011
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:09,625
- THEY SAY IT'S NOTHING MORE
THAN ANEMIA.

1012
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:12,333
- I WONDER IF KAIN
IS CAUSING ALL OF THIS.

1013
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:15,500
- IT'S A REASONABLE
EXPLANATION.

1014
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:18,083
WASHU DID SAY THERE'S
NO LONGER ANY DOUBT

1015
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:20,750
THAT KAIN WILL MATERIALIZE
SOMETIME TOMORROW.

1016
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:23,583
SO ACHIKA SHOULD BE OKAY
UNTIL THEN.

1017
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:26,125
WE SHOULD USE THIS TIME
TO PLAN THE DEPLOYMENT 

1018
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:28,708
OF OUR EQUIPMENT
SO WE CAN DEFEAT HIM.

1019
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:31,125
- MM-HMM.
- RIGHT!  

1020
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,875
- TENCHI, I KNOW YOU WANT 
TO STAY CLOSE TO YOUR MOM,

1021
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:36,250
SO YOU'LL GO TO
THE TOKYO TOWER WITH ACHIKA

1022
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:38,291
AND TAKE
THE MAIN BOOSTER, OKAY?

1023
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,458
- YES.

1024
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,166
BY NEXT MORNING,
OUR PLANS HAD BEEN LAID.

1025
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,333
KAIN WOULD APPEAR SOON,

1026
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:48,291
MAKING IT A DAY
WE WOULD NEVER FORGET.

1027
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,416
WELL, THIS IS IT.
I GUESS I'LL BE ON MY WAY

1028
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,833
TO THE TOKYO TOWER.

1029
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,583
- ALL RIGHT,
PLEASE REMEMBER

1030
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:57,375
THE MAIN BOOSTER
HAS TO BE SET

1031
00:57:57,458 --> 00:58:00,375
SOMEWHERE IN THE CENTER
OF THE TOWER'S OBSERVATION DECK.

1032
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:02,125
- GOT IT.
- AS SOON AS I'VE GOT

1033
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:04,000
MY STUFF IN POSITION,
I'LL HEAD OVER THERE.

1034
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:06,625
IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS
AT ALL, USE THE TRANSCEIVER.

1035
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,041
- RIGHT.

1036
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:11,708
SEE YOU ALL LATER. 
- ...LORD TENCHI.

1037
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:14,416
- DAMN.

1038
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,250
IF ONLY THIS WAS ALL
HAPPENING AT A LOCATION

1039
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:17,625
THAT I'D ALREADY BEEN TO.

1040
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,000
THEN I COULD
TELEPORT OVER THERE

1041
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,250
AND SET THE WHOLE THING UP.

1042
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:22,166
- ( laughs )
PERFECT.

1043
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,250
JUST ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR POWERS
THAT ISN'T ANY USE.

1044
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:25,541
- WHAT WAS THAT
YOU SAID, AYEKA?!

1045
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:26,875
- THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU TWO.

1046
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:28,333
STOP WASTING TIME.

1047
00:58:28,416 --> 00:58:30,666
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- LET'S GO.

1048
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,208
- Sasami: OKAY.
- ( meows )

1049
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:33,833
- Ryoko: WE SHOULD TAKE
THE YAMANOTE LINE, RIGHT?

1050
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:35,458
- Ayeka: I'M TAKING
THE ONE BOUND FOR SHIBUYA.

1051
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:38,041
- ARE WE GOING THE
SAME WAY, SASAMI?

1052
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:40,416
- YUP. BUT I HAVE TO
SWITCH TRAINS LATER.

1053
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,916
- Kiyone: WHERE IS SHE NOW?

1054
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:46,500
MIHOSHI?!  MIHOSHI!

1055
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,958
COME ON, MIHOSHI!

1056
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,833
- ( slurps )

1057
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,416
( sighs )

1058
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,000
THAT WAS GOOD.

1059
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:12,583
- HEY.
( laughs )

1060
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:15,000
SO THIS IS TOKYO TOWER.

1061
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:41,791
( giggles )
THIS IS GREAT.

1062
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:42,750
- YEAH.

1063
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:47,291
- ( pants )

1064
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,125
GREAT.

1065
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:51,500
( pants )

1066
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:55,666
LOOKS LIKE
I MADE IT ON TIME.

1067
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:20,916
- THERE, ONE DOWN.

1068
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,166
NOW, WE'VE GOT TO GET
OVER TO THE RED FUDO.

1069
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:31,416
- EXCUSE ME.
I'M COMING IN.

1070
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,458
- MAY YOU GUARD
TENCHI WELL.

1071
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:52,333
- Women: TOKYO TOWER.

1072
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,125
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
- TAKE A PICTURE OF ME.

1073
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,333
- ( chatter continues )

1074
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:07,625
- RIGHT THERE.

1075
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:09,625
WHOA!
( screams )

1076
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:14,041
- ( pants )

1077
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,958
- ( meows )
- GENERATOR IN PLACE.

1078
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:29,208
RED FUDO!
- ( meows )

1079
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:36,416
- ( phone rings )

1080
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,083
- YES?
- Kiyone: TENCHI.

1081
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:40,500
ALL OF THE GENERATORS
ARE IN PLACE ON THE FIVE FUDO.

1082
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,666
HOW'S THE MAIN 
BOOSTER COMING?

1083
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,000
- NOT TOO GOOD.

1084
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:45,583
I'M CAUGHT UP IN
A CROWD OF STUDENTS.

1085
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:47,416
- Kiyone: OKAY,
DON'T SWITCH IT ON

1086
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,000
UNTIL YOU'VE PUT IT IN PLACE
ON THE OBSERVATION DECK.

1087
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:52,125
IF YOU DO IT BEFORE THAT,
IT'LL START TO DISCHARGE.

1088
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,958
SO BE CAREFUL!
- RIGHT.

1089
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:56,250
I UNDERSTAND.

1090
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:05,625
- IT WON'T BE LONG.

1091
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:07,333
- ( elevator pings )

1092
01:02:07,416 --> 01:02:08,583
- ( Woman over P.A. ):
THANK YOU FOR WAITING.

1093
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:10,625
PLEASE WATCH YOUR STEP.
- ( chattering )

1094
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:14,625
- ( elevator dings )
- EXCUSE ME!  PARDON ME!

1095
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:16,500
- HEY, MAN!
- OH!

1096
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:18,375
- ( Woman on P.A. ): THANK YOU
FOR VISITING TOKYO TOWER.

1097
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:21,291
IN HEIGHT: 333 METERS AND...
- WOW.

1098
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:26,000
- ( grunts )
- OH!

1099
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:27,916
- ACHIKA, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

1100
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,041
( groans )

1101
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:33,250
- HUH?  EXCUSE ME.  PARDON ME.
- ( whimpering )

1102
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,375
- SORRY.

1103
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:36,916
- ( thunder crashes )

1104
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:49,833
- OH, IT'S SHAKING.

1105
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:51,333
- SOMEONE!
- WHAT IS THIS?

1106
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:52,458
- ( all whimpering )

1107
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:53,666
- ( grunting ) 
- HUSH, ACHIKA,

1108
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,083
ARE YOU FEELING SICK?

1109
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:57,541
- ( Woman on P.A. ):
PLEASE REMAIN CALM. 

1110
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,541
THE ELEVATOR WILL
RESUME ASCENT SHORTLY.

1111
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:02,333
NOW PLEASE CALM DOWN.

1112
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:03,458
- IT'S KAIN.

1113
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:25,041
- ( rumbling )

1114
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:35,916
- ( coughing )

1115
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,583
- Kain: I CAN FEEL IT.

1116
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:41,458
IT'S SO CLOSE.

1117
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:44,250
THE BLOOD OF JURAI.

1118
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,041
( chuckles )

1119
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:01,583
( cackles )

1120
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:04,208
( groans )

1121
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,375
PATHETIC.

1122
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,625
- OH.
- ( gasps )

1123
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:20,000
- QUICK-- LET'S GET
TO THE STAIRS

1124
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:22,666
BEFORE HE COMES BACK.
- GOOD IDEA.

1125
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,458
- WHERE'D HE GO?!

1126
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:27,750
( grunts )

1127
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:29,000
( growls )

1128
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:33,916
( screams )

1129
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:39,125
- A SURVIVOR FROM
THE GALAXY POLICE, HMM?

1130
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,500
WHAT MAGNIFICENT
SPIRIT YOU'VE SHOWN

1131
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:43,625
IN TRACKING ME
ALL THE WAY HERE.

1132
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:45,458
- KAIN, I'M GONNA GET YOU

1133
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,708
IF IT'S THE LAST THING
I EVER DO.

1134
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,000
- ( pants )

1135
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:01,708
- HOW PITIFUL
THAT YOUR SKILL

1136
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:04,250
AS AN OPERATIVE HAS HELPED
SEAL YOUR FATE.

1137
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,541
NO ONE CAN WITHSTAND
THE POWER OF KAIN.

1138
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:10,125
- ( groans )

1139
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:13,958
( screams )

1140
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:15,833
- ( chuckling )
- ( screaming continues )

1141
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:19,875
- Washu: TENCHI, ANSWER ME.

1142
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,791
NO, NOT GOOD.

1143
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:23,250
CAN'T KEEP UP THE POWER.

1144
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,375
THE FIVE FUDO
ARE GOING TO FAIL.

1145
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,333
- COME ON, TENCHI.

1146
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:31,583
- TENCHI.

1147
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:39,791
- ( both panting )

1148
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:45,708
- ( pants )

1149
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:49,750
WHAT THE--

1150
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:52,833
- I MUST FIND THE CENTER.

1151
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,166
- ACHIKA?
- HUH?

1152
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,625
- ( energy building )
- HE'S COMING.

1153
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,458
- ( crashing, rumbling )

1154
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:10,208
- ( both coughing )
- ACHIKA.

1155
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:15,458
- ( both scream )

1156
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:21,666
- ( chuckling )

1157
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,250
I FEEL IT.

1158
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:26,875
SOMEONE FROM
THE HOUSE OF JURAI

1159
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:28,333
IS HERE.

1160
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:30,750
WHICH ONE OF YOU 
HOLDS THAT POWER?

1161
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:34,041
- PUT THIS SOMEWHERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DECK

1162
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:35,208
AND HURRY!
- WHAT?

1163
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,958
- GO DO IT.

1164
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:41,125
- BUT WHAT DOES-- HUH?

1165
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:48,083
- THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANY FARTHER.

1166
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:52,125
- ARE YOU OF
THE HOUSE OF JURAI?

1167
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,458
( chuckles )
VERY INTERESTING.

1168
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:57,000
WE'LL SEE HOW MUCH POWER
YOU HAVE!

1169
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,000
( grunts )

1170
01:06:58,083 --> 01:07:00,250
- ( straining )

1171
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:04,000
- ( chuckling )

1172
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:06,250
- QUICK,
ACHIKA, LET'S GO.

1173
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:07,916
- WHO'S THAT BOY?

1174
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,416
- ACHIKA, WE GOT TO GO!

1175
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,500
- TENCHI, I'M ALMOST THERE.

1176
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:21,875
- HE SAID TO PUT IT
IN THE MIDDLE.

1177
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:24,000
- ( groaning )
- HUH?

1178
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,708
- ( pants )

1179
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:32,583
- ( chuckles )

1180
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:36,166
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE END
OF THE HOUSE OF JURAI.

1181
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:40,208
I'LL ERADICATE YOU
AND PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY.

1182
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:42,333
( chuckles )

1183
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:46,958
- I WON'T LET YOU
TOUCH MY MOM!

1184
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:47,958
- HUH?

1185
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:56,916
ENOUGH!
THIS WILL STOP.

1186
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:01,583
- WHAT?

1187
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:02,791
- ACHIKA?

1188
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:09,041
- YOU ARE THE ONE
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

1189
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:11,416
YOU AND NO ONE ELSE.

1190
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,791
NONE OF THE OTHERS
WERE THE SAME.

1191
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:16,333
I'VE COME ALL THE WAY
TO THIS PLANET

1192
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:20,250
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
TO DESTROY YOU.

1193
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:22,666
- TELL ME WHO YOU ARE.

1194
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,541
- I AM ONE WHO HAS 
SUFFERED GRIEVOUSLY

1195
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,666
FROM THE POWER THAT LIES
LATENT WITHIN YOU.

1196
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,791
- ( pants )

1197
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:31,250
PUSH THE RED BUTTON!

1198
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:32,666
THEN GET HER
OUT OF HERE FAST.

1199
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:33,958
- HUH?  HUH.

1200
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,750
HUH?  COME ON.

1201
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:48,375
- WHAT?  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

1202
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,958
- ( Ryoko screams )

1203
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:20,125
- ( groaning )

1204
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:21,666
- ( grunting )

1205
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,791
- ( screams )

1206
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,750
- ACHIKA!

1207
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,125
- ( strains )

1208
01:09:34,583 --> 01:09:36,083
- I CAN'T HOLD ON!

1209
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:40,500
- IF I HAVE TO GO,
I WON'T GO ALONE. 

1210
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:43,000
- Achika: PLEASE NO!  
- I'M LOSING MY GRIP.

1211
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:49,583
- HANG ON, DAD!

1212
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:52,291
HOLD ON TO HER!
DON'T LET HER GO!

1213
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:58,833
- ( screams )

1214
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:05,166
- ( all scream )

1215
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:10,000
- FATHER!

1216
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:11,333
MOTHER!

1217
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,333
RYOKO!

1218
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,083
STOP IT.

1219
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:15,916
RYOKO, LET GO!
- TENCHI!

1220
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,166
- I'VE GOT TO HELP THEM.
- TENCHI.

1221
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:19,958
IT'S TOO LATE.

1222
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,791
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN
PULLED IN.

1223
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:24,125
- LET ME GO TO THEM.

1224
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:25,375
THEY NEED MY HELP!

1225
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:28,083
MOTHER!

1226
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:32,500
- ( wind rushes )

1227
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,000
- HOW AWFUL,

1228
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:04,541
AFTER WASHU'S EQUIPMENT
WORKED SO WELL.

1229
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:09,208
- Washu: I NEVER IMAGINED
THAT WHEN WE SENT KAIN

1230
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:11,250
INTO ANOTHER
SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM,

1231
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,125
HE'D PULL LADY ACHIKA
IN WITH HIM.

1232
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,958
- WASHU, ISN'T THERE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO 

1233
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:26,833
TO BRING MY MOTHER
AND FATHER BACK?

1234
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:28,916
TELL ME, PLEASE.

1235
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,750
- Washu:
I'M AFRAID NOT, TENCHI.

1236
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,500
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
TO DETERMINE

1237
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,750
THE EXACT COORDINATES
INSIDE SUBSPACE .

1238
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:39,458
SO WE HAVE NO ACCESS.

1239
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:42,291
- NO ACCESS?

1240
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:47,500
WASHU!

1241
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,291
PLEASE TRY TO
BRING THEM BACK.

1242
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:54,250
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

1243
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:57,750
PLEASE, WASHU, 
OR THEY'LL DIE.

1244
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:01,583
- ( wind rushes )

1245
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:21,875
- ( gasps )

1246
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:27,291
ACHIKA!

1247
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:32,708
- Washu: WELL,
IT'S A LONG SHOT,

1248
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,750
BUT WE CAN TRY TO TRANSFER

1249
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,791
ACHIKA'S BRAIN WAVES
INTO TENCHI.

1250
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:39,666
THEN RYOKO CAN TELEPORT
TO THOSE COORDINATES. 

1251
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,083
AND YOU CAN FOLLOW.

1252
01:12:41,166 --> 01:12:43,000
- Ayeka: WELL, WHAT
ARE WE WAITING FOR?

1253
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:45,208
- Washu: YOU'RE FORGETTING
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. 

1254
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:47,166
EVEN IF THIS DOES WORK,

1255
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,625
YOU'LL STILL HAVE TO FACE KAIN
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

1256
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:52,833
AND HE'S MORE POWERFUL
THAN ALL OF YOU COMBINED.

1257
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:54,375
- ( screams )

1258
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:01,875
- Ryoko: WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO DO THEN?

1259
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:04,041
- ( rumbling )

1260
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:15,250
- IT'S RISKY, BUT I'LL USE
THE DIMENSIONAL CANNON.

1261
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:18,000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE DIMENSIONAL CANNON?

1262
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:20,875
NOW, WAIT JUST A MINUTE,
MISS WASHU!

1263
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,333
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
USE THAT CANNON

1264
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:23,375
TO BLOW UP A WHOLE PLANET.

1265
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:25,416
IT'S FOR TAKING OUT
A SMALL GALAXY.

1266
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,000
- WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
WHO OUR OPPONENT IS. 

1267
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:30,208
IF WE DON'T DESTROY HIM
RIGHT NOW,

1268
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:32,375
THERE'S NO TELLING WHEN
HE'LL FIND HIS WAY OUT OF

1269
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:35,541
ALTERNATE SPACE-TIME AGAIN.
HEH-HEH.

1270
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:38,125
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE GONNA USE

1271
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:40,458
AS POWERFUL
A WEAPON AS THAT.

1272
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:54,125
- ( chuckling )

1273
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,916
- Ayeka: CAN YOU PLEASE
SLOW DOWN, RYOKO?!

1274
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,583
- OH, BE QUIET.  NORMALLY,
WE WOULDN'T EVEN NEED YOUR HELP.

1275
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:00,583
TENCHI AND I COULD HANDLE
THIS ALONE, YOU KNOW.

1276
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:03,958
- ALL YOU HAVE IS COMPLETELY
USELESS DESTRUCTIVE POWER.

1277
01:14:04,041 --> 01:14:05,875
- OH, WHAT A JOKE!

1278
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:08,500
IF NOBOYUKI HADN'T BEEN
SUCKED INTO SUBSPACE , 

1279
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:10,875
THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE
NEEDED YOU AROUND ANYWAY.

1280
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:13,125
- HELLO, MY LORD TENCHI,
IT'S SO WONDERFUL

1281
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:15,458
TO SEE THAT YOU'RE HERE SAFE.
- MISS AYEKA,

1282
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:17,875
I'M VERY SORRY.
- DON'T BE.

1283
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:20,333
WHY, TO SAVE YOUR MOTHER,
I'D WALK THROUGH FIRE.

1284
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:22,291
I'D SWIM THE DEEPEST OCEANS.
- ( nervous laugh )

1285
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,041
- WHAT A BUNCH OF RUBBISH.

1286
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,166
HEY, WASHU, WE'RE 
READY TO TRANSFER.

1287
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,166
- Washu: ROGER.

1288
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:53,250
- IT'S HERE.

1289
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:23,291
DIMENSIONAL CANNON IS
ARMED, AIMED, AND READY.

1290
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:26,625
- OKAY, WE'RE ALL YOURS.

1291
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:28,625
SO GO AHEAD, WASHU,
TAKE CONTROL.

1292
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:31,291
- ROGER AND OUT.
RYOKO, GET SET. 

1293
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:33,291
IT'S UP TO YOU TO TELEPORT
TO THE PLACE

1294
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,083
THAT TENCHI IMAGES 
AFTER THE TRANSFER.

1295
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:36,250
GOT IT?

1296
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:39,375
- NO PROBLEM, WASHU.
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

1297
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:41,333
- THE POWER OF
THE SHIELD IS ONLY GOOD

1298
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:42,791
FOR THREE MORE MINUTES.

1299
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:44,708
BE SURE YOU GET EVERYTHING DONE
THAT YOU HAVE TO

1300
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:46,041
WITHIN THAT TIME, OKAY?

1301
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,791
- YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

1302
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:53,208
- ( beeping )

1303
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:56,583
- ( thunder crashing )
- ( static buzzes )

1304
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,708
- ( gasps )
- ( groans )

1305
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:09,291
- NOBOYUKI!

1306
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:11,875
- ( chuckles )

1307
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:14,041
- NOBOYUKI!

1308
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:16,500
- ( echoes )
REMEMBER, YOU PROMISED

1309
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:19,208
YOU'LL COME AND SEE ME
IN THE HOUSE I BUILD.

1310
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:21,000
WON'T YOU, ACHIKA?

1311
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,458
- ( grunts )
- NOBOYUKI!  

1312
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,458
- ( coughs )

1313
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:35,208
- ( strains, grunts )

1314
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:42,291
NOBOYUKI!

1315
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,125
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1316
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:47,333
- ( coughs )

1317
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:51,416
- YOU AND I
WILL BUILD...

1318
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,083
THAT BEAUTIFUL HOUSE
TOGETHER, RIGHT?

1319
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:58,500
- OH, NOBOYUKI,
I KNOW WE WILL.

1320
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:01,250
- ( moans )

1321
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:04,250
- IT'LL BE OKAY.

1322
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,500
THIS NIGHTMARE
WILL BE OVER SOON.

1323
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,791
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

1324
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:16,791
I WILL NOT ALLOW THIS.

1325
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,083
I WILL PAY YOU BACK!

1326
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:32,125
- HUH?!  HUH?!

1327
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:37,125
- BECAUSE FORGIVENESS
FOR ONE LIKE YOU

1328
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:39,708
COULD NEVER BE AN OPTION.

1329
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,666
- ( groans )
- TENCHI?

1330
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:43,666
- AAH!
- WHOA.

1331
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,291
- LORD TENCHI.

1332
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,875
- I KNOW-- I CAN SEE HER.

1333
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:50,208
SHE NEEDS MY HELP BADLY.

1334
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:54,958
OH, MOTHER!

1335
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,416
- HUH?

1336
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:04,541
- ( cries )

1337
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,250
( wails )
- TENCHI?

1338
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:21,583
- YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD,

1339
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:23,875
BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

1340
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:26,666
- ( screams )

1341
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,791
( pants )

1342
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:35,166
- ( chuckles )

1343
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:38,000
IF I CAN'T DESTROY YOU,

1344
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:40,375
I'LL ABSORB YOU.

1345
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:42,708
( screams )

1346
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:52,000
COME TO ME NOW!

1347
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:54,125
- ( straining )

1348
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:03,375
NOBOYUKI!

1349
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:06,458
- ( laughing )
- NOBOYUKI!

1350
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:12,625
NOBOYUKI!

1351
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,583
HE'S TOO FAR AWAY.

1352
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:19,083
- ( groaning )

1353
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:20,375
- ( gasps )

1354
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:22,833
- ( groaning )

1355
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:26,833
( screaming )

1356
01:19:26,916 --> 01:19:29,125
- ( grunts )

1357
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:30,750
- WE JUST MADE IT.

1358
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,666
- HANG ON, NOBOYUKI.

1359
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,625
- YOU ARE...

1360
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:39,666
MY SON, TENCHI.

1361
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:46,250
- Kiyone: TWO MINUTES LEFT.
AUTO-THROTTLE ON.

1362
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:48,750
THE FIRST AND SECOND
SAFETY LOCKS ARE NOW OFF.

1363
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,708
THE SHIELD IS LOSING POWER
AND FAST.

1364
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:54,208
- WE'VE STILL GOT
A BIT OF POWER LEFT.

1365
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:57,291
- Kiyone: AND TENCHI?
- I PRAY THAT HE CAN MAKE IT.

1366

1372
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:37,291
THE FINAL SAFETY
IS DISENGAGED,

1373
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,416
BEGINNING FINAL COUNTDOWN.

1374
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,000
HURRY UP, TENCHI, 
AND GET BACK HERE.

1375
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:43,000

- ( roaring )

1386
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:18,625
- THERE'S NO TIME LEFT.

1387

- THERE MUST BE.

1388
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,583

- ( roars )

1390
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:40,083
- LADY ACHIKA?
- WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT?

1391
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:41,875
SHE'S TENCHI'S MOTHER,
ALL RIGHT.

1392
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,875
- ( growls )
- AHHH!

1393
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:04,291
- WHAT IS THE SECRET
OF JURAI POWER?!

1394
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:06,333
- ( sizzles )
- WHAT IS THIS?!

1395
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:09,291
( grunts, groaning )

1396
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:11,166

( sighs )

1400
01:22:48,083 --> 01:22:50,000
- Ryoko: ACHIKA,
WE HAVE TO GO!

1401
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:51,916
- HUH, RIGHT.

1402
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,708
- LET'S HURRY.

1403
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:59,291
- ( gasps, screams )

1404
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:02,000
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE?!

1405
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:04,750
- THE JURAI
WILL NOT ESCAPE ME!

1406
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:07,541
- KAIN'S BACK!

1407
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:08,833
- INCOMING.
- ENGAGE!

1408
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:24,125
- ( Kain screams )

1409
01:23:26,791 --> 01:23:29,375
( screaming echoes )

1410
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:04,875
- KAIN'S GONE.
HE'S REALLY GONE?

1411
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,666
- YES.

1412
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,208
- LET'S GET GOING
AND QUICKLY.

1413
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:13,916
TENCHI REALLY NEEDS HELP.

1414
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,541
- TAKE CARE OF NOBOYUKI,
ALL RIGHT.

1415
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:19,875
- YEAH.

1416
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,125
OF COURSE.

1417
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:24,916
- WHERE ARE SASAMI
AND MIHOSHI?

1418
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,875
- WASHU TRANSFERRED
THEM BACK ALREADY.

1419
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:30,625
- THE TOKYO TOWER'S A WRECK.

1420
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:32,083
IS IT GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT?

1421
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:33,708
- WASHU TOLD ME
THAT THE AUTHORITIES

1422
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:35,166
WILL PROBABLY
CHALK THE WHOLE THING UP

1423
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,791
AS AN UNEXPLAINED EVENT.

1424
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:39,083
THE TOWER WAS DUE
FOR RENOVATION ANYWAY.

1425
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:40,125
( screams )

1426
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,750
- BOTH OF YOU PROMISE ME
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF TENCHI.

1427
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:01,750
ALL RIGHT?

1428
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:05,166
- HMM?
- SO YOU KNEW?

1429
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:08,625
- YES, THE POWER OF THE JURAI
OPENED MY EYES.

1430
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:09,958
AND I SAW...

1431
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:13,333
WHEN TENCHI
WILL NEED ME MOST,

1432
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:15,208
I WON'T BE ABLE TO
BE THERE WITH HIM.

1433
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:25,458
- OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.
- HMM?

1434
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:28,458
- ( grunts )

1435
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,708
IT'S, UH, HERE.

1436
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,166
- WITH KAIN GONE, THE TIME
STREAM'S RETURNED TO NORMAL.

1437
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:42,000
HOWEVER, WE HAVE
TO ERASE YOUR MEMORY

1438
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:45,000
OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
WHILE WE WERE HERE.

1439
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:46,916
I'M SORRY.

1440
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:54,791
- WAIT.

1441
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:55,750
OH MY.

1442
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:59,083
HERE.
- OH.

1443
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:01,083
- I WANT YOU TO GIVE 
THIS SWORD TO TENCHI.

1444
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:03,625
I'M AFRAID HE'S GOING
TO NEED IT AGAIN SOMEDAY.

1445
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,625
- LADY ACHIKA.

1446
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,625
- TIME IS SHORT,

1447
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:22,250
BUT NOBOYUKI AND I 
WILL LIVE OUR LIVES

1448
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:24,208
TO THE FULLEST.
I SWEAR.

1449
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:26,750
THAT'S ALL THAT
REALLY MATTERS.

1450
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,458
- TAKE CARE, LADY.

1451
01:26:34,916 --> 01:26:36,708
- THANK YOU ALL.

1452
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:44,666
IT WAS GOOD
HAVING YOU HERE.

1453
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:47,875
NOW, GOOD-BYE,

1454
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:50,333
MY SON TENCHI.

1455
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:14,625
- Tenchi: AND SO,
THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED

1456
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:16,416
IN MY PARENTS' TIME
WAS RESOLVED.

1457
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:19,250
MY MOTHER LOST THE POWER
THAT KAIN SO FEARED

1458
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:21,875
AND 26 YEARS LATER,
IT PASSED TO ME.

1459
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:23,416
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING

1460
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,000
ABOUT THIS AFFAIR
THAT TROUBLES ME.

1461
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:28,416
THE POWER THAT MY MOTHER
DISPLAYED IN HER FIGHT WITH KAIN

1462
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:31,500
WAS OBVIOUSLY THE POWER
OF THE HOUSE OF JURAI.

1463
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:33,875
AND IN LOSING THAT POWER,

1464
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:36,708
HER OWN LIFE MAY WELL
HAVE BEEN SHORTENED. 

1465
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:38,125
IRONICALLY,

1466
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:40,875
THE JURAI POWER
SHE USED TO SAVE MY LIFE

1467
01:27:40,958 --> 01:27:44,500
WAS THE POWER THAT COULD HAVE
ENABLED HER TO LIVE LONGER.

1468
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,750
I'M AWARE THAT THE PAST
CANNOT BE CHANGED,

1469
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:51,333
BUT SOMETIMES
IT IS HARD TO ACCEPT.

1470
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:52,791
- ( silent )

1471
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:54,125
- Tenchi: I WISH I COULD
REACH BACK

1472
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:56,375
AND UNDO WHAT
HAS BEEN DONE, BUT...

1473
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:59,166
I MUST ACCEPT
WHAT I CANNOT CHANGE.

1474
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:02,291
FORTUNATELY, I HAVE BEEN TOLD
THAT MY PARENTS WERE ABLE

1475
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:04,458
TO SPEND THEIR
YOUNG YEARS TOGETHER,

1476
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:07,125
HAPPILY DREAMING
AND PLANNING,

1477
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,666
AND BUILDING
FOR THE FUTURE.

1478
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,125
- ( baby cries )

1479
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:17,625
- WELL, THE BABY'S FINE,
FORTUNATELY.

1480
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:19,000
AND THEY SAY THAT ACHIKA
WILL BE OUT

1481
01:28:19,083 --> 01:28:20,875
OF THE HOSPITAL NEXT WEEK.
- HMM.

1482
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:22,500
IS THAT SO?

1483
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:27,416
- Noboyuki:
THE COMPANY HAS AGREED

1484
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,125
TO LET ME
DESIGN A BUILDING.

1485
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:32,166
I GUESS THEY'RE FINALLY
RECOGNIZING MY TALENTS.

1486
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:34,166
- Katsuhito: IS THAT SO?

1487
01:28:39,666 --> 01:28:41,541
- Noboyuki: YOU KNOW, DAD,
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

1488
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:43,833
REBUILDING THIS HOUSE
ONE OF THESE DAYS.

1489
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:47,250
- Katsuhito: YOU DON'T SAY?
IS THAT SO?

1490
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:55,375
- MY NEXT BIG PROJECT
IS TO BUILD THE DREAM HOUSE

1491
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:57,250
ACHIKA AND I HAVE
ALWAYS WANTED.

1492
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:01,875
BY THE WAY, DAD,

1493
01:29:01,958 --> 01:29:04,375
WE REALLY SHOULD THINK ABOUT
A NAME FOR THE BABY.

1494
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:05,916
GOT ANY IDEAS?

1495
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,250
- HMM?  LET ME THINK.

1496
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:10,666

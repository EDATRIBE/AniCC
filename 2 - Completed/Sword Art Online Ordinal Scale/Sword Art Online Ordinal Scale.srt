they could not log out.

if a player died in‐game,

the next‐gen wearable device.

52

If you compare the Augma
with its predecessor,

the AmuSphere,

54
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:38,097
you might think since it doesn't
have a FullDive function,

55

it's a step backward,
technology‐wise.

56

But that's so totally not true.

the Augma doesn't come
with any of the risks

something's up with us,

690
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,475
so she's been grilling me
about you.

691
00:38:21,518 --> 00:38:24,398
‐Oh, right, that news.
‐Mm‐hm.

692
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:26,318
She's not mad or anything.

693
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,364
But we should figure out
how to tell her.

694
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,243
Yeah. You're right.

695
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:33,667
Daddy! Mommy! I found
something out about the game!

696
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:36,130
YUI: I have something
to show everyone.

697
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:38,886
So far, when a boss monster
has appeared at an event,

698
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:41,307
it has always been at 9:00 p. m.

699
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:43,729
This is the location
where Mommy and Daddy

700
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,066
fought Kagachi the Samurai Lord
the other day.

701
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:50,993
And this is the location
where Mommy fought last night.

702
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:52,830
In a few seconds,
you'll see the locations

703
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,918
where the other
nine bosses appeared.

704
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,546
I'll also superimpose

705
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:58,466
a flattened map
of Old Aincrad over it.

706
00:38:59,761 --> 00:39:01,305
No way!

a boss showed up in <i>OS</i>

708
00:39:03,184 --> 00:39:06,357
lines up with a dungeon
from Old Aincrad!

709
00:39:06,398 --> 00:39:09,404
The admin seem to have picked
open spaces in the city,

710
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:12,077
with coordinates that most
closely match the dungeons.

711
00:39:12,118 --> 00:39:14,666
With this,
we can make certain predictions.

712
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:18,339
For example, tonight at 9:00,
a boss will most likely appear

713
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:20,301
at the Ebisu Garden Place
in Shibuya.

he ever actually joined it.

1000
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:04,350
But by the looks of it,

1001
00:56:04,392 --> 00:56:06,104
Asuna's brain seems
to have undergone

1002
00:56:06,145 --> 00:56:08,149
some kind
of limited memory scan.

1003
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,320
KIRITO: Limited memory scan?

1004
00:56:10,362 --> 00:56:13,536
So like, whatever did this only
targeted her memories of <i>SAO</i> ?

1005
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,997
How's that even possible?

1006
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,625
I can think of one way,
actually.

1007
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:18,378
If she were put in a situation,

1008
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,550
which forced her to recall
moments in <i>SAO</i> ,

1009
00:56:20,592 --> 00:56:22,971
the single neurons connected
to those memories

1010
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:25,017
would be identified.

1011
00:56:25,058 --> 00:56:27,354
Then by showering the neurons
with electron pulses,

1012
00:56:27,396 --> 00:56:30,027
the image of each memory
is scanned.

1013
00:56:30,068 --> 00:56:31,864
In the past few days,

1014
00:56:31,906 --> 00:56:33,325
there've been multiple reports
of people with symptoms

1015
00:56:33,366 --> 00:56:34,912
similar to Asuna's.

1016
00:56:34,953 --> 00:56:38,001
It could be a coincidence,
but I doubt it.

1017

in common.

1022

Well, as of right now,

1023

I don't see any sign of actual
physical damage to her brain.

1024
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,291
My theory is, her ability
to recall her memories

1025
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,546
was affected
because the electron pulses

1026
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:02,509
degenerated her spine.

1027
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,556
Unfortunately, I can't tell
whether or not she'll show

1028

any further symptoms
until I run some more tests.

1030
00:57:10,525 --> 00:57:13,698
there's still a chance she'll
lose even more of her memories?

01:08:54,306 --> 01:08:56,018
I know this guy.

1207
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,356
YUI: That's
Professor Tetsuhiro Shigemura.

1208
01:08:58,397 --> 01:08:59,692
He designed the Augma.

1209
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,619
KIRITO: He did, huh?

1210
01:09:07,165 --> 01:09:08,794
SHIGEMURA:
Based on the evidence,

1211
01:09:08,835 --> 01:09:11,256
the most glaring flaw
in a FullDive VR device

1212
01:09:11,298 --> 01:09:14,179
is the FullDive function itself.

1213
01:09:14,221 --> 01:09:16,726
When a person has to sever
their physical senses

1214
01:09:16,768 --> 01:09:19,524
to play a VR game,
that person is taking on

1215
01:09:19,565 --> 01:09:21,861
incalculable risks
to their health.

1216
01:09:21,903 --> 01:09:23,573
True, FullDive tech

1217
01:09:23,615 --> 01:09:26,286
has been applied
to activities other than gaming

1218
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:29,836
such as communication, browsing,
and digital production.

1219
01:09:29,877 --> 01:09:33,342
But none of those activities
require all of one's senses.

1220
01:09:33,384 --> 01:09:36,891
Sight, sound and limited tactile
information are enough.

1221
01:09:36,933 --> 01:09:39,479
So instead of using
a dangerous FullDive device,

1222
01:09:39,522 --> 01:09:41,693
one should use an AR device,

1223
01:09:41,735 --> 01:09:44,322
which has been proven
to be safe and stable.

1224
01:09:46,118 --> 01:09:48,749
Are there any questions
on what we've covered so far?

1225
01:09:51,713 --> 01:09:53,049
Yes. You there.

1226
01:09:54,677 --> 01:09:57,140
Professor,
would you say AR devices

1227
01:09:57,182 --> 01:09:59,896
have certain risks
that VR devices don't?

1228
01:09:59,937 --> 01:10:01,858
If so,
what are your thoughts on that?

1229
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,739
Yes, well, are you talking
about traffic accidents,

1230
01:10:04,781 --> 01:10:06,659
while wearing an AR device?

1231
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:09,999
No. I'm talking about risks
like permanently altering

1232
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:13,089
and damaging the user's
perception of reality.

1233
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:14,759
FullDive tech

1234
01:10:14,801 --> 01:10:16,721
just makes a virtual world
seem like reality.

1235
01:10:16,763 --> 01:10:18,809
But AR tech
alters reality itself.

1236
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,395
Don't you think
that's dangerous?

1237
01:10:20,436 --> 01:10:23,944
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

1238
01:10:23,985 --> 01:10:26,323
I'll answer that question
next time.

KIRITO:
I'll cut right to the chase.

1241
01:10:30,331 --> 01:10:32,377
Do you know someone named Eiji?

1242
01:10:32,419 --> 01:10:34,757
He's the second rank player
in <i>Ordinal Scale.</i>

1243
01:10:34,799 --> 01:10:36,511
No.

1244
01:10:36,553 --> 01:10:39,015
But he was in your class
and he even took your lab.

1245
01:10:39,057 --> 01:10:41,186
I've had many students
over the years.

1246
01:10:41,228 --> 01:10:43,023
Okay, let's try
a different question.

1247
01:10:43,065 --> 01:10:44,819
Did you know that the Augma

1248
01:10:44,861 --> 01:10:47,783
is causing <i>SAO</i> survivors
to lose their memories?

1249
01:10:47,825 --> 01:10:49,662
Did you know
the Augma has a feature

1250
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,583
users don't know about?

1251
01:10:51,624 --> 01:10:54,463
A feature that scans their brain
while they're wearing it?

1252
01:10:54,505 --> 01:10:58,012
(SIGHS) I didn't know
I was going to be interrogated.

1253
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,475
Kikuoka told me you just wanted
to audit my class.

1254
01:11:00,517 --> 01:11:03,355
If the Augma does have
a dangerous feature built in,

1255
01:11:03,397 --> 01:11:05,611
it won't be long
before it's found out.

1256
01:11:05,652 --> 01:11:07,573
And once that happens,

1257
01:11:07,615 --> 01:11:10,453
the Augma's gonna be banned,
just like the NerveGear was.

1258
01:11:10,495 --> 01:11:12,457
And you?

1259
01:11:12,499 --> 01:11:15,631
You'll end up the same as your
former student, Akihiko Kayaba.

1260
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:18,052
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1261
01:11:18,093 --> 01:11:19,722
But let's say the Augma

1262
01:11:19,764 --> 01:11:21,726
has this brain‐scanning function
you described,

1263
01:11:21,768 --> 01:11:24,397
why is it bad if someone
forgets about <i>SAO</i> ?

1264
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:26,276
In the words of Nietzsche,

1265
01:11:26,318 --> 01:11:27,905
"Blessed are the forgetful,

1266
01:11:27,947 --> 01:11:30,117
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

1267
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,873
So now ask yourself,
do you think those survivors

1268
01:11:32,915 --> 01:11:34,710
want to remember
their horrifying past?

but I might as well
confirm it for you.

1280
01:12:18,965 --> 01:12:20,969
The cause of death
was the NerveGear.

What the hell's he trying
to prove?

1284
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,946
Well, maybe he honestly
thinks he's doing good

1285

<i>by making</i>
<i>the</i> SAO <i>survivors forget.</i>

1286
01:12:32,785 --> 01:12:35,206
Yeah, well,
I can't prove it yet,

1287
01:12:35,248 --> 01:12:37,920

dangerous to users.

Please, Mr. Kikuoka.
Shut down the service.

1290
01:12:41,803 --> 01:12:44,224
The Ministry of Economy
is tied up with this,

1291
01:12:44,266 --> 01:12:47,856
so we have to be careful
with how we proceed.

1292
01:12:47,898 --> 01:12:50,571

you've told me.

1293
01:12:50,612 --> 01:12:52,908
But I can't move without proof.

1294

<i>A bunch of the</i> Ordinal Scale
<i>players are</i> SAO <i>survivors.</i>

1295
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:59,337
And if they fight any
of the bosses from Old Aincrad,

1296
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:01,843
you're gonna have a lot more
people losing their memories.

1297
01:13:01,885 --> 01:13:04,557
I know
and I'm doing the best I can.

1298
01:13:04,599 --> 01:13:06,978
I checked with the hospital
about Klein and his friends

1299
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,274
and confirmed their symptoms
with the doctors.

1300
01:13:09,316 --> 01:13:11,153
But I'm more concerned

1301
01:13:11,194 --> 01:13:13,533
about their broken bones
than their memories.

1302
01:13:13,575 --> 01:13:16,246
You should take
your own advice and don't fight
any more bosses.

are important to me, too.

Come on, this way.

1324
01:14:21,544 --> 01:14:25,301
I was talking to someone today
and they said survivors like us

1325
01:14:25,343 --> 01:14:28,182
are better off forgetting
what happened in <i>SAO.</i>

1326
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:31,606
I got to thinking and maybe
he's got a point there.

1327
01:14:31,648 --> 01:14:33,818
We saw a lot
of horrible things happen.

1328
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,323
It was scary and sad.

1329
01:14:36,365 --> 01:14:39,412
But the memories
we have of those two years,

1330
01:14:39,454 --> 01:14:42,836
good and bad, are what shaped us
into the people we are today.

1331
01:14:47,513 --> 01:14:50,852
Everyone's been telling me about
how high‐tech your room is.

It's not what I thought.

1333
01:14:53,107 --> 01:14:56,238

01:15:34,899 --> 01:15:37,445
It's been a long time since
I've written in this diary.

1340
01:15:37,487 --> 01:15:39,282
These days, I'm worried
I'll forget what's happened

1341
01:15:39,324 --> 01:15:41,621
to me since I came back
to the real world,

1342
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:44,668
so I'll write how I feel now
in case I do.

1343
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,423
I met Kirito four years ago,

1344
01:15:47,465 --> 01:15:49,762
but I only remember
the last two.

1345
01:15:49,804 --> 01:15:51,724
The moments with him,

1346
01:15:51,766 --> 01:15:54,605
I can still remember,
are precious, like jewels.

1347
01:15:54,647 --> 01:15:57,235
There's a good chance
Ordinal Scale

1348
01:15:57,276 --> 01:15:59,532
will cause me to forget things
more and more.

1349
01:15:59,573 --> 01:16:01,911
And that scares me.

1350
01:16:01,953 --> 01:16:04,834
But as long as I can
keep making new memories
with Kirito,

1351
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:06,963
I should be fine.

1352
01:16:07,004 --> 01:16:10,052
My calendar says I'm supposed
to go to the mountains

1353
01:16:10,094 --> 01:16:13,601
in Saitama in a couple of days
to watch the stars with him.

1354
01:16:13,643 --> 01:16:15,522
But I don't remember the day

1355
01:16:15,564 --> 01:16:18,528
we made plans
to go there anymore.

1356
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:21,993
I went back and read this diary
and from what I can tell,

1357
01:16:22,034 --> 01:16:25,499
Kirito said he wanted to give
me some kind of present.

1358
01:16:25,542 --> 01:16:28,338
I hope he'll forgive me
for not remembering what.

1359
01:16:29,633 --> 01:16:31,470
I want to get him something,

1360
01:16:31,512 --> 01:16:33,808
but since I'm not allowed
to have a job yet,

1361
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:36,856
I'm going to use all my points
and whatever I have saved

1362
01:16:36,898 --> 01:16:39,570
to buy him a gift.

1363
01:16:39,612 --> 01:16:44,496
My beloved Kirito.
What will I do if I forget him?

1364
01:16:44,538 --> 01:16:47,711
What will I do if I forget
these feelings I have?

1365
01:16:47,753 --> 01:16:50,759
And what if it turns out
I can't make new memories
with him?

1366
01:16:52,303 --> 01:16:55,017
It scares me
to even think about it.

1367
01:16:55,059 --> 01:16:57,898
I pray that the person
I am tomorrow

1368
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:00,987
doesn't forget the feelings
I have for him now.

It's not a bad thing.

1883
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:31,595
I got to sing in front
of a huge audience,

1884
01:49:31,637 --> 01:49:34,935
so my wish was fulfilled.
I couldn't be happier.

1885
01:49:34,977 --> 01:49:38,275
Before I go,
I have to give this back to you.

1886
01:49:38,316 --> 01:49:39,903
Your fear of death

1887
01:49:39,945 --> 01:49:41,991
is what caused you
to lose your memories.

1888
01:49:42,032 --> 01:49:45,247
But you overcame it
and fought anyway.

1889
01:49:45,289 --> 01:49:47,919
I'm sure everything
will come back to you now.

at the New National Stadium,

1894
01:50:52,089 --> 01:50:55,179

<i>from</i> Ordinal Scale <i>appeared.</i>

1895
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:57,016
The promoters of the show
said today

1896
01:50:57,057 --> 01:50:59,855
that it was a surprise event
for the fans.

that their head of development,

has decided to step down.

more girls in AR.

1906

Eh, it's no big deal.

1907
01:51:26,784 --> 01:51:29,247
Nobody meets their dream girl
in games, anyway.

never hears you say that.

Yo, she gave up her ticket

‐Ow! What's your problem?
‐Apologize!

1911
01:51:37,179 --> 01:51:39,726
Um, guys, I brought
something back for everyone.

1912
01:51:39,768 --> 01:51:41,939
Where was this boot camp
you went to?

1913

LEAFA: Shimane.

1914
01:51:43,651 --> 01:51:45,153
The place we stayed
didn't have computers.

they had other plans tonight.

Oh, who cares about them.

1922
01:51:57,679 --> 01:51:59,432
If they're not here,
they're missing out.

1923
01:51:59,473 --> 01:52:01,269
Some friend.

1924
01:52:01,311 --> 01:52:03,983
I get discharged and he can't
come by for a drink?

1925
01:52:04,025 --> 01:52:05,193
He can suck it.

1926
01:52:05,235 --> 01:52:06,655
On second thought,

1927
01:52:06,697 --> 01:52:07,866
you can buy
your own drinks tonight.

1928
01:52:07,908 --> 01:52:09,578
You all owe me for that ticket.

Yeah. Can you see, Yui?

Yup! I can see
just fine, Daddy!

each other back in Aincrad now?

What, to go stargazing?

1948

Well, yeah. That was part of it.

I'm kidding. I remember.

You'd better talk

Please don't
kill me, man.

00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,541
I'll tell you everything
you wanna know!

00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,291
I was hired by Yoros--

Hey, screw you man!

10
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,166
Well this took
a turn for the worse.

Ah! Ah!

00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,541

[LOBSTER] You idiot. You've been
killing people left and right.

20
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,541
That lack of discretion
has landed you

21
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,791
on your sponsor's shit list.

22
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,958

[NINJA SLAYER] Do you have
a death haiku prepared?

Why would I do that?
I'm not gonna die tonight.

32
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500

I am Darkninja.

I am pleased to see you

00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,666
doing so well, Darkninja-san.

60
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,916
I feared that I'd
wasted my time on you.

61
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,791
[DARKNINJA]
Huh?

62
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,625
The shards of Beppin.

63
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,625
I recovered both the hilt
and broken blade

64
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,333
from the place of your defeat.

65
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:53,083
You really should take better
care of your things.

66
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,958
[DARKNINJA]
Could this be the end?

67
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,625
[TORTOISE] You have time
to live yet, Darkninja.

68
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,833
Destiny has
a purpose for you.

69
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,875
Thus you've been preserved.

70
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:13,333
[DARKNINJA] Uh. It was you
who told me I would live.

71
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,041
You'll want to search
for Thunder Forge-san.

72
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,958
For he can mend your sword.

73
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,583
In fact, no man aside from
him could possibly do it.

74
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:26,375
Thunder Forge-san is the finest
smith that hasn't croaked yet.

75
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,500
Anyone but him would fail you.

76
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,708
You say he's called
Thunder Forge?

77
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,625
I've never heard of a
sword-smith by that name.

78
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,916
Well It's not like
you've been looking.

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll see you soon.
Take care of yourself!

Fuegan is not for everyone.

81
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,291
Side effects include brain
damage, projectile tooth loss,

82
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,500
cancer, and rectal bleeding.

83
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,833
Ask your doctor if
Fuegan is right for you,

84
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,166
and tell him if you develop
suicidal thoughts

85
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,625
after taking it. Fuegan.

86
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,375
Tear your migraine

Aaah...

Aaah!

90
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,458
Even now, it moves.

91
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:18,041
Could this mean that some of the
bio-tissue can be salvaged?

92
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:27,166
Damn you to hell
Ninja Slayer-san...

93
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,291
Thus I swear on
this severed pincer

94
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,333
that I will create another
Lobster-san, and then--

95
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,666
Hmmm.

96
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,916
That I'll create
another lobster-san and then--

97
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,250
Hmmm.

98
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,208
I swear by this pincer
to create another Lobster-san!

Both swift and strong!

100
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,791
And when he is finished

101
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:53,041
I shall exact a most
brutal revenge!

I do hope that

105
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,458
gets here soon for your sake.

106
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,125
It'd be a shame for such a
voluptuous and tech-savvy woman

107
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,583
to be tossed into the pot.

Why would you

I craved revenge,

But in the future,

This time was simply
the result of

I promise you,
it won't happen again.

[NANCY] Strange. A little adage
just popped into my head.

Should you destroy
what a man loves most,

00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,541
he'll cling tighter
to the pieces

165

than he ever did
the thing itself.

166
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,708

dwells deep inside of him,

173
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,500
his fighting spirit, wants
nothing more in the world

174
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,208
than to turn and run
from the terror before him!

175
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,958
The terrifying might
of the Ninja Slayer!

176
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,666
[MYRMIDON]
Yeeart!

177
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,541
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[MYRMIDON] Aaaargh!

178
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,666
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

179
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,291
[MYRMIDON]
Aaaargh!

180
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,083
Sayonara!

181
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:16,541
[NINJA SLAYER laughs intensely]

182
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,833
[NARRATOR] And with these
three ninjas dead and gone,

183
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:23,000
Ninja Slayer begins his
bloody quest for vengeance.

184
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,833
The road he was
just beginning to travel

185
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,500
will be a long one indeed.

186
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,916
And it will most certainly
be littered with the dead

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,125
and dying bodies of countless
ninjas along the way.

188
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,583
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

189
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,791
[cell phone static]

190
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,250
[beep]

191
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,416
[ALL]
Here you go big daddy.

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,916
Kill him!

193
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,000
Consider it done.

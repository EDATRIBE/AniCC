trying to explain it

185
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,875
to a renegade like you.

186
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,833
[NINJA SLAYER] Then explain
it with your Karate!

187
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,125
[DARKNINJA] I already told
you, I don't have the time!

188
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,250
[DARKNINJA grunts]

189
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,708
[DARKNINJA]
Uh?

190
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,458
[NINJA SLAYER] You're not
getting away that easily!

191
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,083
[DARKNINJA]
You mad dog!

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,625
[NARRATOR] So, what did you
think of Ninja Slayer's battles?

193
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,958
Slaying ninja after ninja!

194
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,541
Ninja Slayer will not stop

195
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,541
until he has slain all the evil
ninjas that plague this world!

196
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,083
Carnage!

00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,291
I just can't catch a break.

00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,916
[PURPLE HAT]
What the hell?

4
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,708
Damned rioters.

5
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,458
I've got somewhere to be!

6
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,958
What's up their butts?

7
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,208
Omura Industries is building
a new dam, and these people

8
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,708
are whining that it'll flood
their homes or something.

9
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,083
So these activists are blocking
the whole damn highway

10
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,708
as some sort of protest.

11
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,125
Why don't they just move?

12
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,541
This thing's a real CF.
But it's gonna be over soon.

13
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,875
You know something?

14
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,541
[RED SCARF] I heard Omura
is gonna send some kinda

15
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,750
crowd control weapon. So we'll
be sitting here a bit longer,

16
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,625
but at least we'll get one
hell of a fireworks show.

17
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,041
[PURPLE HAT] Yeah, I don't know
if I like the sound of that.

18
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,958
Omura doesn't play around,
that's for sure.

19
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,666
I know I wouldn't want
to get in their way.

20
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,833

[whimpering]

27
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,708
[NARRATOR] A barricade set up

inconvenienced commuters

29
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,791
and incurred the wrath
of Omura Industries.

30
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,375
It's turned into urban warfare!

I am Motoryab.

34
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,958
I've been sent here on
behalf of Omura Industries.

35
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,583
We politely request your
immediate surrender.

36
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,250
Okay, I surrender!

37
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,625
Please don't kill me!

38
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,750
[MOTORYAB]
Thank you sir.

39
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,625
Your surrender
has been accepted.

Go tell them and I'll
hold these things off!

[RESISTANCE B] The situation
is out of our control!

50
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,416
They sent in these huge
robots to take us out!

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,750
We're screwed!

52
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,833
Our weapons are no match
for their gatling cannons!

53
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,500
What are we gonna do?

54
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,500
Heartless bastards finally
sent in the Motoryabs.

55
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,041
What are you talking about?

56
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,750
Omura's new robo-ninjas.
They're killing machines.

57
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,458
What do you
suggest that we do?

58
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,583
[RAPTURE]
The technology is new,

59
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,375
and rumored to
be indestructible.

60
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,375
Tonight, we begin the
toughest fight of our lives.

[EXPLOSIVE laughs]

and lightning fast reflexes
of an actual ninja!

I didn't realize that
you were a true ninja.

81
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,500
That is correct.
Domo, Leader-san.

82
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,958
I am Rapture.

got a ninja on our hands!

00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,666
[EXPLOSIVE] Allow me
to introduce myself.

Domo. I am known as Explosive.

00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,625
Well. Domo to you,
Explosive-san.

how can I counter it?

[RAPTURE, RESISTANCE LEADER]
Argh!

00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:56,000
That's a tough one, kid.
Ya blink your eyes, and ka-boom!

00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,625
Your guts get blown to
bits all over the place.

97
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,708
Like a bunch of confetti
made outta meat.

98
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,208
A true ninja can take your life

99
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,166
before you realize
he's even there.

100
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,500
But seeing you
helpless like this

101
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,541
makes me wonder
if you even are one.

102
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,000

No. Just a stupid little girl.

106
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:24,583
To be a real ninja, you gotta
have a ninja soul inside you!

107
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,375
That's something ya
can't fake, sweetheart.

And now to watch
the fireworks.

Go on! Someone like you
deserves to go out with a bang!

No. It can't be.
You're Ninja Slayer-san!

I am Ninja Slayer.

Domo, Yukano-san.

126
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,250
Yukano? I don't know that name.

127

[NARRATOR] And with this
tidbit of information we learn

128
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,041
that Dragon Yukano's ninja
nom-de-guerre, Amnesia,

129
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:21,208
is a very fitting one indeed.
She doesn't remember a thing!

130
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,708
I've heard you don't
remember a thing,

00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,000

You've just met.

But you and Rapture-san are
gonna light up the sky together.

He's covered head to
toe with explosives!

Huh?

00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,625
Go...

[RAPTURE]
This is it for me.

140
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,291
I wish I could've
done something useful.

141
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,750
At least my death
will be kind of cool.

00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,833
Boom-boom.

143
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,583
Rapture-san, no!

144
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,750
Now!

We finally get to see
some fireworks tonight!

Go on Yukano, and take
the leader with you.

149
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,333

to continue fighting.

Death is the only way out
for everybody isn't it?

153
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:22,083
But you'll be making your final
exit right here and right now!

154
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,166
Me and my robo-buddy are
gonna make sure of that.

fuse one after another,

167
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,708

than half a second!

No! This is

I didn't even get a real
chance to attack him yet!

[NINJA SLAYER] I told you death
was the only way out for Ninjas.

But seeing you now makes me
doubt if you truly are one.

Hey. You don't
have to rub it in!

00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,083
What in the hell do
you think you're doing?

178
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,291
These will detonate whether
you press the button or not,

179
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,375
won't they?

180
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,333
Recite your death haiku,
if you have one.

181
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,375
[EXPLOSIVE] It's too ironic!
Blown up by my own fireworks!

182
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,666
Spare me and I'll talk!

183
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,000
I've heard enough yammering,
so sayonara.

184
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,083
[EXPLOSIVE]
I'm not ready to die!

185
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,250
[NINJA SLAYER]
That's too bad.

186
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,958
[EXPLOSIVE]
Sayonara!

187
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,166
Domo, Ninja Slayer-san.

188
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,625
I owe you my life.

189
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,375
Yes, I know. You're welcome.

190
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,000
But, where is Yuk--
I mean Amnesia-san?

191
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,916
[MALE RESISTANCE LEADER] She
told me to give this to you.

192
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,833
[AMNESIA]
"Domo, Ninja Slayer-san.

193
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,833
Earlier you called me Yukano,

194
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,625
but that name belongs to a girl
whose life I don't remember.

195
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,458
I have a new life now,
here with the Ikki Uchikowashi.

196
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,541
They treat me as one of
their own, like family.

197
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,416
In fact, Rapture-san
and I were planning

198
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,458
on becoming husband and wife.
We were deeply in love.

199
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,875
But after losing him tonight,

200
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,541
I must wait here for more
reinforcements to join us.

201
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,500
I must also take some
time to mourn his death.

202
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,875
I'm sorry to tell you this,

203
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,250
but the person you came
looking for is gone forever.

204
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,000
So, I'm afraid I won't
be able to help you.

205
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,458
Although, both the
resistance and I

206
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,208
will be forever in your debt
for what you did tonight.

207
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,375
And for avenging...

208
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:14,333
[NINJA SLAYER] Give this to
Yuk-- I mean, Amnesia-san.

209
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,208
[RESISTANCE LEADER]
The sun is rising again.

This is gonna be great!

00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,833
And I'm so glad you
came with us, Yamoto-san!

3
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,916
Meeting you was
luckier than I thought!

The more the merrier!

8
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,416
I think that's gonna be
just a little too much.

9
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,125
They'll have to send
everything in the kitchen.

10
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,291
I couldn't really tell
if it was doing anything.

11
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,666
Well it looks like fun!

Yo!

[MACHI]
Ooh, my turn!

15
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,083
There're barely any songs
in here I actually like.

16
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,583
Yeah, no kidding.

17
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,666
[gasps] Hold on,
I'll be right back.

18
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,083
[SHOGO]
Domo. My name is Shogo.

19
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,708
Domo. I am Yamoto.

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,500
You came here looking
for me, didn't you?

21
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,333
I did. You know why.

22
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,625
I mean, you can tell,
can't you?

23
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,125
[YAMOTO]
What do you mean?

24
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,916
[SHOGO] It was crazy
to see you again.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,791
But finding out you'd become
a ninja totally blew my mind.

26
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,416
[FEMALE ELEVATOR VOICE 04A]
Bong! Fifth floor!

27
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,750
[SHOGO] Buddha fuck!
That's them.

28
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,291
We're out of time!

29
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,125
You gotta listen to me.
This is some life or death shit!

30
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,750
I'm a ninja, just like you.
After that big brawl,

31
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,833
I got recruited by
the Soukai Syndicate.

32
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,958
I had no choice. It was
either join them, or die.

33
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,750
They're gonna try and do
the exact same thing to you.

34
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,208
They'll be here any second!

35
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,333
[SONIC BOOM]
Suicide!

36
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,041
You should get the hell
outta here right now!

37
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,291
Run away!

38
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,291
[SONIC BOOM] Suicide-san!
It's getting late,

39
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,041
and I need to
get my beauty rest.

00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,666
[SHOGO exhales deeply]

41
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,208
[SONIC BOOM]
Oh, there you are.

42
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,416
Having a nice chat?
Discussing our family?

43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,166
Domo, Yamoto Koki-san.

44
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,000
I am known as Sonic Boom.
A Soukai Six Gates Ninja.

45
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,375
I see you've met
my fluffy headed associate,

46
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,083
Suicide-san.

47
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,916
We've come here
tonight to offer you

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,666
the once-in-a-lifetime
chance to be

49
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,458
a full-fledged Soukai Ninja.

50
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,500
[SONIC BOOM] Think of it as an
achievement, a badge of honor.

51
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,958
Even Suicide here
puts some value on his life

52
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,833
now that he's one of us.

53
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,958
[SONIC BOOM]
The syndicate can show you

54
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,958
your true purpose.

55
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,000
You can redeem yourself!

56
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,750
You understand me,
don't you? There's hope.

57
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,666
Even for a despicable
parent-killer.

58
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,375
[YAMOTO gasps]

59
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,750
[SONIC BOOM] I can't
imagine you'd refuse

60
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,625
this generous offer. Unless
you want me to kill you.

61
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,750
And if that's the case,

62
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,708
I'll oblige after
I have a little fun.

63
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:34,000
[SHOGO] Yamoto-san, I
apologize for all this crap.

64
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,625
I take full responsibility.
Please forgive me.

like me. You have friends.

People who care about you.
No Soukai has that.

are a bunch of dicks.

You need to run. Right now!

We can't just
leave 'im here!

It's okay.
I'll take care of it.

84

But how?

to stand your ground.

I do admire your tenacity.

[SONIC BOOM] So you're
a psychic ninja as well.

95
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,458
Very surprising for someone
to harness the gift

at such a young age.

97
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,208
But, as throughout history,

karate is the one who rises.

into your tiny skull.

is joining the Soukaiya and
killing who we tell you to.

You'll never repay your
debt to society or family,

just give in.

using skin and blood

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,416
in lieu of canvas and oils.

174
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,416
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

175
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,833
[SONIC BOOM]
Aaaargh! Now, you die!

176
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,958
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

177
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,208
[SONIC BOOM]
Aaaargh!

178
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,458
Yeeart!

179
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,833
[NARRATOR]
In the ancient Edo period,

180
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,291
and in the American South,
it is said that

181
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,083
even if a poor gun
shoots a lot of bullets,

182
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,333
it will eventually hit.

183
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,166
But that may be
wishful thinking.

184
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,083
I don't get it! You should
be full of holes by now!

185
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,125
Aaaargh!

186
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,458
The fact that I am not
means this fight is over.

187
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,000
Recite your death haiku.
Before it's too late.

188
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,708
You cocky bastard.

189
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,208
You're not callin'
the shots here,

190
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,083
so prepare to die!

191
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,458
[SONIC BOOM]
Huh?

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,833
What the hell?
What the hell is that thing?

193
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,291
That is not origami!

194
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,791
[SONIC BOOM]
I'm gonna shred it!

195
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,541
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

196
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,625
[SONIC BOOM]
Aaaargh!

197
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,875
[SONIC BOOM]
Aaaargh!

198
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,916
[SONIC BOOM grunting]

199
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,958
[YAMOTO]
Go!

200
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,083
[SONIC BOOM]
Sayonara!

201
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,041
[NINJA SLAYER]
Domo. I am Ninja Slayer.

202
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,250
Thanks. Domo to you,
Ninja Slayer-san.

203
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,041
I am Yamoto Koki.

204
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,166
All of this destruction
was your handiwork?

205
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,541
I caused all this, yes,
because they provoked me.

206
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,750
But now,
I think I'm done here.

207
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,666
It would seem that way.

208
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,375
[NARAKU]
Kill her, Fujikido!

209
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,083
This girl is possessed
by that minx, Shi Ninja!

210
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,583
But she's completely
exhausted herself.

211
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,333
It would be easy,
like scratching an itch!

212
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,625
Carry out your vengeance!

213
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,208
[NINJA SLAYER] Silence!
This is my road!

214
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,500
My vengeance that must be
paid in the blood of ninjas!

215
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,000
Not yours!

216
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,708
[NARAKU] We agreed that you
would kill every last ninja!

217
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,083
Failure is not an option!

218
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,666
[YAMOTO gasps]

219
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,375
[NINJA SLAYER groans]

220
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,125
[NINJA SLAYER]
Leave! Now!

221
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,916
[knock, knock]

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,916
[gasps]

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,750
Aieee!

224
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,416
I don't believe it!
You're alive!

225
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,125
[YAMOTO] I should've
come sooner. I'm sorry.

226
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,083
[ASARI sobbing]

227
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,250
Truth is,
I'm a bad luck charm.

228
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,583
Trouble follows me around.

229
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,166
All we did was
go do some karaoke,

230
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,583
and we almost get killed.
Because I was there.

231
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:27,416
[ASARI sobbing]

232
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,208
Is this sayonara, forever?

233
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,041
Please don't
think of it like that.

234
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,583
If you need me,
I'll come running.

235
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,833
Sayonara...

236
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,916
...dear friend.

237
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,416
Best friend.

238
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,375
[YAMOTO]
Yeeart!

1
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,958
[NARRATOR]
Making his way towards the keep

2
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,083
in which Laomoto
has ensconced himself,

3
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,208
Ninja Slayer battles
through the Six Gates,

4
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,083
with plenty of
backup from Nancy.

5
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:53,666
[NANCY] The first ninja
was Devilfish-san.

6
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,125
The multiple mechanical
arms were a problem,

7
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,541
but once his head was
gone, it was game over.

8
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,625
Ninja Slayer fought
long and hard.

9
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,916
The next ninja
was Razoredge-san.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,833
He had ceramic katanas
attached all over his body.

11
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,375
I mean, everywhere.

12
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,541
But even the katanas hidden
in his ears couldn't help him.

13
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,500
Once he was nailed to
the wall, it was game over.

14
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,500
Ninja Slayer fought
long and hard.

15
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,708
The next ninja
was Waterboard-san,

16
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,208
master of scuba jitsu.

17
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,625
He filled the room with water,

18
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,958
and attacked him with his
underwater combat skills.

19
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,458
But, once his air
supply was cut off,

20
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,750
it was game over.

21
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,541
Ninja Slayer fought
long and hard.

22
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,416
I was able to drain the
room and help him escape.

23
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,208
But then his head was filled
with some kind of noise.

24
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,083
Even still, he moved
on to the fourth room.

25
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,375
The next ninja
was Armadillo-san.

26
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,625
He was covered in armor
stronger than steel,

27
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,458
but once his spine was snapped,

28
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,208
it was game over.

29
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,958
Ninja Slayer fought
long and hard.

30
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,916
The noise inside his head
came back even stronger.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,583
It was the voices of all
the ninjas he'd slain.

32
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,166
All those tormented souls,
screaming in anguish.

33
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,208
And what's worse, the
voices of his family.

34
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,208
But Ninja Slayer stood firm.

35
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,125
He forced his way
through the exit

36
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,625
and headed towards
the fifth room.

37
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,750
[HELLKITE]
Domo, Ninja Slayer-san!

38
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,791
I'm the one called Hellkite!

39
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,250
Domo, Hellkite-san.

40
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,833
I'm the one called Ninja Slayer.

41
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,250
[NINJA SLAYER yells]

42
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,708
It's game over,
Ninja Slayer-san!

43
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,625
This room was
custom built for me

44
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,166
to perform my
hellish kite-jitsu.

45
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,666
[NARRATOR]
The giant fans everywhere

46
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,416
were operated by Hellkite-san's
remote IRC! Oh my Buddha!

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,166
[HELLKITE yells]

48

00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,250
You will never
escape this place!

[HELLKITE yells]

53
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,750
Hurts doesn't it?

54
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,791
That is what the power of a
true Six Gates Ninja feels like!

55
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,458
I told you this was game
over, Ninja Slayer-san!

56
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,791
[HELLKITE yells]

57
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,916
Aw, no way!

58
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,166
[HELLKITE] You got me that time,
but that's all you're gonna get!

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,416
From now on, I'm going to have

60
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,000
to keep hitting you
from a safe distance!

61
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,375
[HELLKITE yells]

62
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,625
[HELLKITE]
What's wrong, Ninja Slayer-san?

63
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:30,541
Are you sad because your
sensei isn't here to help you?

64
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,375
Better watch your step!

65
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,875
[NINJA SLAYER screams]

66
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,583
[HELLKITE] Allow me to
behead you, Ninja Slayer-san!

67
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,250
What in the hell?

68
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,250
[HELLKITE]
Hey! I didn't turn on that fan!

69
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,708
[yelling]

70
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,916
[growling]

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
[HELLKITE]
I almost have you!

72
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,333
All hail Laomoto-san, banzai!

73
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,791
[NINJA SLAYER]
You can not win, Hellkite-san!

74
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,750
Recite your death haiku!

75
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,833
I told you! As long
as I'm in this room--

76
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:06,875
What?

77
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,041
[NARRATOR]
Nancy-san hacked into

78
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,291
Tokorozawa Pillar's
computer space.

79
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,583
She owns this room!

80
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,291
[HELLKITE]
She hacked in?

81
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,541
[HELLKITE groaning]

82
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,708
I've gotta hurry up and
report this to Laomoto-san.

83
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,000
He's almost to the top floor.

84
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,375
[GATEKEEPER]
Domo, Ninja Slayer-san.

85
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,791
I am the one they
call Gatekeeper.

86
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,583
Domo, Gatekeeper-san.

87
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,333
I am Ninja Slayer.

88
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,291
You may guard the sixth gate,

89
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,666
but death is the only
way out for ninjas.

90
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,333
[GATEKEEPER]
It's a shame.

91
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:07,375
I never dreamed I would have to
dirty my hands with this mess.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,250
[GATEKEEPER] You have struck
down gate after gate.

93
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,583
Each one has been
a blow to my heart.

94
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,166
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll be seeing them again

95
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,875
when all of you
regroup down in hell.

96
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,291
[GATEKEEPER] The grief
I feel is truly profound.

97
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,375
And the fact that it's
been caused by some fool

98
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,750
on a pointless
quest for vengeance

99
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,166
makes matters far worse.

100
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,791
It pains me to think
that I'm involved--

101
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,458
[NINJA SLAYER] It seems to
me you're suffering from

102
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:33,708
emotional diarrhea of
the mouth, Gatekeeper-san.

103
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,125
[GATEKEEPER] I thought
I'd gotten past having

104
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,375
to participate in this
kind of mindless violence

105
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,541
for the most part.

106
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,291
Do you even realize
what you're saying?

107
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,541
You've aligned yourself
with cold-blooded murderers.

108
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,291
They've murdered my wife,
my child, and my sensei,

109
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:50,041
so please spare me all your
ridiculous crocodile tears.

110
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,250
Enemy ninja, death
is the only way out!

111
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,041
[GATEKEEPER]
The ravings of a lunatic.

112
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,125
I believe Miyamoto Musashi said,
"Dead men tell no tales."

113
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,291
But if you insist,
I suppose I must engage.

114

115
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,500
[GATEKEEPER]
Come on!

116
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,333
Show me what you can
do with your Karate!

[NINJA SLAYER yelling]

118
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,208
[GATEKEEPER] Although you've
sustained a great deal of damage

119
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,458
to your body, your skills
are still respectable.

120
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,458
But how long can you keep it up?

121
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,875
[GATEKEEPER] It seems
you're becoming desperate.

122
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,708
Is it because I'm
still unharmed?

123
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:40,541
[BOTH yelling]

124
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,416
[GATEKEEPER] Your suriken
will not penetrate my Tonfa!

125
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,666
[NARRATOR]
Look at that timing!

126
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,916
The aptly named Gatekeeper
is a true master

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,083
of the spin and
thrust Tonfa method!

[GATEKEEPER sreaming]

132
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,500
[GATEKEEPER]
I underestimated your karate.

133
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,666
I thought it would be good,
but not this good.

134
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,333
[NINJA SLAYER]
Hm.

135
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,875
[GATEKEEPER]
I know what you're thinking.

136
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,208
You intend to finish me
with your next strike.

137
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,083
That's not a bad idea.

Abbah. You're quite skilled.

But you don't have a chance
of defeating Laomoto-san.

146
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,166
You'll die on your knees
begging for your life. Like a--

Oh, Laomoto-san.

It's not trickery.

00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,625
This is what you've sown.

It's your fault, daddy.

Your vengeance is meaningless.

No matter what you do, you'll

After all, you and I
have never met until now.

00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,666
I went against the boss
and paid dearly for it.

175
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,666
He doesn't take assassination
attempts lightly.

176
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,125
I brought it upon myself.

177
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,666
But who am I?

178
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,083
[MORBID laughing]

179
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,583
[NINJA SLAYER]
I can't stray from my plan.

180
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:41,750
Furinkazan, chado,
and then, Furinkazan.

181
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,708
I never imagined you'd
fail me so completely.

182
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,041
Silence! You're not real!

183
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:52,500
I'm doing everything exactly
as my real sensei instructed.

184
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,166
You have no power here!

185
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,125
[screaming]

186
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,708
[FUYUKO]
It's all your fault, dear.

187
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,166
[TOCHINOKI]
Daddy.

188
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,375
[TOCHINOKI]
Daddy.

189
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,166
[FUYUKO]
Sweetie.

190
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,083
[NINJA SLAYER]
Fuyuko. Tochinoki.

191
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:27,250
[MORBID screaming]

192
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,208
[ding]

193
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,000
[ELECTRONIC VOICE]
You have arrived.

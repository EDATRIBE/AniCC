Finish him!

[NARAKU]
You need me, Fujikido.

6
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,291
You've got the body,
I've got the power.

7
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,916
[NINJA SLAYER
Silence, Naraku!

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,916
[NARAKU] You can't win this.
If you weren't so weak,

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,500
he'd be a red smudge
in the dirt by now!

10
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,083
[NINJA SLAYER] For the last
time, this is my vengeance.

11
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,375
I will slay this
ninja. On my own!

12
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,583

22
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,833
[NARRATOR] Their karates
are symmetrically opposed.

23
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:53,916
One strikes with great force.
The other, with great speed.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,625
Neither has a clear advantage.

25
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,083
[LAOMOTO growling]

26
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,500
This is boring!

27
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,958
[YAKUZA CLONE]
Laomoto-san.

28
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,375
You have another televised
press conference to attend.

29
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,958
[LAOMOTO growls]
End this Dark-ninja-san!

30
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,000
I have constituents to deceive!

00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,708
[LAOMOTO]
Make him bleed from his eyes!

32
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,541
From his-- where-ever!

33
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,666
[DARKNINJA]
Having performance issues,

34
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,333
Ninja Slayer-san?

35
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,041
You aren't using the
power of your ninja soul.

36
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,875
Too weak to get it up
without your sensei?

37
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,208
[NINJA SLAYER]
Tell me this.

38
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,250
Is my ninja soul unable
to rise to this occasion?

39
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,625
Or are you too weak
to stimulate it?

40
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,791
[NARRATOR] Between blows,
our combatants trade barbs

41
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,791
with provocative Zen dialogue.

42
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,375
[NINJA SLAYER] Perhaps you
should draw your katana,

43
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,916
Darkninja-san.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,708
Although faint, I can still
sense the ninja soul within it.

45
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,583
It's not still broken, is it?

46
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,708
[DARKNINJA] I'll not use
Beppin on the likes of you.

47
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,000
Your feeble blood
might make her limp.

You misjudge me.

[NINJA SLAYER yells]

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,541
[NARRATOR] Though Ninja
Slayer charges faster

61
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,541
than a speeding
bullet train, for him,

62
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,875
his movements seem slow.
As does the world around him.

63
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:24,000
It's the neuron

[NINJA SLAYER]
Wasshoi!

00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,291
[DARKNINJA]
Kirisute gomen!

69
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,875
[NINJA SLAYER]
Not this time.

[NINJA SLAYER groans]

71
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,125
[DARKNINJA] That was too much
to ask, even of Beppin.

72
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,666
Yet I have no choice but to use
her if I'm to settle this feud.

73
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,791
[TORTOISE]
Darkninja-san.

74
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,375
Consider the wants and
needs of your Beppin.

75
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,083
[CRANE]
Darkninja-san.

76
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,625
It's time for you to pledge
your fealty to a new master.

77
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,666
[TORTOISE]
Domo. I am Master Tortoise.

78
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,958
I can look into the future,
but not very far, mind you.

79
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,750
[CRANE]
Domo, I am Master Crane.

80
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:22,208
I can see into the past,
but not that far back, either.

00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:26,416
[NINJA SLAYER grunts]
Are they Soukai ninjas as well?

82
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,416
[NARRATOR] Darkninja was
strong enough alone.

83
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Ninja Slayer did not look
forward to fighting him

84
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,333
and two more.

85
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,375
[NINJA SLAYER]
But still.

We will dispatch this pest!

[CRANE]
Thunder Forge-san is in Kyoto.

97
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,833
It perplexes us that
you've not sought

98
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,541
his assistance as instructed.

99
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,541
[DARKNINJA]
Kyoto is currently controlled by

100
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,416
the Zaibatsu Shadow Guild.
Moreover, I'm on a mission.

101
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,833
A mission entrusted
to me by Laomoto-san.

102
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,958
[TORTOISE]
Compared to the task destiny

has set before you,
your mission...

104
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,916
[NINJA SLAYER]
Death is...

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,958
[CRANE]
You must locate...

106
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,000
[NINJA SLAYER]
...the only way out.

107
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,250
[DARKNINJA]
The Imperial Regalia.

108
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,416
I need a sword,
a jewel, and a mirror?

109
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
[TORTOISE]
No.

110
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,416
Those things are
obviously make-believe.

111
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,458
[DARKNINJA]
Then what treasures do I seek?

112
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:45,000
[CRANE] The mask, the
nunchaku, and the bracer.

113
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,583
[GENDOSO]
Ninja Slayer-san.

114
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,416
I know you miss me,
but stop almost dying!

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,083
[NINJA SLAYER]
Roshi Dragon-sensei-san.

116
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,166
I was such a fool. So arrogant.

117
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,000
I squandered all of your
training and counsel.

118
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,416
[GENDOSO]
Well, don't screw this one up.

119
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,708
Furin-Kazan. Chado.
Keep going. Furin-Kazan.

[DARKNINJA]
Kyoto. Zaibatsu.

Katsu Wanso. Nunja.

[NINJA SLAYER] Dragon-sensei.
You've saved my life again.

128

What is this?

00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,500
Found another pathetic excuse
for running away, have you?

132
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,125
This score is anything
but settled, Darkninja-san.

133
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,708
[DARKNINJA]
You survived? How shocking.

134
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,916
Stand aside.

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,041
My "destiny" will have to wait.

136
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,833
This fight has needed
to end for a long time.

00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:18,083
[DARKNINJA] Ninja Slayer's life
is mine, and mine alone.

[TORTOISE]
You're mistaken, Darkninja-san.

139
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,208
Destiny doesn't wait!

140
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,375
[CRANE] Also, if you
slay an unhallowed man,

141
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,791
he'll taint your hand
with unworthy blood.

142
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,416
[CRANE, TORTOISE]
And your hand is precious.

[NINJA SLAYER]
Huh?

[NINJA SLAYER]
This does not mean failure.

151
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,958
I will corner him
again before long.

152
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:08,458
In preparation for that day,
I must slay Laomoto Khan.

153
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,000
And find Nancy-san.

Other than that,
I'm pretty much fine.

[NARRATOR] Chado assassination
techniques consume

00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,083
a fair number of calories.

168
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,583
The corresponding acceleration

169
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,958
of one's metabolic
processes creates a need

00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,125
for high quality,
nutritional replenishment.

171
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,500
--[door scrapes]
--[NINJA SLAYER, NANCY] Hm?

172
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,416
What're you doing in here?

173
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,583
You've got some nerve,
breaking into my room.

174
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,916
Do you know who I am?

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,083
What I can do to you?

176
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,375
[NINJA SLAYER]
Let's go.

177
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:01,416
[laughs] Good idea,
and you'd better run fast.

178
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,166
Because sooner or later,
I'll get you for this.

179
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,166
Hey! You can't take her,
she's mine! Mine!

180
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,541
I'll call Fujio!

181
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,750
I'll make him kill you! I swear!

182
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,791
[NINJA SLAYER]
Who was that boy?

183
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,916
[NANCY] Laomoto-san's son.
Or one of them at least.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,833
There were way more
than I could count.

185
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,625
[NINJA SLAYER]
I see.

186
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,458
Can you make it
out of here alone?

187
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,750
[NANCY] There's a computer
room pretty close to here.

188
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,375
If you can get me that
far, I should be fine.

189
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,083
And if the mission's still on,
then I'll stay and support you.

190
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,750
Once I'm hacked in,
I'll do my best

191
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:37,416
to get you into the keep.
I owe you at least that much.

192
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,750
[NANCY]
Also...

193
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,375
If I hacked into that,
I could make the race

194
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,125
for governor a lot
more interesting.

195
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,000
After all, I have
proof of nearly

196
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,000
every crime his
syndicate's committed.

197
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,833
Locked in to my own
neural hard-drive.

198
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,958
If I can plug it in, well...

170
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,416
[NANCY] All I have to do
is write "tanuki."

171
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,375
But for some reason,
I just can't do it!

172
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,250
[NANCY] It's like
my hand's frozen!

173
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,875
[ELECTRONIC VOICE]
30 seconds remaining.

174
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:42,625
[gasps]

175
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,500
[bells chime]

176
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,416
[bells chime]

177
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,250
[NANCY]
Jose-san? Is that you?

178
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,458
[NANCY]
"Speak naught of the past."

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,416
Arigato. My doubts
have been cleared away.

180
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,583
[gasps]
That's right, cleared away!

181
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,458
[gasps]

182
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,000
[NINJA SLAYER]
Excellent work, Nancy-san.

183
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,500
[NANCY]
I didn't do it by myself.

184
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:57,250
Taragi-san helped me.
And you. And him.

185
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,833
Jose-san.

186
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,750
Jose-san?

187
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,458
Never mind that.

188
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,958
It must've been a hallucination
or something I had.

189
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,875
All those drugs and electricity.

190
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,458
[NINJA SLAYER] To think she has
the drive to go further

191
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,541
than her body can take her.

192
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,000
She can't be the only
person in my life like this.

193
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,458
This world is
rotten and hellish.

194
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,041
But could there be more to
seek in it than vengeance?

195
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,250
At this moment,
my goals are pure.

196
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,916
Help Nancy-san and
Dragon-sensei. That's all.

197
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,208
[NINJA SLAYER]
Wasshoi!

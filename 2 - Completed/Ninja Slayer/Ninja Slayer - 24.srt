00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,166
[LAOMOTO]
Damn you, Hellkite-san!

3
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,791
Why didn't you report
this to me sooner?

4
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,833
How dare you embarrass me
with your incompetence!

5
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,291
Unacceptable!

6
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,333
Huh?

7
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,708
[LAOMOTO] He's moved through
the gates this quickly?

8
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,791
[yelping]

9
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,166
It looks like even
Gatekeeper-san has fallen!

[HELLKITE grunts]

11
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,708
Politics can wait.

12
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,250
Ninja Slayer-san is a
plague on the syndicate.

13
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,833
He must be eradicated at once.

14
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,875
Cover me on my way
out of the castle keep.

15
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,958
Fail me this time and it
will be your last mistake.

16
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,041
[HELLKITE]
Yes, sir! I understand!

17
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,833
[ELECTRONIC VOICE]
Attention! Attention!

18
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,750
Ninja Slayer-san has seized
70% of the castle keep.

19
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,333
Where is Nancy-san?

20
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,458
[ELECTRONIC VOICE] Currently,
she is in an offline domain.

21
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,500
I'm sorry, but this is
as far as I can take you.

22
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,166
[ELECTRONIC VOICE]
Go right ahead.

23
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,791
[ELECTRONIC VOICE]
You have arrived.

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,125
Oh, look.

25
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,583
Hey, big boy.

26
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,166
[GREEN OIRAN]
You wanna play with us?

27
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,750
[NINJA SLAYER]
Domo, Laomoto-san.

28
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,083
I am Ninja Slayer.

29
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,958
[LAOMOTO laughing]

30
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,583
[LAOMOTO]
Domo to you, Ninja Slayer-san.

31
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,708
I must say that the
amount of disruption

32
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,791
you've left in your wake
is very impressive.

33
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,541
You are quite an ambitious
little rat, aren't you?

34
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,000
[NINJA SLAYER]
But if that little rat

35
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,791
bites a lion just once, the
king of the jungle can die

36
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,041
from anaphylactic shock.

37
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,416
[NARRATOR]
Wow! What a poet!

38
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,625
Can you believe how Ninja
Slayer expertly fused

39
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,416
metaphor with modern
medical science?

40
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,958
So you crawled out of the sewer
and into the lion's den.

41
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,250
Such a foolish endeavor.

42
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,541
What drove you
to take this risk?

43
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,125
[NINJA SLAYER]
You murdered my wife and child.

44
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,541
You stepped on my family

45
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,916
like we were insignificant
worms, weak and helpless.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,041
What you failed to realize
is you didn't step on a worm,

47
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,125
you stepped on a cobra
with deadly fangs!

48
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,083
That so?

49
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,250
It won't matter in the least

50
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,458
if you can't get within
striking distance.

51
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,916
[BLUE OIRAN]
Oh my.

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,083

00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,083
[GREEN OIRAN]
He is so worked up.

54
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,375
[PURPLE OIRAN] I think he's
just about ready to explode.

55
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,375
[RED OIRAN]
What a bad boy.

56
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,708
[NARRATOR]
Oh, Buddha! A honey trap?

57
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,708
Who saw that one coming?

Eat this!

Hm?

[SPIDER]
Sayonara!

67
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,791
[NINJA SLAYER]
Tell me,

68
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,000
am I in "striking distance"
now, Laomoto-san?

69
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:51,125
[LAOMOTO] I suppose you
are, Ninja Slayer-san.

70
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,291
But first, let me tell you
something about myself.

71
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:01,000
There are seven ninja souls
dwelling inside of me.

72
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,083
Seven of them.

73
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,541
That makes me the most powerful
ninja the world has ever known.

74
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,291
No man, living or
dead could beat me.

75
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,500
You may wonder,
"If that's the case,

76
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,791
then why does Laomoto-san
have so many traps

77
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,625
and ninjas surrounding him?"

78
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,500
Do you want to know why?

79
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,375
Because you waste my time!

80
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,166
Do you understand what each
second of my day is worth?

81
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,041
Instead of playing
silly games with you,

82
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,625
I could be making billions.

83
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,291
My time is the most precious
commodity on the planet

84
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,833
and you've made me squander it!

85
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,750
The Six Gates were
put in place to ensure

86
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,541
that I don't have to deal
with this kind of headache.

87
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,333
[NINJA SLAYER]
But now, your precious Six Gates

88
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,916
have been torn wide open.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,791
This so-called "headache" should
be the least of your worries.

90
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,250
What you should be
more concerned about

91
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,291
is keeping your head
attached to your body.

92
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,083
But once I remove it, you won't
have a care in the world.

93
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,750
Because you'll be dead!

94
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,500
[LAOMOTO laughing]

95
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,416
[LAOMOTO] This conversation
is going nowhere.

96
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,541
But I suppose a rat like
you could never dream

97
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,375
of understanding the
thoughts of an eagle.

98
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,041
Did you not hear me before?

99
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,666
I'm an unstoppable
force of nature.

100
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,083
The most powerful ninja
the world has ever known.

101
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,333
I will have to show
you what I mean

102
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,125
as I end your pathetic life.

103
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,000
[NARRATOR]
Gouranga!

104
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,375
What an incredibly frightening
display of psychokinesis!

[laughing]

107
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,166
[LAOMOTO]
Now strike, Ninja Slayer-san.

108
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,041
I can end your suffering.
You can see your wife and child.

109
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,250
I'll send you across the Sonzu
River to be with them in Hell!

[LAOMOTO laughing]

116
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,458
[LAOMOTO] How boring. Has
the cobra lost its fangs?

117
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,291
[laughing]

118
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,791

Arrogance beget by ignorance!

[LAOMOTO yells]

121
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,250
This is the fate that
befalls all of those

122
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,458
who are foolish
enough to defy me.

123
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,291
Now recite your death haiku,
Ninja Slayer-san.

124
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,208
[NINJA SLAYER]
I refuse. I refuse!

125
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,916
[LAOMOTO laughing]

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,125
You're a joke that's
run its course.

127
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,916
You call yourself Ninja Slayer,
yet you squirm under my boot.

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,958
Ha!

129
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,791
[NINJA SLAYER]
I will slay you. Ah!

130
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,875
I am the one true ninja.

131
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,750
The one who's
mastered the jeetsu

132
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,583
to control seven ninja souls.

133
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,916
I have no equal in this world.

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,125
In time, I will be worshipped.

135
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,250
I am more than a ninja.

136
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,291
I am a god!

137
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,583
[NINJA SLAYER]
Death is the only way out...

138
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,583
...for ninjas.

139
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,250
Perhaps I should start by
dismembering you alive.

140
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:51,375
Stop, Fujikido. I won't have it.

141
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,625
Fujikido, stop now!

142
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:56,750
[LAOMOTO]
Huh?

143
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,708
Is this a runaway ninja soul?

144
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,541
Death is the only
way out for ninjas.

145
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,875
Death is the only
way out for ninjas!

146
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,458
So die!

[yelling]

149
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,083
You may have murdered
my wife and child,

150
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,250
but you will not
murder me today.

151
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,250
Today, you will be
murdered, Laomoto-san!

152
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,041
[NINJA SLAYER yelling]

153
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,000
[laughing]

154
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,875
It seems the room cannot
contain my power.

155
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,625
Come up here if you
dare, Ninja Slayer-san.

156
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,041
[NINJA SLAYER yelling]

157
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,041
[NARRATOR]
These foul, evil, black flames

158
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,500
were a telltale sign
of Naraku's presence.

159
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,083
But since Fujikido still
had control of his own body,

160
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,708
how was this possible?

161
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,708
The answer was
simple, yet elegant.

162
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,083
Ninja Slayer was
consuming the ninja soul,

163
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,750
using it like fuel to feed
his appetite for vengeance!

164
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,458
Huh? Such ferocity.

165
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,083

[HELLKITE yells]

167
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,291
[LAOMOTO]
It's still not enough.

168
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,875
[LAOMOTO]
Out of steam so soon?

169
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,625
[LAOMOTO, HELLKITE laughing]

[NINJA SLAYER yells]

171
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,291
[LAOMOTO]
You may think this is unfair,

172
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,083
but combat and business
are one and the same.

173
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:42,041
You either take the advantage,
or you suffer the loss.

174
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,541
Now die, Ninja Slayer-san!

175
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,000
The only way out...

176
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,333

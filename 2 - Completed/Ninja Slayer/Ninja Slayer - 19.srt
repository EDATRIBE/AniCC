Guessed his password

Suffice it to say,
we know about your plan.

48
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,625
No need to worry,
we're basically gonna keep it.

With several minor modifications

What the hell is he getting at?

But the part of your little
plot we're definitely keeping,

52
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,625
is the bit where our bosses
say their sayonaras.

53
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,166
But I think we'll let your
friend say his as well.

54

Does this mean that these guys

aren't with the Soukaiya?

56
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,041
Now, we're still
with the Soukaiya.

57
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,458
It's just due for a change.

58
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,250
Admittedly our bosses are
strong and clever leaders.

59
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,416
But mucking around a few
days ago, I had this idea.

60
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,250
My ninja soul is
very ambitious.

61
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,666
So I figured life would
much be more palatable

62
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,541
if I took control of
the whole syndicate.

63
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:30,250
Think you meant to say "we."
You and I will take control.

64
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,916
Well of course
that's what I meant.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,250
The mortality rate for a Six
Gates Ninja is higher than ever.

66
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,958
Without them, this syndicate
lacks stability.

67
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,666
I need your help to control

Then kill the boss

00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:07,791
Huh?

174
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,875
[ALBATROSS]
Yeeart!

175
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,916
Domo Ninja Slayer-san.
I am Albatross.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,333
[ALBATROSS, NINJA SLAYER yell]

177
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,416
[NARRATOR] A one-sided
greeting is also pretty rude!

178
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,041
[BEEHIVE]
I'm not out of bullets yet!

179
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,375
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart! Yeeart!

180
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,458
[TEN COUNT]
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

181
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,375
[NINJA SLAYER] shouts]

182
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,583
[TEN COUNT yells]

183
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,625
[NINJA SLAYER shouts]

184
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,458
[ALBATROSS]
Yeeart! Yeeart! Yeeart!

185
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,708
--[BEEHIVE shouts]
--[NINJA SLAYER yells]

186
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,458
[NINJA SLAYER]
What the--?

187
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,583
[WIRED] Metal is useless
against my Magne-jitsu!

188
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,541
[NINJA SLAYER gasps]

189
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,041
[ALBATROSS, BEEHIVE laugh]

190
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:40,583
[WIRED, TEN COUNT laugh]

191
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,791
[TEN COUNT] HUH?

192
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,583
[ALBATROSS] HUH?

193
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,250
--[NINJA SLAYER shouts]
--[ALL] Huh?

194
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,958
[NINJA SLAYER yells]

195
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,083
He's getting away!
Hunt him down, men!

196
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,125
Let's get him!

197
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,125
[ALBATROSS yells]

198
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,291
[BEEHIVE]
We'll tear him apart!

199
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,541
[WIRED, TEN COUNT]
Yeah!

200
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,416
Where are you? Where'd you go?

201
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,666
Come on out! Let's do this!

202
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,125
[NINJA SLAYER] How did they
find out about my plan

203
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,666
to assassinate Laomoto?

204
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,791
Did Nancy-san betray me?

205
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:09,000
Out you rat! Come face me!
Come on out you coward!

206
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:13,791
No. She'd never give me up.
Never let me down. Or hurt me.

207
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,750
Show yourself!
You can't hide forever!

208
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,583
So it seems if
I'm to find out,

209
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,666
I must show these thugs
how a true ninja fights.

210
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,000
[BEEHIVE] Aieee!
It's Ninja Slayer-san!

211
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,041
Help! Gwah!

212
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,500
[ALBATROSS]
Wonder if things went as bad

213
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,375
for the four we sent
after Darkninja-san

214
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,625
as they did for us.

215
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,083
I couldn't see anything,
but I heard the screams.

216
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,750
Chances are I'm the last
ninja left, aside from--

217
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,791
[NINJA SLAYER]
Domo. I am Ninja Slayer.

218
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,041
[ALBATROSS shouts]

219
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,458
[ALBATROSS]
Domo. I am Albatross.

220
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,958
How did you find me?!

221
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,041
[NINJA SLAYER]
Situational awareness.

222
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,250
I can't beat him. He'll slay me.

223
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,666
But I'll be damned if I
can't get a shot off first!

224
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,666
[ALBATROSS yells]

225
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,041
[yells]

226
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,458
[ALBATROSS]
Aieee!

227
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:12,125
--[NINJA SLAYER yells]
--[ALBATROSS screams, grunts]

228
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,416
[ALBATROSS whimpers]
Aieee...

229
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,458
I have some questions for you.

230
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:30,625
[ALBATROSS screams]

1
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:45,250
[NARRATOR] Kagi Tanaka and
Yamoto Koki met by chance.

2
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,916
The man, AKA ninja
Silver Karasu,

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,458
is getting out of
the killing business

4
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:53,208
to spend his final days teaching
karate to the young ninja.

5
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,166
However, what fate
has bought together,

6
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,500
the Soukaiya threatens
to tear apart.

7
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:01,625
Silver Karasu has just received
orders to assassinate his pupil.

8
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,250
Let's be clear.
This isn't about you.

9
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,125
I'm selfish. So I'm
teaching you because

10
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,291
that's what I wanna do, got it?

11
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,416
[YAMOTO]
Mm-hmm.

12
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,875
[KAGI]
I don't have a lot of time,

13
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,500
so this is gonna be kinda
"crash course" style.

14
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll have to learn
more on your own.

15
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,250
[YAMOTO] Mm-hmm.

16
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,666
[KAGI] Iaido is ultimate
control of the katana.

17
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,500
Focus all your energy,
all your karate into your blade.

18
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,416
It can't be separate from you.

19
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,958
To "be the blade,"
is the true goal of Iaido.

20
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,083
[YAMOTO]
Mm-hmm.

21
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,666
[KAGI] If the So-kaiya
is on your tail,

22
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,208
they've already got their
next goon on the hunt.

23
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,291
They'll find you. And it's
gonna be sooner than later.

24
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:39,000
Trust me on this one.
They will not be alone.

25
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,583
So I wanna skip ahead
to the final skill.

26
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,625
It's more of a Zen method.

27
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,791
I've only used it
a few times myself.

28
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,625
You're gonna be
fighting your battles alone,

29
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:51,083
so pay attention and remember
everything about this technique.

30
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,166
How it feels.

31
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,541
C'mon, enough cryin' okay?

32
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,750
[MALE TV VOICE A] You're on top
of the world and then boom!

33
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,375
--Life hands ya a turd sandwich!
--[MALE TV VOICE 14B] Ew, gross!

34
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,125
[AUDIENCE, YAMOTO laugh]

35
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,458
So. Ya thought about
your next move?

36
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,166
Running off to
Kyoto or someplace

37
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,583
with more sunshine
might be good for ya.

38
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,000
And if you leave Neo-Saitama,

39
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,375
the Soukaiya might
just forget about ya.

40
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,291
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

41
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,541
[KAGI]
I bet if you looked, you--

42
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,541
[KAGI coughs]

43
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,500
Kagi-san!

44
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,708
[KAGI]
Ah.

45
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,833
Buddha. Damn it.

46
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,250
[phone rings]

47
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,416
[whimpers]

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,541
[KAGI] You should
probably bail, ya hear?

49
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,375
You can find a place?

50
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,958
[YAMOTO]
Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,750
[KAGI]
Take care.

52
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,000
[YAMOTO]
Take care.

53
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,291
[YAMOTO]
Thank you.

54
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,208
[KAGI]
I'm counting on you.

55
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,625
[KAGI] Well, better get
ready for company.

56
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,916
[NARRATOR]
The Soukaiya Ninja, Third Eye,

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,541
is a skilled tracker who can
see the traces of ninja souls.

58
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,583
Whereas the bounty
hunter Sword Dancer

59
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,916
is a ninja proficient in
a deadly two-sword style.

60
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,875
From this point
it seems as though

61
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,458
the target ninja soul's
tracks split into two.

62
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,791
[Can you tell which
set of tracks is newer?

63
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,875
Sorry. But that's impossible,
even for me.

64
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,041
[NARRATOR] Nuh-uh. He's lying
through his fearsome ninja mask.

65
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,125
[THIRD EYE] So that means
you and I need to split up.

66
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,583
I'll look around
in this direction,

67
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,541
and you go and look in that one.

68
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,125
[SWORD DANCER]
All right then.

69
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,458
Do you know where we're supposed
to meet up with Silver Karasu?

70
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,791
[THIRD EYE] He never responded
to the message, so no.

71
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,583
I bet he's planning on taking
the prize all for himself1

72
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,958
What a complete moron!

73
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,083
I mean, we're just
looking for a little girl.

74
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,916
Honestly, I'd be more than
happy to cut him out of it.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,791
Now let's go!

76
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,583
[SWORD DANCER]
Hmph.

77
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,791
[THIRD EYE]
All right, you dog.

78
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,458
You can go chasing your
tail all over town.

79
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,500
The ninja soul left
the run-down dojo

80
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,833
and continued on this street.

81
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,250
Then it looks like she
and her partner

82
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,458
went to their secret hideout.

83
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,625
Whoever that is, is there now.

84
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,208
It's probably Ninja Slayer,

85
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,208
the maniac that
killed the six gates.

86
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,458
Definitely do not want
to run into that guy!

87
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,500
I'll let Sword Dancer find out
what's behind door number one.

88
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,875
The little ninja
bitch is all mine!

89
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,291
[YAMOTO]
Domo.

90
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,125
I am Yamoto Koki.

[SWORD DANCER]
Domo, Silver Karasu-san.

99
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,708
Have you gone insane?!

100
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,750
[SILVER KARASU]
Batshit.

101
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,291
You don't have a
smoke on ya, do ya?

102
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,208
A "Somewhat Bright Sea" brand?

103
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,958
It's a long shot.

104
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,583
Cause ya don't
seem like the type.

105
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,833
I'll still check
your corpse, though.

Third Eye-san!

107

IRC won't work. Sorry pal.

109
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,125
I mixed in some chaff
with the dynamite earlier.

110
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,750
[SWORD DANCER] Why are you
doing this, Silver Karasu?

111
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,208
I found out I'm dying.
So I went a little crazy.

112
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,708
[SWORD DANCER]
Oh, you're gonna die, freak.

113
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,458

two-sword style
karate I've ever seen!

121
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,000
Silver Karasu's Katana
is called 'Ubaste'

122
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,291
referring to the
practice of leaving

123
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,291
a poor old person
somewhere to die.

124
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,541

that old, but he'll do!

No. I won't. I... Hate poetry.

style would beat you.

You still have to obey

infinitely more awesome!

00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,250
[SILVER KARASU] Shouldn't
rush a sick man, ya know?

176
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,375
Domo. Nice to meet you.

177
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,416
I'm Yamoto Koki.

178
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,583
Domo, Yamoto Koki-san.

179
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,416
I'm Silver Karasu.

180
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,000
[sighs]

181
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,875
Show me what you know.

182
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,541
I'd love to see it.

183
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,916
[SILVER KARASU] Not that I
really deserve to, mind you.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,916
I mean, I've pretty much
just used my ninja skills

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
to kill poor dumb bastards
for a little coin.

186
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,666
I have no real honor or worth.

187
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,208
[SILVER KARASU]
Come on.

188
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,416
You know that was pointless.

189
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,458
Yeah, that's more like it.

190
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,833
Show me what you can
do with that blade.

191
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,083
[YAMOTO yells]

192
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,083
[YAMOTO gasps, yells]

193
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,416
[grunts]

[sobs]

197
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,208
[SILVER KARASU]
Buddha.

198
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,625
I've never fought someone
who cried so much.

199
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,083
[yells]

200
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:47,125
[YAMOTO yelling, sobbing]

201
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,958
You're gonna break it.

202
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,958
[yells]

203
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,208
[SILVER KARASU]
Please.

204
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,541
Would ya just...

205
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,791
...stop the waterworks and
close the deal already?

206
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,625
This is my moment here.

207
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,666
[SILVER KARASU]
My last fight.

208
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,708
[YAMOTO sobs]

209
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,083
I'm trying to teach
ya something here,

210
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,500
but it doesn't work
if ya know it's me.

211
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,750
Ya gotta learn how to kill.

212
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,083
But I could never kill you!

213
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,125
I'm not an idiot Kagi-san.

214
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,250
I knew it was you
from the start!

215
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,083
I can't do it!

216
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,208
[SILVER KARASU]
Are you sure?

217
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,375
[YAMOTO sobs]
Yes.

218
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,375
[SILVER KARASU]
Okay.

219
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,916
I should've known this
wouldn't tie up so neatly.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,916
You're still a kid after all.

221
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,250
[SILVER KARASU] I can't even
bum my last smoke from you.

222
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,625
[SILVER KARASU] Like they
say... karma's a bitch.

223
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,458
Ha. Ha. I guess that's
my only true regret.

224
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,250
[SILVER KARASU]
Now all that's left...

225
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:09,583
...is to slip into the long
sleep, and go to hell in peace.

226
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,125
[ELECTRONIC GEISHA VOICE]
Attention. Attention.

227
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,625
Please be aware that the
train is coming through.

228
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,000
We must make abundantly
clear that being hit by it

229
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,875
will be extremely inconvenient,
to say the least.

230

172
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,541
you would have never fallen
victim to that lowly ninja.

173
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,458
That crane fly!

174
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,791
[NINJA SLAYER] Silence.
You are just a ghost!

175
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,250
I swear I will do it!

176
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,166
[NARAKU]
Do what, exactly? Tell me!

177
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,875
[NINJA SLAYER]
I will kill the ninja!

178
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,500
[NARAKU] But there's only
one way that can happen!

179
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,208
[NARAKU, NINJA SLAYER]
Death is the only way out

180
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,208
for ninjas!

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,625
[NARAKU] I will have to
kill the ninja myself!

182
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,125
Let me show you how it is done!

183
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,666
[CLOUD BUSTER]
Huh? No! That's impossible!

184
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,875
I killed him with my own hands!

185
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,666
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[CLOUD BUSTER] Aaaargh!

186
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:36,166
[CLOUD BUSTER]
Uuh? Industry!

187
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,375
What the--? Your body
should be convulsing

188
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,541
from the shock of
a billion volts right now!

189
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,041
You're just a toy robot!

190
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,750
[NARRATOR] His eyes
burn like sparklers,

191
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,041
leaving an afterimage in the
darkness of the witching hour.

192
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,375
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[CLOUD BUSTER] Augh!

193
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,125
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

194
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:58,291
[CLOUD BUSTER]
Aaaargh!

195
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,208
Aaaargh!

196
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,500
[KINJIMA]
Huh? Aieee!

197
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:09,291
[CLOUD BUSTER]
Aaaargh! Sayonara!

198
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,791
[NINJA SLAYER]
Wasshoi!

199
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,208
You're nothing but a tiny man
with a flying piece of garbage!

200
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,625
Your meager, pitiful karate
cannot help you now!

201
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,541
[KINJIMA]
Aieee!

202
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,500
[COURTESANS scream]

203
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,000
[LAOMOTO]
Yeeart!

204
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:39,208
[LAOMOTO]
Damn you. Ninja Slayer!

205
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,458
[SMITH] Hmm. Thought I
smelled some money.

206
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,916
But this dude's busted.

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,375
He's got somethin'
on him though.

208
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,791
Aieee!

209
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,291
Where am I?
Tell me where I am!

210
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,500
Just calm down, man.
You're in Old Tokyo Bay!

211
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,208
I want you to take me to a
back-alley doctor right away!

212
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,083
Right!

213
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,916
You guys take care
of things for a while.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,250
I'll explain everything later!

215
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,125
[MAN 02A, 02B gasp]

216
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,291
[SMITH] That's it!
I'm outta the game!

217
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,416
I knew karma would bite me
in the ass sooner or later!

218
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,583
No more dealin' Men-tai!

219
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll drop this dude off
at the doctor,

220
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,416
give all my money
to a drug rehab,

221
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,833
and take my ass to Kyoto!

222
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,541
I'll become a Buddhist monk
and pray every day

223
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,750
I never come across
another ninja in my life!

224
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,791
I'm gonna be a new man,
I promise!

225
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,166
[NARRATOR] Smith has a severe
case of Ninja Reality Shock,

226
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,500
which creates a feedback loop
of fear and repentance.

227
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,875
He guns his jet-ski,
carrying the Grim Reaper

228
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,500
of ninjas back to the city.

229
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,708
[SMITH]
Ain't karma a bitch!

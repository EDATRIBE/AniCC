00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,750
[YAMOTO]
She needs my help.

4
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,375
[YAMOTO] I have to
save her. But how?

5
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,791
[PUNK 03B chuckles]

6
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,833
[YAMOTO]
First I have to save myself.

7
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,791
If they kill me,
it's over for both of us.

8
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,416
But there's nothing I can do.

9
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,125
[SHI NINJA]
Have some faith, child.

10
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,541
You can save yourself
and your friend.

11
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,208
You can do anything you want.

12
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,541
[YAMOTO]
How?

13
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,875
[SHI NINJA] I, Shi-Ninja,
will lend you my power.

14
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:22,583
It's yours for
the taking. Use it!

15
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,125
[YAMOTO]
This is my power now.

16
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,625
[SHI NINJA]
Yes! Use it to the fullest.

17
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,666
Just turn off your mind
and let it happen.

18
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,583
Bid them all sayonara!

19
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,083
[YAMOTO]
Now, we are one!

20
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,000
[SHI NINJA]
Yes! We are one!

00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,500

[YAMOTO gasps]
Who have I become?

28
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,541
Where are these feelings
of rage coming from?

29
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,833
What matters now,
is that they are mine.

30
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,458
I feel this rage.

31
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,916
You saved my life.

[sobbing]

33
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,291
They were gonna kill us!

[continues sobbing]

35
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,833
[YAMOTO] But they didn't.
It's gonna be okay.

36
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's go home.

37
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,875
[car horns honking]

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,875
[ASARI] Hey, Yamoto-san.
It's so good to see you.

39
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,875
Today's my first day back.

40
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:53,583
Domo, Asari-san.
It's mine too.

41
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,416
That guy sitting
in the back over there.

42
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,291
Do you know who he is?

43
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,250
I've no idea. But he
looks like trouble to me.

44
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,875
I think he's new here.

45
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,958
Probably a transfer student
or something.

46
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,250

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,166
[GANG MEMBER 03B]
You think you tough?

50
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,708
[YAMOTO]
Hm? Huh?

51
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,666
[GANG MEMBERS laughing]

52
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,041
Hey look! That's the
guy from this morning!

53
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,541
You're dead, bitch!

54
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,250
Let's get this thing
started already.

55
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,625
I don't wanna miss lunch.

56
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,166
You're gonna be
eatin' though a straw!

57
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,583
[NARRATOR] Oh my Buddha,
what a surprise!

58
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,125
Instead of getting his head
squashed like a tomato,

59
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,000
he actually grabs the bat!

60
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,625
Big mistake.
'Cause now, you're dead.

61
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,875
No way.

62
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,375
What's wrong?

63
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,166
[NARRATOR] Yamoto is filled with
a growing sense of dread.

64
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,958
She knows this boy
with the afro is like her.

65
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,583
A chosen one.

66
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,333
There is no doubt in her mind.
And there shouldn't be.

67
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:18,458
What she senses is the ninja
soul dwelling within him.

68
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,708
[GANG BOSS] Oh, you screwed up
now! We're gonna kill ya!

Abbah!

71
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,750
Heh.

72

[distant sirens wail]

73
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,166
Back off, man.

74
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,375
Don't you know
I'm the victim here?

75
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,916
I just got in and you're
already lettin' me out?

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mm?

77
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,125
Well, Domo, Shogo-san.
I am Fumatoni.

78
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,916
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,375
What do you want from me?

80
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,166
I came here to release you
from your iron cage.

81
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,083
Don't you want to fly again?

82
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,458
I will post your bond,
and even claim responsibility

83
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,833
for the incident
that got you here.

84
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,750
[SHOGO] I think I'm gonna
take the rap for that one.

85
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,125
[FUMATONI] Now slow down.
This is a delicate matter.

86
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,666
You should be extremely careful
about what you say here.

87
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,750
I ain't sayin nothin'.

Abba-ba-ba-ba-bah!

a rabid animal.

--[FUMATONI] Yeeart!
--[SHOGO] Aaaargh!

91
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,666
Do you honestly believe
your paltry ninja soul

92
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,833
gives you license to do
whatever the hell you want?

93
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,791
Arrogance beget by ignorance.

94
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,416
You don't know enough
to fully grasp

95
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
how insignificant you are.

96
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,000
Allow me to
introduce myself again.

97
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,250
Domo, Shogo-san.
I am called Sonic Boom.

98
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,000
A ninja of the
elite Soukai Six Gates.

99
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,250
Ninja are ya?

100
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,916
It would seem you find
yourself at a crossroads.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,583
Join our syndicate and live,
or refuse and die.

102
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,875
What is your decision?

103
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,958
[PUNK NINJA]
Domo, Shogo-san.

104
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,416
You know death
will be the end, right?

105
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,916
[SHOGO]
Who are you?

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
[PUNK NINJA]
Right, I'm Punk Ninja.

107
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,875
Grew up in London,
but I went tits up

108
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,791
and shuffled off
the coil in 1979.

109
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,083
[PUNK NINJA] My death
was complete bollocks.

110
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,750
Ol' grimmy's a real arsehole.

111
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,375
So don't be a wanker,
and get back on your feet.

112
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,333
[SHOGO] You don't get it!
I wanna die!

113
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,500
[PUNK NINJA] Sorry, mate.
Not really up to you, is it?

114
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,958
Besides, as of now,
you're a ninja.

115
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,166
[SHOGO]
Please stop!

116
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:48,208

[JOCKS gasp]

119
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,291
Do we need to continue
this conversation?

120
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,625
Or are we done?

121
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,541
[JOCK 03A] No we're done!
And we're very sorry!

122
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,666
But please, don't tell
anybody about this!

123
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,416
[YAMOTO] I won't,
but only if you promise

124
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,833
to never try it again.

125
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,875
[JOCKS]
Yes! We promise!

126
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,416
[YAMOTO]
That boy is just like me.

127
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,500
[YAMOTO] We're exactly
the same. Our fates.

128
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,916
[ASARI] Yamoto-san!
Are you okay?

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,250
The girls said they saw
some jocks bothering you.

130
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,250
And I was so afraid that--

131
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,208
There's nothing to
worry about. Everything's fine.

132
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,458
[ASARI sighs]

133
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,541
[YAMOTO] You should be
more worried for them.

134
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,041
--[ASARI sobbing]
--[YAMOTO] Don't cry.

135
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,375
[YAMOTO] Why were they talking
about me in the first place?

136
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,041
Well, uh. The word got out

137
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,708
that you were
in the origami club.

138
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,375
At your old school, I mean.

139
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,708
Yeah, I was.

140
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,083
I also heard that
you placed in the

141
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,208
All Inter-High
School Tournament.

142
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,333
So is it true?

143
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:25,166
Uh, yeah.
It's true. First place!

144
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,625
That's awesome!

145
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,541
[YAMOTO] Now, just blow some
air into this notch here,

146
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,208
and it's done.

147
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,875
[YAMOTO exhales]

148
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,875
[ALL]
Whoa! So cool!

149
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,708
[giggles]

150
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,750
[SHOGO] Screw this.
I could take down

151
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,416
this whole damn syndicate
if I wanted to.

152
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,166
That sounds like fun.

153
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,666
Domo, Shogo-san.

154
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,500
It would appear you've
passed your final exam, eh?

155
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,000
Of course,
if you had failed,

156
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,541
I would make sure
your death came swiftly.

157
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,958
Tch! Thanks, dick!

158
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,625
Maybe I should
go ahead and kill you too.

159
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:15,125
Ha! You're quite
welcome to try.

160
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,666
From now on, this is
what you'll be known as.

161
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,916
It's my gift to you,
as the godfather.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,833
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

163
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,291
But now your life
is not yours to take.

164
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,416
It belongs to the syndicate.

165
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,041
You can only take lives
for the Soukaiya.

166
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,916
[SUICIDE]
I get it. And I'm not

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,250
the man I used to be.

168
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,458
I'll be the
goddamn grim reaper,

169
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,333
but with a badass afro.

170
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,333
What a bold statement!

171
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:47,041
So then. Here's your
first mission.

172
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,333
Your target is this ninja.

173
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,958
She's a ninja? That chick?

174
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,833
I assure you
the syndicate investigated

175
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,083
the details of your pathetic
suicide attempt thoroughly.

176
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,458
Ninja soul possessions
require very extensive

177
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,083
research on our part.

178
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,125
When you gracelessly
fell from the sky,

179
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,666
you landed on this girl.

180
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,958
She was critically injured, but
was revived by a ninja soul.

181
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,666
What amazing providence!

182
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,750
You both escape death,
become possessed,

183
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,958
and transfer to
the same high school.

184
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,583
That kind of fate
cannot be ignored!

185
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,041

00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,000
I am Ninja Slayer.

173
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,166
I'll call you once
they're all dead. Hear?

174
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,916
[NOTORIOUS] Nobody really gives
a crap about your girlfriend.

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,875
In fact, I'm single
and loving it!

176
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,833
All I wanna do is show
off my sweet ass Bio-Iaido!

177
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,541
[DISTURBED moans]

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,458
You guys
hang back, will ya?

179
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,333
I'm stoked to show
this clown my Bio-Iaido!

180
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,583
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

181
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,541
[NOTORIOUS grunts]

182
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,041
[DISTURBED]
Yeeart!

183
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,458
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!

185
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,416
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[NOTORIOUS] Aargh!

186
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,708
[DISTURBED]
Yeeart!

187
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,916
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,916
[NOTORIOUS] Let's rock!
I'll cut ya right in half!

189
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,458
[NOTORIOUS]
Aaaargh!

190
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,083
[NANCY] Sorry boys, but two
against one just isn't fair.

191
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,458
[DISTURBED]
You little...

192
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,708
[NARRATOR]
She's open!

193
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,166
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DISTURBED] Aaaargh!

194
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,333
[NARRATOR] Ninja Slayer
unloads with another brutal

195
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,250
dark karate move!
The "Body Check!"

196
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,791
[NOTORIOUS]
Iaido! Yeeart!

197
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,666
[NOTORIOUS]
Booyah!

198
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,083
Notorious-san,
look above you!

199
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,041
[NOTORIOUS]
Uh! Huh?

200
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:53,250
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[NOTORIOUS] Aaaargh!

201
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,166
Allow me to behead you.

202
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,875
I gotta say,
that was a sweet ass move!

203
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,625
[FROGMAN]
Yaaah!

204
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,500
[NINJA SLAYER]
Nng! Not again!

205
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,083
We have learned
a painful lesson

206
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,833
from your dark karate.

207
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,416
So let's put a hold on this
battle for a little while.

208
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,833
Tell me this!

209
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,541
Do you ninjas
work for Yoroshisan?

210
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,958
Yeah, we used to work for
those cheap drug pushers,

211
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,958
but not anymore!

212
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,916
We're on our own now!

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,375
You can call us
the Survivor Dojo!

214
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,708
[FROGMAN] We were all
Bio-Ninja test subjects.

215
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,291
But then we
started thinking,

216
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,000
"should we be taking
orders from these

217
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,875
pencil-necked geeks?"
Hell no!

218
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,041
That's why
we're outta here!

219
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,958
So we can be free!

220
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,458
We are free at last!

221
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,625
[FROGMAN] But we're not greedy.
We gotta share our freedom!

222
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,083
So we're gonna go grab
all the other poor bastards

223
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,875
that they're keeping down
in the basement!

224
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,083
You didn't come out here
lookin' for us anyway, did ya?

225
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,625
So if you and
your lady friend wanna

226
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,625
snoop around, screw it.

227
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,458
Okay, I'm just gonna take
your silence as a yes.

228
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:03,166
Totally works for me.
We'll see ya later!

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,958
[sighs] Well, I guess
our work here is done.

230
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,500
The virus program
is doing its job.

231
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,375
The clones' genetic schematics
are being rewritten as we speak.

232
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,416
It's gonna take a pretty long
time for Yoroshisan to fix it.

233
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,333
That's very good to hear.

234
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,500
Now about the data
you promised me.

235
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,541
Hand it over.

236
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,750
[NANCY]
I still need to process it,

237
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,333
so you'll have to wait.

238
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,125
I'll get it to you soon.
You trust me, don't you?

239
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,958
[NANCY]
Mmm.

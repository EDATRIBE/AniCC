[NARRATOR]
The story of how Ninja Slayer

2
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,375
arrived in the secret hideout
of the revolutionary movement,

3
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,041
Ikki Uchikowashi is a
ascinating one indeed.

4
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,375
And at its center is Yukano,

5
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:57,125
the granddaughter of
his sensei, Dragon Gendoso.

6
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,583
[ANSWERER]
Hajime!

[NINJA SLAYER shouts]

9
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,250
[NARRATOR] After Darkninja's
devastating attack

10
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,583
on Gendoso's bamboo grove,

11
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,875
Yukano fled and somehow
lost her memories.

12
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,500
She is now an agent
working for the

13
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,666
leftist rebel ninja group,

14
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,375
and goes by the name Amnesia.

15
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,416
A fitting title.

16
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,333
[GIANT shouts]

17
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,291
[groans]

18
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:24,500
With that. I hereby welcome
Ninja Slayer-san into our ranks

19
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,208
and to fight alongside us in the
name of progress and revolution.

20
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,833
[PARTY MEMBERS] We approve!
Revolution! Revolution!

21
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,708
Domo, Ninja Slayer-san.

22
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,458
I am the one they call Answerer.

23
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,583
You are now part of
Ikki Uchikowashi.

24
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,125
Domo.

25
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,000
[NARRATOR] Before moving on
to the next plane of existence,

26
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,625
Dragon Gendoso's spirit charged
Fujikido to watch over Yukano.

27
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,208
Now he must investigate
this group she's joined.

28
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,416
[NINJA SLAYER] What can
you tell me about Yuk--

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,916
I mean, Amnesia-san?

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,083
[ANSWERER] She is an
outstanding warrior.

31
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,833
[NINJA SLAYER] What can you
tell me about your leader,

32
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,166
this Buster Tetsuo?

33
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,875
[ANSWERER]
He is an outstanding leader.

34
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,333
[NINJA SLAYER] Is this
"Buster" a ninja as well?

35
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,583
[ANSWERER]
All your questions will be

36
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,708
answered in due time, comrade.

37
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,166
And allow me to remark on your
astonishing combat skills.

38
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,458
It may seem like hyperbole,

39
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,375
but just adding your
strength to ours has

40
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:21,458
doubled our potential for
radical progressive revolution.

41
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,666
Your previous exploits
have been...

42
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,333
Somewhat "lacking in direction,"
to put it politely.

43
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,916
[clears throat]
Please forgive me,

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,791
but I truly believe
that joining our cause

45
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,916
will provide you with
the opportunity to harness

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,541
your ninja skills and let
them be a driving force

47
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,750
for meaningful progressive
change in our society.

48
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,333
Perhaps that will be the case.

49
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,833
We have a common enemy.

50
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,833
Defeating Laomoto Khan is
paramount to overthrowing

51
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,458
the bourgeois ruling
class once and for all.

52
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,541
[PARTY MEMBER A]
Incoming signal!

53
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,041
Comrade Flickshot-san
has returned!

[PARTY MEMBERS] Recognized!
Revolution! Progress!

55
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,208
The ruling class has
long had its boot

56
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,875
on the neck of the proletariat,

57
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,583
but you will provide
the downtrodden

58
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,583
with a katana sharp
enough to sever the heads

59
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,458
of their oppressors
once and for all.

60
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,708
Domo, comrades.

61
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,083
Answerer-san and
Ninja Slayer-san.

62
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,166
I am comrade Flickshot.

63
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,333
[NARRATOR] Like a bullet shot
from the barrel of a gun,

64
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,541
a small transport
pierces the almost

65
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,125
artificial natural scenery
with amazing speed.

66
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,625
It is the two-car bullet train,
dubbed The Galaxy.

67
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,666
Despite the immense
connotation of its name,

68
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,375
it is the smallest
in existence,

69
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,708
and carries quite a
rather unique cargo.

70
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,833
A cargo so unique,
it has caught the eye

71
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,583
of the militant
progressive revolutionaries

72
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,833
known as Ikki Uchikowashi.

73
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,958

[FLICKSHOT]
Domo, Prominence-san.

I am a warrior for revolution.

91
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,583
And I fight in the name
of Ikki Uchikowashi.

92
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,791
I am Comrade Flickshot.

93
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,875
Our mission here is to confirm
this bourgeois bullet train

94
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,625
is nothing more than a
transport for the Soukaiya.

95
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,541
The true enemy of the people.

96
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,958
Prominence-san,

97
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,541
you are a member of that
corrupt gang's elite Six Gates.

The ninja dagger in the
back of the proletariat.

99
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,625
Our aim is to purge
society of your evil.

100
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:55,291
[PROMINENCE laughs] So that's
how you substantiate your sins?

101
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,833
Flickshot-san,
your reputation precedes you.

102
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,416
My association is well
aware of your actions.

103
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,333
Your pitiful idea
of parceling out

104
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,625
possessions is sending
your pathetic party members

105
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,041
to plunder pachinko parlors,

106
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,291
and partition up the property
amongst your principals!

All of our comrades
that were ejected

115
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,666
from the transport are dead!
They've been turned into ashes!

Please allow me to
show you personally

how my Katone-jitsu is
the superior ninja weapon,

119
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,250

I am Prominence.

127
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,541
Has your one-man war
against the syndicate

128
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,625
now turned into a crusade under
the colophon of communism?

129

How completely comical!

130
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,833

[NARRATOR] Gouranga! This is
how a true ninja fights!

135
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,000
Although one may
possess specialized jitsu

136
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,625
or fearsome ninja weaponry,

137
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,500
If they don't have the
karate to back it up,

138
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,208
they will always
get their ass beat

Just as I thought!

The transport was hauling
decadent bourgeois goods!

00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,625
The Soukaiya are foot soldiers.

Preying on the working
class of Neo-Saitama.

148

that patrician puppet at once.

[FLICKSHOT] You're in

Now I realize the true
nature of the Ikki Uchikowashi

is not what you and your

00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,666
If you expect me to
believe a killer like you

177
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,958
has a problem purging
scum from our society,

178
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,875
Then we'll have to
purge you first!

179
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,875
[PARTY MEMBERS]
Assertion! Revolution! Progress!

180
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,875
This is a dangerous game you're
playing, Ninja Slayer-san.

181
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,250
You should realize that death

182
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,541
is also the only way
out for those infidels

183
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,625
who criticize Ikki Uchikowashi!

184
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,583
[PARTY MEMBERS]
Purge! Purge! Purge!

185
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,166
[FLICKSHOT]
Criticize yourself!

186
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,541
[yells]

187
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,708
[NINJA SLAYER yells]

188
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,041
[FLICKSHOT] I warned you
this is a dangerous game,

189
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,541
Ninja Slayer-san.

190
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,500
[FLICKSHOT]
One individual cannot overcome

191
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,958
the power of
collective ideology.

192
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,125
Their shields will ricochet!

193
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,375
[FLICKSHOT]
Don't you see?

194
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,333
My pachinko-jitsu and
the tools of my comrades

195
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,083
work in perfect harmony.

196
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,083
Feel our collective power!

197
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,916
[yells]

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,500
[NARRATOR]
Oh, my Buddha!

199
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:50,375
Their combined efforts result
in an omnidirectional attack!

200
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,416
[TRAIN CREW]
Hurry! Get inside now!

201
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,083
[TEACHER] While they're fighting
each other, we can escape!

202
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,166
[FLICKSHOT]
The poisonous ways

203
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,083
of the bourgeoisie
are trickling down

204
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,416
to the proletariats,

205
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,875
who are now content to
live in slothful idleness.

206
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,541
And you've taken
it upon yourself

207
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,000
to challenge the saviors
of the common man?

208
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,250
As an Ikki Uchikowashi
party member,

209
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,166
I declare you, Ninja Slayer-san,

210
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,875
to be a danger to society
and hereby submit

211
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,583
an ex-post-facto
resolution to purge you,

212
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,958
on which I now act!

213
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,833
[yelling]

214
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,583
[NINJA SLAYER yelling]

00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,958
[PARTY MEMBER screams]

216
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,000
Impossible!

217
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,666
[NINJA SLAYER shouts]

218
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,416

[PARTY MEMBERS scream]

224
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,333
No! Inconceivable!
We are the people's hammer!

225
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,208
The mighty blunt force
of the working class!

226
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,250
[NINJA SLAYER shouts]

227
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:57,333
[FLICKSHOT groans]

228
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,041
Now die, Ninja Slayer-san!

229
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:01,708
[NINJA SLAYER shouts]

230
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,375
[PROMINENCE groans]

231
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,000
[PROMINENCE]
Sayonara!

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,125
[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!

233
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,375
--[NINJA SLAYER shouts]
--[FLICKSHOT groans]

234
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,791
Earlier you said that I
was a danger to society,

235
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,833
challenging the saviors
of the common man!

236
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,666
But the true danger
is an organization

237
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,791
that believes power grows
from the barrel of a gun

238
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,541
and uses that philosophy
to slaughter the innocent.

239
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,875
You think mercy is worthless?
And compassion?

240
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,750
These concepts may not be in
your organization's vocabulary,

241
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,541
but they're what make us human!

242
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,916
[FLICKHOTS groans]

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,458
[NINJA SLAYER]
You and I are similar.

244
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,041
We're like two raccoons
from the same hole.

245
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,708
We're killers, plain and simple.

246
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,583
After all the blood
that we've spilled,

247
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,708
our humanity is the one
thing we can't lose.

248
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,000
We'd be monsters!
We'd be monsters!

249
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,000
[FLICKSHOT]
Sayonara.

250
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,208
Hmph. I must say,
he is quite fascinating.

251
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,041
But who is he?

252
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:11,625
Someone you used to know,
Amnesia-san. Very long ago.

253
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,333
In your former life.

254
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,958
[AMNESIA] I've forgotten
that life completely.

255
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,500
The organization is my life now.

256
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,958
And Ninja Slayer is threatening
it, so he must be dealt with.

257
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,916
I'd thought you'd
say that, and I agree.

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,541
To some extent.

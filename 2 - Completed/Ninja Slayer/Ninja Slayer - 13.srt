172
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:46,250
That's about it.
From above, downward.

173
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,916
From above, downward.

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,208
Damn straight.

175
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,000
From above and then
move it downward.

176
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,166
You got it.

177
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,916
[BOTH]
From above, downward.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,083
--[YAMOTO] From above,
--[KAGI] From above...

179
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,708
...downward.

180
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:07,416
[sirens wailing]

181
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,166
[SALARYMAN 01A mumbling]

182
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,416
[SALARYMAN 01A]
Abbah!

183
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,000
[SILVER KARASU]
Namu Amida Butsu.

184
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,833
[SMILING OLD MAN] All righty!
Now, if you will go to

185
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,166
the body and get
a few pictures for me,

186
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,250
I'd so appreciate it.

187
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,875
[SILVER KARASU]
You serious?

188
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,041
This place is about to be
crawling with cops.

189
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,541
[SMILING OLD MAN]
I need pictures.

190
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,250
[SILVER KARASU]
Send a commando--

191
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,125
[grunts]

192
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,916
Okay, fine.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,375
But I would
appreciate a bonus.

194
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,833
Kagi-san!

195
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,208
Oh hey.
What're you doing up?

196
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,958
It's gotta be
way past your bedtime.

197
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,375
You don't look so good.

198
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,666
[KAGI] Thanks.
Hazard of the trade.

199
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,083
You got a smoke?

200
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,000
Naw, that's a dumb question.

201
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,750
Forget me,
worry about yourself.

202
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:08,666
[KAGI coughs, retches]

203
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,916
[groans]
What a mess.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,791
But it's got nothin' to do with
what happened tonight.

205
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,125
So it's fine.
Everything's cool.

206
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,250
You expect me to believe
"everything's cool"?

207
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,208
I mean, the blood's not from
any combat-related injury.

208
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,041
In fact, these injuries
are nothin' next to

209
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,375
what is causing the blood,
so it equals out somehow.

210
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,833
You gotta go
to the hospital!

211
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,333
If I go there
I'm not comin' out!

212
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,875
[sobbing]

213
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,541
[KAGI]
Damnit. I didn't mean to

214
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,458
bite your head off.
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:42,125
That's not why
I'm crying, Kagi-san.

216
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,041
[continues sobbing]

217
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,666
[KAGI] I'm gettin'
in the shower.

218
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,458
And it is past your bedtime.

219
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,916
[KAGI] So this is how
the story ends for me, huh?

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,541
Hunched over a sink
full of blood

221
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,416
wondering about "my affairs."

222
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,333
--[KAGI] This pleases Buddha?
--[phone ringing]

223
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,875
[ringing continues]

224
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,250
[KAGI]
To hell with that.

225
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,583
Man.

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,666
[NARRATOR] Ninja Slayer
and Nancy formulated a plan

2
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,750
to assassinate Laomoto Khan,
the Soukaiya kingpin!

3
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,291
But the plan was leaked and
ninjas were sent to capture

4
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,750
Nancy and slay the
Ninja Slayer himself!

5
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,208
Our hero fought them off,

6
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,083
but Nancy is still in the
clutches of ruthless ninjas.

7
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,458
How could this have happened?

8
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,333
To find out, let's travel
back in time one day!

9
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,500
Correct me if I'm wrong,

10
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,041
but I believe Miyamoto
Musashi once said:

11
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,875
"Poke at affections
with a man-catcher,

12
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,791
and be swept up
in the maelstrom."

13
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,541
Or, something like that.

14
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,625
Yeah, uh, domo. This is
Trufflehog calling. Hey.

15
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,125
False alarm here.

16
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,333
Looks like this lucky fellah
won the stray bullet lottery

17
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,833
while he was surfing the net.

18
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,125
I don't think it's
syndicate related.

19
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,375
Yep. Just a victim of physics.

20
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,083
Hm? Wait. That's weird.

21
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,541
[snorts]

22
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,791
[NARRATOR] This ninja is an
expert at reconnaissance!

23
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,291
He can glean volumes
of information

24
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,916
from just a few sniffs!

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,125
Ah. Scent of ninja soul.

26
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,333
It's still close.

27
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,708
I'll just have to
follow my nose!

28
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,291
[TRUFFLEHOG]
Yeeart!

29
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,208
[WARLOCK] There are no Soukai
ninjas in that part of town.

30
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,458
In fact there have
not been for some time.

31
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:59,416
I think you may have rooted
out the elusive Ninja Slayer.

32
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,291
[TRUFFLEHOG] Yeah, domo.
I'm inside the apartment.

33
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,875
No one's here but me right now,

34
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,083
the Ninja Soul has
left the building.

35
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,541
Whoever lives here, doesn't
give a crap about decorating.

36
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,500
[WARLOCK]
Excellent work, Trufflehog.

37
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,833
[TRUFFLEHOG]
Thanks.

38
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,666
[WARLOCK laughs] But I shall
take over from here.

39
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,208
[TRUFFLEHOG]
Huh?

40
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,708
[WARLOCK shouts]

41
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,083
[NARRATOR]
And with that brief warning,

42
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,666
Warlock thrusts his
consciousness into Trufflehog!

43
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,500
It's the motionless
possession jitsu!

44
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,250
[laughs]

45
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,000
Well then, how about you
and I begin our dance,

46
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,125
Ninja Slayer-san?

47
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,333
[NARRATOR] This series of
events was set into motion

48
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,208
by the valiant
defense of Agata-san

49
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,166
by the chivalrous Ninja Slayer.

50
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,875
As the saying goes,
"no good deed goes unpunished,"

51
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,541
tossing out that no good bum
would indeed come back to haunt

52
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,208
our masked defender of justice.

53
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,250
[WARLOCK chuckles]

54
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,250
[NANCY grunts]

55
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,333
[gasps]

56
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,875
I'm here to pay
my respects, Nancy-san.

57
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:08,041
Domo, I am the one
known as Baba Yaga.

58
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,250
[gasps]

59
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,041
[BABA YAGA]
Actually, I have a task

60
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,208
I need you to
accomplish for me.

61
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,875
So try to stay alive
at least a bit longer.

62
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:21,291
[BABA YAGA laughs]

63
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,625
[NANCY gasps, grunts]

64
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,666
Damn it. This is impossible!
How can this be happening?

65
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,333
The transportation's ready.

66
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,500
Are you?

67
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,541
I simply just can't
comprehend it!

68
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,291
He makes no mistakes!
He's some kind of superhuman!

69
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,666
Let's take the girl and go!

70
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,416
Did you get all the
recording devices?

71
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,125
I may be flummoxed, but I have
not lost my presence of mind!

72
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,291
Let's make haste!

73
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,500
[WARLOCK]
We're plotting a straight course

74
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,666
directly to the wharf!

75
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,291
I do still have faith
in you! Trust me.

76
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,458
We are very far from
being checkmated!

77
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,458
[NANCY] My hideout at the
abandoned movie theater

78
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,625
was a secret to everyone,
including Ninja Slayer-san.

79
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,250
He won't know this pig has me!

80
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,916
This is an emergency,
yes, but a minor one.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,250
We get through this,

82
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,833
Ninja Slayer will have
no idea where to find us.

83
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,083
Absurd!

84
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,916
He found us, Warlock-san!

85
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,333
Oh Buddha. How can this be?

86
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,250
See ya!

87
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,791
[BASILISK]
Hold on! Let me handle him!

88
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,666
[NINJA SLAYER]
Domo, Basilisk-san,

89
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,458
pleased to meet you.
I am Ninja Slayer.

90
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,791
[BASILISK]
Domo, Ninja Slayer-san.

91
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,125
I am Basilisk. How the
devil did you find us?!

92
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,375
[NINJA SLAYER]
I'll show you how!

93
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,416
[shouts]

94
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,458
[BASILISK]
Huh?

95
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,166
[gasps]

96
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,625
[BASILISK]
Go on, Warlock-san!

97
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,416
I'll crush this fly!

98
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,666
[WARLOCK growls]

99
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,375
[BASILISK]
Yeeart!

100
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,208
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart! Yeeart!

101
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,000
Taste my tire tracks!

102
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:52,958
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

103
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,291
It was my mistake.

104
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,458
I should have killed you
from the beginning myself.

105
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,833
Instead of leaving
you to my underlings!

106
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,625
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[BASILISK] Yeeart!

107
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,833
Like you, I've tasted slaughter
and hunger for more!

108
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,958
It's a true warrior's feast!

109
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,958
And in this city I am
the apex predator!

110
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,250
[NARRATOR] Gouranga!
Am I seeing things?

111
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,208
I've heard of someone
being driven up the wall,

112
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,708
but this is ridiculous!

113
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,916
[BASILISK]
Yeeart!

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,958
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

115
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,708
[BASILISK]
Yeeart!

116
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,166
Now, Ninja Slayer-san.

117
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,875
Cough up your guts like
the road-kill you are!

118
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:24,625
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

119
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,375
[BASILISK]
What the-?

120
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,333
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

121
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,958
Yeeart! Yeeart!

122
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,166
[BASILISK]
Argh!

123

[BASILISK grunts]

124
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,041
[BASILISK] Very impressive,
Ninja Slayer-san.

125
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,083
Kwah!

126
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,625
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

127
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:40,916
[NARRATOR] Basilisk throws a
fierce stare with his evil eye!

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,875
Without his lightning
fast Ninja sixth sense,

129
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,208
Ninja Slayer would have been
vaporized by this fatal Jitsu!

130
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,041
[BASILISK] Hmph,
awfully quick on you feet.

131
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,500
My Evil Eye kills whether or not
it matches my opponent's gaze.

132
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,875
One hard look and it's all over.

133
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,791
Your demise will be
mine alone to witness!

134
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,625
Unfortunately, it is not an
attack I can use too often.

135
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,375
Kiyah!

136
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,833

00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,166
[NINJA SLAYER]
Aaaargh!

[NARRATOR] A forbidden
move in aikido circles,

143
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,625
it's the catapult throw!

144
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,291
[BASILISK]
Yeeart!

145
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,375
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

146
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,708
This will be your final moment.

147
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,500
Once you're dead, I will be
free to slay Laomoto Khan!

148
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:28,708
I'm sure you'll have a view
of the action. In hell!

149
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,333
[BASILISK] Seems that
you're feeling the poison

150
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,166
from my suriken! Ha!

151
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,291
You might as well
be dead already!

00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,625
[BASILISK]
Yeeart!

of monster are you,

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,625
Ninja Slayer-san?

159
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,500
[grunts]
You slayed four of my assassins,

160
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,791
and as for the
Shadow Guild-- Bleh!

161
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,708
Your death haiku. Recite it now.

162
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,333
I will not! Your pity is false.
Used only to mask your pride.

163
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,208
It will be your end! Kwah!

I am the ninja

[LAOMOTO]
Domo, Trufflehog-san.

172
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,791
Is this bedraggled woman
some sort of offering?

173
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,583
If that's what you wish.
But she is the one who summoned

you and DarkNinja-san
to this location.

175
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,083
She was plotting to
take both of your lives.

176
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,375
With a little help from
Ninja Slayer-san, that is.

177
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:01,666
Ho-ho. So she's in cahoots
with Ninja Slayer-san.

178
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,041
She is. And if we
torture her long enough,

179
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,666
we could get all
kinds of information

180
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,041
on this mysterious Ninja Slayer.

181
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,291
Yes, perhaps that's true.

182
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,708
Without further ado--

183
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,250
Gwah!

[NANCY gasps]

185
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,458
His true body will
be dealt with.

186
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,208
It will be dealt with.

[GATEKEEPER]
Domo, this is Gatekeeper.

189
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,291
The body's been dealt with.

190
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,458
[DARKNINJA]
It has been dealt with, sir.

191
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,791
You know how much I
appreciate efficiency.

192
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,625
[LAOMOTO, DARKNINJA]
Huh?

193
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,166
Neenja Slayer-san!

194
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,500
Ho-ho.

[NANCY grunts]

196
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,916
Then I shall take my leave.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,208
Toy with him a bit.

198
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,500
[DARKNINJA]
Consider it done.

199
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,916

I am Ninja Slayer.

That's enough.

206
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:06,333
I can't sit idly by and watch
you have all the fun, now can I?

Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Domo, Ninja Slayer-san.

I am Laomoto Khan.

I must tell you I admire your
bravery, in taking me on.

You work quickly, but I'm
the one in charge here!

[LAOMOTO] If you don't
broaden your focus,

00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,875
you will never see the
forest for the trees,

00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,250
or the natural order of things,

[NINJA SLAYER grunts]
Huh?

[NARRATOR]
The fatigue of endless battle

231
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,791
and the poison
inflicted by Basilisk

232
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,583
have taken their toll
on Ninja Slayer!

00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,583
He is getting tore
up by Darkninja!

Return, Darkninja!

[LAOMOTO]
Mwah-ha-ha-ha!

That was quite an
entertaining show!

238
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,291
But the mongrel's
had enough.

239
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,416
I think it's time we
put him to sleep.

00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,791
If whoever originally coined
that phrase were to witness

Would that ricochet and cause
his untimely but imminent death?

I'm still not done.
One more battle.

[NARRATOR] Or was that shining
good deed in a weary world,

00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,708
a harbinger of the
golden light of humanity?

259
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,125
A light that Ninja Slayer will
surely summon from

Pandora's Box.

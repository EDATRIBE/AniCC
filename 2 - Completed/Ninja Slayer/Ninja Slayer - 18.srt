[SHOP OWNER]
Welcome! Come on in.

00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,375
[gasps]

4
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,083
It's good to see you, Naraki.

5
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,166
Aieee. Uh, domo, Maname-san.

6
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,500
Glorious. Sounds like you
truly believe in the cause.

7
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,750
Yeah, so I wanna be
as useful as I can,

8
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,083
but I'm kinda new to this.

9
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,916
Like I've never marched before.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,333
Do you think I
should bring a jitte,

11
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,208
or a bo staff, just in case?

12
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:13,708
[giggles] You could,
but I don't suggest it.

13
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,250
We want peaceful reforms,
not revolution.

14
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,875
Plus, if we did take up arms,

15
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,083
we'd give the cops
an excuse to arrest us,

16
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,333
the news to condemn us.

17
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,041
And the people to do nothing.

18
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,583
[NEWSCASTER] Now for more on the
so-called "Occupy Sugoitakai"

19
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,375
protest in the
Marunouchi district.

20
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,458
Its leaders describe the
movement as a grassroots

21
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,666
effort to end a number
of "unfair subsidies

22
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,708
and tax breaks" for
the Sugoitakai group,

23
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,500
amongst other Kyre tsu
Conglomerate companies.

24
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,250
So uh, how long have
you been marching there?

25
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,625
Two weeks. Our marches in
Marunouchi are getting bigger

26
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,208
thanks to people like you.

27
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,500
So what changed?

28
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,583
I thought that you
weren't "into politics."

29
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,875
You know, I... just had
a change of heart.

30
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,083
With some help from you.

31
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,375
Oh, really? I'm flattered!

32
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,500
[gasps]

33
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,958
I wish I could stay, but I
have some things to do

34
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,750
before the march.

35
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,166
Oh, sure.

36
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,625
I'll see you there.

37
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,291
Sounds good. I'll look for you.

38
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,333
[chuckles]

39
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,958
Draw from the power
of your ninja soul,

40
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,583
but never lose sight of
the man you truly are.

41
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,875
Between saving your butt
and honing your skills,

42
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,708
I've wasted a lot of time.
Make it count.

43
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,375
Oh, and look after
Yukano for me.

44
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,250
Now I realize the true nature
of the Ikki Uchikowashi

45
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,458
is not what you and your
"comrades" claim it to be.

46
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,333
You dare go against the
will of the movement?

47
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,958
Then we'll have
to purge you first!

48
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:34,791
[GENDOSO echos] Oh, and look
after Yukano for me...

[NINJA SLAYER]
Yuk-- I mean Amnesia-san's

50
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,583
amnesia changes nothing.

51
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,125
This "Buster-san" is
taking advantage of her.

52
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,000
And I must honor
Sensei's final request.

53
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,875
First I shall find Yuk--
I mean, Amnesia-san,

54
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,041
and then I'll make her remember.

55

A throng of protestors bound

56
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,375
for the Sugoitakai group's
Marunouchi headquarters.

57
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,041
They will march
through Neo-Saitama's

to make their presence known

59

to the salarymen in
the skyscrapers above.

60
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,833
What a massive crowd.
How'll I find Maname-san?

61
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,041
You seem lost.

That's my Alma Mater.

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,875
Good luck finding a
job when you're done.

69
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,541
So what brings you out here?

70
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,916
Doesn't seem to be your
passion for activism.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,708
It's cause of a girl, right?

72
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't not care about
this kinda stuff,

73
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,958
but yeah, there is a girl.

[laughs]
Oh, you dirty dog.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,416
Gimme a break. I wasn't totally
devoted to the cause at first.

76
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,625
But marching it out
like this? I dunno.

77
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,375
It's like I'm part of
something real. I like it.

00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,583
[BUSTER TETSUO]
Mm-hmm.

00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,958

[BUSTER TETSUO] Relax bro.
I'll take your word for it.

81
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,041
But ya gotta wonder.

82
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,125
Can we really change the
world by just marching?

83
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,166
Huh?

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,083

00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,250
Ya ever watch one of those
really old zombie movies?

86
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,833
The ones with real zombies.

87
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,541

started runnin' around

88
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,041
and pukin' everywhere.

89
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,291
Uh. Well yeah, of course.

90
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,916
[BUSTER TETSUO] Each individual
zombie is stupid, slow, weak.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,291
So we're not that surprised at
how well the survivors get on,

92
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,083
once things've settled down.

93
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,583
They hole up in a shopping mall,

94
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,458
hoard supplies, and live
in sheltered luxury.

I'm not sure if I follow ya.

96
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,041
[BUSTER TETSUO]
Just feel out this metaphor.

97
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,000
So when they get the smallest
chance: a half-closed door,

a rotting wall, these weak,
starving, stupid creatures

break through every barricade
in a sea of tattered flesh.

100
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,541
And one by one,
the survivors go down.

you planning to do here?

00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,666
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yah!

176
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,375
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

177
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,250
Chop away, Ninja Slayer!

178
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,250
You have no chance against
my Furinkazan hazy jitsu!

179
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,250
Soon you'll be surrounded
by fog and I'll kill you!

180
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,208
Damn it! Where is she?

181
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,000
Death and ninjas. Endless fog.

182
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,375
Why is this happening?

183
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:51,458
[sobbing]

184
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,458
[gasps]

185
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,625
[NARAKI]
Maname-san!

186
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,750
Do you remember me?
I came here to see you.

187
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,375
Why'd you shoot that student?

188
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,458
You turned the protest
into a slaughter!

189
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,333
His sacrifice was needed
for the cause to advance.

190
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,875
That's insane. No!
You can't mean that.

191
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,791
You said this wasn't
about violence!

192
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,750
Reform, not revolution.

193
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,416
That's what you said you wanted.

194
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,125
Why? Why'd you convince
me to come here?

195
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,750
Was it--? No...

196
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,291
It was more than just me.
You tricked others.

197
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,000
Conned yourself an army.
Told them nothing.

198
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,833
Put our lives in danger!

199
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,583
Everything you say is true.

200
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:36,125
We made you soldiers in a war
you weren't prepared to fight.

201
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,208
[sobs]

202
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,333
[YUKANO]
But complacency's not an option.

203
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:43,333
You can be a lone fugitive,
or you can be my comrade.

204
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,375
You'll need to stop
calling me Maname.

205
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,291
My true name is Amnesia.

206
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,875
[gasps]

207
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,375
[sobs]

208
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,833
[yells]

209
00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,875
[NINJA SLAYER shouts]

210
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,625
[grunts]
Let me go!

211
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,500
Yukano!

212
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,875
[YUKANO]
Don't call me that!

213
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,625
My name is Amnesia! The girl
you think I am is gone.

214
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,166
You have some nerve
showing your face

215
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,791
to an Ikki Uchikowashi soldier

216
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,250
after what you've done, traitor.

217
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,750
I should kill you now!

218
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,958
I am charged to look after
you by Dragon-Gendoso Sensei,

219
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,291
your grandfather!

220
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,875
Don't say that name!
It means nothing!

221
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,333
[NINJA SLAYER]
You manufacture violence,

222
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,208
lead innocent people
to their deaths,

223
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,041
and force the
survivors to join you.

224
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,291
Is that the life you want?

225
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,333
[YUKANO] Those people
should feel, honored!

226
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,916
Their corpses will build the
stairs to a truly equal world!

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,041
You really must have amnesia.

228
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,625
It seems you've forgotten
the smell of bullcrap!

229
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,291
How dare you say that?

230
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:47,083
Buster Tetsuo's the hero
inside every single soldier!

231
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,083
[NINJA SLAYER sighs]

232
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:54,125
Yukano, is this truly
who you want to be?

233
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,791
[YUKANO]
For the last time.

234
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,333
My name is Amnesia.

235
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,833
[JÖTUNN]
Release my comrade!

236
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,458
The lady isn't interested,
Ninja Slayer-san!

237
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,958
Your unsightly fixation
on her is begining--

238
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,250
Quiet, you!

239
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,083
[NINJA SLAYER shouts]

240
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:09,875
[JÖTUNN]
Gwar! Sayonara!

241
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,625
Damn you, Ninja Slayer-san!
Stop murdering my comrades!

242
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,666
Put that down. Your arrows
are useless against me.

243
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,375
[NINJA SLAYER]
Ikki Uchikowashi is my foe.

244
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,750
Now so are you, Amnesia-san.

245
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,625
Leave. And may we
never meet again.

246
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,250
[NARAKI grunts]

247
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,250
[YUKANO shouts]

248
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,833
[NARRATOR]
Ninja Slayer's thoughts reeled

249
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,208
as he scoured his
mind for a better way.

250
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,916
Could the right words
have convinced her?

251
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,041
Was he wrong to let her go?

252
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,250
His sensei had
given him one job,

253
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,166
and it seems he'd
failed spectacularly.

254
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,208
[SHOP OWNER]
Welcome. Come on in.

255
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,833
Ah! Hey, Senpai! I wanted
you to meet my friend.

256
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,000
[NARAKI]
I'm glad you came.

257
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,541
[KOHAI'S FRIEND] Okay, so do
ya think I should bring a jitte,

258
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,125
or a bo staff, just in case?

259
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,708
[KOHAI]
Don't be stupid.

260
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:20,166
Fair question, but the answer
is no. We don't do weapons.

261
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,958
Now lemme tell you why.

262
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,166
The problem with violent action,
is it doesn't really work.

263
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,333
Peaceful reforms are
the only kind that last.

264
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,875
That help people.

265
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,041
It's harder this way, but it'll
be well worth it in the end.

266
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,666
Yeah, I think you're right.

267
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,166
--Atta' boy.
--[watch beeps]

268
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,958
Sorry. Gotta run.

269
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:46,083
Thank you for showing
me the way, Amnesia.

270
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,500

[SHIGAKI]
Tamago.

00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,958
[NARRATOR]
Meet Shigaki.

3
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,750
Once he was an ink-wash painter,

4
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,333
who lived for the creation
of beautiful art.

5
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,125
Until his arm was
hacked off by a tofu press.

6
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,250
When Shigaki received
his settlement money,

7
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,625
he decided to purchase
a cybernetic arm.

8
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:57,916
[SHIGAKI]
Tamago.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,458
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
he could only afford

10
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,791
an old battle gauntlet:

11
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,000
cracked and worn
from decades of use.

12
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,083
Shigaki's unlicensed
prosthetist quipped that

13
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,791
it would cost an arm
if not a leg

14
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,666
to keep the gauntlet
in working order.

15
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,250
The joke bombed.

16
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,666
Maguro. No--Tamago.

17
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,791
[SHIGAKI] I'm rotting away here.
Gotta find more work soon.

18
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,000
[KOKESHI 05A]
Word is they're givin' out

19
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,541
those horsepower drinks.

20
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,041
[KOKESHI 05B] What, for free?
They bringin' on anyone, or?

21
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,291
[SHIGAKI]
'Scuse me, fellas.

22
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,083
[KOKESHI 05A, 05B]
Huh?

23
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,416
[SHIGAKI] I'd like to get a
piece of that action, if I can.

24
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,416
What's a guy gotta do?

25
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,166
[NINJA SLAYER]
This ends now, Bandit-san.

26
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,833
You have nowhere to run.

27
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,458
How'd you get my name?

28
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,500
Wait, you must be...
Ninja Slayer-san!

29
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:49,000
[NINJA SLAYER] Domo. Indeed.
I am Ninja Slayer.

30
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,166
[BANDIT]
Domo, I am called Bandit.

--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[BANDIT] Aaaargh!

32
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,875
[NINJA SLAYER] Now then.
Tell me what you know.

00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,666
[BANDIT]
Sayonara!

34
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,916
[NARRATOR]
He self-destructed!

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,583
The secrets of
the Soukai Syndicate have

36
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,750
shriveled away like the
skin on Bandit-san's corpse.

37
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,708
Or have they?

38
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,875
[KATAGI]
Laomoto-san!

39
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,958
You have my company's undying
gratitude and admiration.

40
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,916
[LAOMOTO]
Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,750
But of course.
Yoroshisan Pharmaceuticals

42
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,041
has provided me with an
unspeakable amount of drugs.

43
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,333
Now, about this
tofu maker: Sakaiesan.

44
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,500
My sources tell me they refuse
to purchase our yakuza clones.

45
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,791
Is this true?

46
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,750
It is true! What's more,
they continuously

47
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,083
refuse to join our
Keiretsu conglomerate!

48
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,208
How are guys like us
supposed to conduct business

49
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,416
if we have to compete
in a free market?

50
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,083
[LAOMOTO]
One simply does not provide

51
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,958
fairly priced tofu
to the working class.

52
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,666
Not on our watch.

53
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,083
My men will attack
their factory tonight.

54
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,000
And your company
will provide them

55
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,916
with the required materials.
Is that correct?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,791
[KATAGI]
Yes, absolutely sir!

57
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,541
Five hundred twelve packs of
special horsepower drinks,

58
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,500
and by "special" I mean
they're laced with enough

59
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,750
ZBR Adrenaline to
resurrect a dead elephant!

60
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,500
[LAOMOTO]
Five hundred?

61
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,958
[KATAGI] Aieee!
I'm extremely sorry, sir,

62
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,833
I meant a thousand
twelve packs!

63
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,416
Made a little typo
with my mouth.

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,291
[LAOMOTO]
Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,541
Excellent!

66
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:23,500
Eh? Why have you
returned, Darkninja?

67
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,708
Bandit-san has gone missing.

68
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,083
I don't care
if he self-immolated.

69
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,375
There can be
no delay in the plan.

70
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,375
If Bandit is gone, then
deliver the secret document

71
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,875
to Beholder yourself.

72
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,458
Sir.

73
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,250
[SHIGAKI] If folks are gatherin'
to take down a tofu plant

74
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,083
then the whole world's
gone to hell.

75
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,458
[KOKESHI 05A] They wanna
stick it to the man,

76
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,833
but I guess the vegetarians
are the next best thing.

77
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,166
[KOKESHI 05B] Strange.
Of all places, they chose

78
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,500
to attack the
Sakaiesan Tofu plant.

79
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,333
How many of these bums
are only able to eke out

80

a living because of the
hundred yen tofu quartets

81
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,416
that they're about to destroy?

Ah, I love these things!

Uuh.

Lemme tell ya why you're here,

for us to take revenge

against that despicable
company Sakaiesan Tofu!

92
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,333
Thanks to their deplorable

I got shoved
into their generator.

Their carelessness left me
paralyzed for life.

95
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,750
They paid their lame
excuse for blood money

96
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,708
and then sent me packing!

97
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,041
Since that day I have
heard tale after tale.

[NARRATOR] Oh, my Buddha!

But the sensation he feels
coursing through his veins?

103
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,708
It's a reaction to
the ZBR Adrenaline

104
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,250
with which his drink is laced.

105
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,416
[BEHOLDER] Sakaiesan Tofu is

Their tofu may be cheap,

107
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,833
but it's filled to
the brim with carcinogens

108
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,083

to shrink our brains!

00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,416
And kiss this world
of violence goodbye.

173
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,291
[BEHOLDER] Marvelous!
And incredibly ruthless.

174
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:02,166
A man of your talent would fit
right in with the Soukaiya.

175
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,625
[SHIGAKI]
Beholder-san lied.

176
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,375
He isn't a former
factory worker

177
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,416
burning with rage against tofu.

178
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,250
[SHIGAKI] He's a
Soukai Yakuza? A yakuza!

179
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,708
Please spare me, sir!
I'm just a humble laborer

180
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,333
who aspires to be
an ink-wash painter!

181
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,500
[BEHOLDER]
Let me see your face.

182
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,166
[SHIGAKI]
Huh? Aieee!

183
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,583
On your feet! If you're
too scared to join us,

184
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,666
die like a man!

185
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,291
[SHIGAKI]
Aieee! Please spare me!

186
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,500
--[BEHOLDER laughing]
--[SHIGAKI screaming]

187
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,416
[NINJA SLAYER]
Wasshoi!

188
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,750
[BEHOLDER]
Who the hell are you?

189
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,583
[NINJA SLAYER]
Domo. I am Ninja Slayer.

190
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,125
[BEHOLDER] Domo.
I am called Beholder.

191
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,583
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

192
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,083
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[SHIGAKI] Aaaargh!

193
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,625
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

194
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,625
[NINJA SLAYER groans]

195
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,875
Let's see what's
under that mask.

196
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:59,000
[NINJA SLAYER groans]

197
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,916
[BEHOLDER] But why
should I do the work?

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Be a good slave and take
that faceplate off yourself.

199
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,291
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[BEHOLDER] What the--?

200
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,041
--[NINJA SLAYER] Aaaargh!
--[SHIGAKI] Yeeart!

201
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,958
You broke my
kanashibari-jitsu?

202
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,416
I was planning
to take you alive,

203
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,958
but that was
clearly a mistake.

204
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,750
[NINJA SLAYER gasps, groans]

205
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,833
[NARAKU] That was
quite foolish, Fujikido.

206
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,166
[NINJA SLAYER]
What do you mean?

207
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,375
[NARAKU] His kanashibari-jiitsu
is very powerful.

208
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,291
Meet it with your naked eyes,
and it will kill you instantly.

209
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,500
Let me take over

210
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,708
and I'll paint the walls
with his blood!

211
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,000
[NINJA SLAYER]
No! Never!

212
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,083
[NARAKU] Have you forsaken
the path of revenge?

213
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,791
Go on! Crush him
like a can of spoilt tuna!

214
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,666
[SHIGAKI]
Aieee!

215
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,375
[NINJA SLAYER yells]

216
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,750
[SHIGAKI]
Yeeart!

217
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,541
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[SHIGAKI] Aieee!

218
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,208
[NINJA SLAYER]
Prepare yourself.

219
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,458
The Cobra Ninja Clan's
about to be short one member.

220
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,916
There is no place for you
in the world of true ninjas!

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,291
Nor is there mercy.

222
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,500
Yeeart!

223
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,250
[groans]

224
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,833
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

225
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,791
[NARRATOR] Ninja Slayer didn't
turn his back to throw shade.

226
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,291
He's countered the
kanashibari-jitsu!

227
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,541
[NINJA SLAYER] Behold,
the way of the true ninja!

228
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,708
[BEHOLDER]
Aieee!

229
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,541
[quavers]

230
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,208
--[NINJA SLAYER yells]
--[BEHOLDER groans]

231
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,166
[NINJA SLAYER] Where are
the Soukai Six Gates?

232
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,750
Well no one's seen
Bandit-san for a while.

233
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,416
[NINJA SLAYER]
Because I killed him.

234
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,166
[BEHOLDER] Aieee!
Hugeshuriken-san

235
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,041
and Earthquake-san
were told to burn down

236
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,083
the Dragon Dojo, but they
can't until they find it!

237
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,083
Hellkite-san was flying
somewhere around here,

238
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,166
but we finished the mission,
so he's probably gone!

239
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,458
Buddha only knows what
Daedalus-san and his gang

240
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,416
are getting into
and there's no one else!

241
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,083
I swear!

242
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,083
[NINJA SLAYER] Now then.
There's a Soukai ninja

243
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,291
who killed a salary-man
named Fujikido Kenji,

244
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,750
and his wife and child
several months ago.

245
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,875
In the Marunouchi
Sugoitakai Building.

246
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,500
Tell me his name!

247
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know; we don't
count civilian kills,

248
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,750
but if this was in
the Marunouchi Feud

249
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,458
it was most likely Darkninja!

250
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,916
[groans]

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,458
Sayonara!

252
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,000
[NINJA SLAYER gasps]

253
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,958
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

254
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,708
[SHIGAKI gasps]

255
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,791
[clanging]

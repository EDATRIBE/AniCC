[distant owl hooting]

2
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,333
[NARRATOR] The skin of
Neo-Saitama is comprised

3
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,458
of grime ridden concrete.

4
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,833
Still, it does harbor
a few places of beauty,

5
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,166
such as this bamboo grove.

6
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,541
Ninja Slayer
swiftly circumvents

7
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,416
a scattered web of wire traps.

8
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,041
He knows this place.

9
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,250
Clappers,
a traditional booby trap

10
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:06,666
among the ninja.
Useful tools indeed.

11
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,166
[NINJA SLAYER grunts]

12
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,625
[WOMAN]
Kieee!

13
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,291
[NARRATOR]
It's an ambush!

14
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,041
I nearly made you
flinch that time.

15
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,666
You should give me
bonus points. Hm.

16
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,625
No, Yukano.
We'll leave that to Sensei.

17
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,666
[FUJIKIDO] How is
the master's condition?

18
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,416
[YUKANO]
Worse every day.

19
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,000
[FUJIKIDO]
I see.

20
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,791
[NARRATOR] This proud
warrior was the master

21
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,375
of the Dragon Dojo.

22
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:46,166
Still he bears the name of
"Roshi Ninja." Dragon Gendoso.

23
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,708
[FUJIKIDO]
Sensei.

24
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,083
[GENDOSO]
That you, Fujikido?

25
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,916
[NARRATOR] Huge-Shuriken
poisoned the master

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,625
with the anti-ninja
virus, Takeuchi.

27
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,500
Since then, he has been
a shadow of his former self.

28
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,875
A shadow on the brink of death.

29
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:02,791
[FUJIKIDO]
Yukano.

30
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,208
Huh?

31
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,791
[FUJIKIDO]
For him.

32
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,166
This vial is from
Yoroshisan Pharmaceuticals.

33
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,666
I believe it's the cure
to this virus.

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,250
How'd you get it?

35
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,000
[NARRATOR] There was no way to
describe the trials he'd endured

36
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,041
in pursuit of that
holy grail of antidotes

37
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,208
without letting go
of his modesty.

38
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,000
So he kept his silence.

39
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,916
That was rash. You
shouldn't have done it.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,500
It was a simple task.

41
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,250
All I needed was my iron will,
and the ninja soul within me.

42
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,875
That is precisely
why it was rash.

43
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,750
[FUJIKIDO] At times,
I find Naraku's thirst

44
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,583
for blood repugnant,
but I do owe him.

45
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,500
Without his soul, I'd just
be another casualty.

46
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,833
I no longer live
to seek revenge.

47
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,208
But to leave evil ninja alive
when I have the strength

48
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,875
to stop them would be
a crime worse than theirs.

49
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,541
They prey on the weak,
so I must slay them.

50
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,291
I mixed the
antidote into your tea.

51
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,375
Please drink it all.
I'm sure it'll help.

52
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,833
I thank you both.

53
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,291
This is a foolish thing
you've done for me.

54
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,291
Foolish and kind.

55
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:14,083
[rumbling]

56
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,541
[FUJIKIDO] Yukano!
Stay with Sensei! Yeart!

57
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,416
[NARRATOR] An explosion set
the bamboo grove ablaze.

58
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,166
Who did this? Why?

59
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,625
[NINJA SLAYER grunts]

60
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,125
[NINJA SLAYER]
How was I followed?

61
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,375
[NINJA SLAYER]
Huh?

62
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,500
[beeping]

63
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,375
[NINJA SLAYER grunts]

64
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,833
Domo. Ninja Slayer-san.

65
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,500
I am Darkninja.

66
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,000
[NINJA SLAYER]
Domo. Darkninja-san.

67
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,500
I am Ninja Slayer.

68
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,583
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

69
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,208
Uh-oh. Aaaargh!

70
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,208
My iaido is
beyond the reach

71
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,083
of your pathetic karate.

72
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,541
You've slayed
your last ninja, Slayer.

73
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,291
You've stepped on the tail of
the tiger that is Soukaiya.

74
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,083
And now you shall
meet your bloody end

75
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,791
between its jaws.

76
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,833
The boss is sick of
hearing about you.

77
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,291
So he sent me.

78
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,541
You call yourself
a true ninja.

79
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,416
Let me to show you
what that means.

80
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,041
Yeeart!

81
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,416
[NINJA SLAYER]
Aaaargh!

[groans]

83
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,833
This lusty sword
is named Beppin.

84
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,708
Mark my words,
she shall drink her fill

85
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,000
of your blood before
this night is out.

86
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,541
You think you're
skilled because you've

87
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,666
slaughtered men even worse at
playing ninja than you are?

88
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,208
Filthy poser.

89
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:08,000

Wasshoi! Yeeart!

90
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,083
Yeeart!

91
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,625
[DARKNINJA]
Pathetic. Huh?

92
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,708
How did you--?

93
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,416
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

94
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,666
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

95
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,125
[NARRATOR] If there are any
amongst our viewers who have

96
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,750
schooled themselves
in 19th century

97
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,708
North American Ninja History,
you will be all too familiar

98
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,583
with this brutal
karate technique,

99
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,416
called the "Alabama Drop."

100
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,958
This attack was developed
by the evil ninja assassins

101
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,416
of Santa Ana,
the Mexican Sun Tzu,

102
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,416
during the Texas War
of Independence.

103
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,791
The Abundantly Dark
Side of History says,

104
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,333
"They repeatedly
lift and slam their

105

victims' melons into the earth,

106
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,583
as if determined to plant their
bloodied skulls within it."

107
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,708
[NINJA SLAYER]
Aaaargh!

108

[NARRATOR]
The tables turn again!

109
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,416
Should any of our viewers
possess the hawk-like vision

110
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,958
of a ninja, they'll have seen
exactly what occurred.

111
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,541
But for the wretched
majority: a recap.

112
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,083
Darkninja found
the weakest point

113
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,875
in Ninja Slayer's hold,
bashed it,

114
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,083
took control of their fall
and flung Ninja Slayer

115
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,708
into a world of hurt!

116
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,791
Any physicists amongst
our viewers would say

117
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,458
these ninja moves
make Newton's

118
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,208
laws of motion seem
like far-out theories!

119
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,250
I've turned your ultimate
move against you, yield.

120
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,333
Death is the only
way out for ninjas.

Kirisute.

122
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,750

Huh?

Gomen!

[NINJA SLAYER gasps]
Aaaargh!

125
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,958
[DARKNINJA] That one's
called my "Death Kiri."

126
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,541
[DARKNINJA] Now, allow me
to behead you.

127
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,625
[NARRATOR] No! Ninja Slayer lies
bleeding and defenseless.

128
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,208
Can such a man
find peace in death?

129
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,958
[GENDOSO]
Take my head instead,

130
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,458
if you have the skill.

131
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,916
[DARKNINJA]
Huh?

132
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,625
Domo.

133
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,166
I am known as Roshi Ninja.

I am Darkninja.

136
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,791
So you survived
the poison and the bomb.

137
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,958
What divine providence.

138
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,333
I'll claim two fine
trophies on this night.

139
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,541
Trophies are
useless to the dead.

140
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,375
Only Ninja Slayer
will survive this night.

142

156
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,708
It was you there.

157
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,791
At the Marunouchi
Sugoitakai building!

158
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,041
My wife, my child, you killed
them both you bastard!

159
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,166
[DARKNINJA] Ooh. Could've sworn
I killed everyone in there.

160
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,916
Were you gone, or merely hiding?

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,833
[NINJA SLAYER] I'll kill you.
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

162
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:44,000
[NARAKU] That's right,
Fujikido. You're a killer!

163
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,625
Now then, turn your body
over to me and take a rest.

164
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:52,416
I will see to it that you
get your sweet revenge.

165
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,541
[GENDOSO] Nonsense!
Pay his words no heed.

166
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,208
[FUJIKIDO]
Sensei, you're here?

167
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,083
I always will be.

168
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,333
But not like this, so here is
your final assignment.

169
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,166
Never allow your ninja soul
to consume you again.

170
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,583
Harness its power,
but don't forget your body

171
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,500
is a ship and
you're the captain.

00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,666
Draw from the power
of your ninja soul,

175
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,250
but never lose sight
of the man you truly are.

176
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,250
This is farewell, Fujikido.

177
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,541
Between saving your butt
and honing your skills,

178
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,500
I've wasted a lot of time.
Make it count.

179
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,708
Oh, and look after
Yukano for me.

180
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,166
[FUJIKIDO]
Sensei!

181
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,750
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DARKNINJA] Impossible!

182
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,250
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

183
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,833
[DARKNINJA]
Aaaargh!

184
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,250
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DARKNINJA] Aaaargh!

185
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,750
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DARKNINJA] Aaaargh!

186
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,708
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DARKNINJA] Aaaargh!

187
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,208
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DARKNINJA] Aaaargh!

188
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,833
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DARKNINJA] Aaaargh!

189
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,500
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DARKNINJA] Aaaargh!

190
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:04,375
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DARKNINJA] Aaaargh!

191
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:08,125
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DARKNINJA] Aaaargh!

192
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,875
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[DARKNINJA] Aaaargh!

193
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,541
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

194
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,583
[NARRATOR] Ninja Slayer's stance
may seem reminiscent of jujutsu,

195
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,666
but it's part of a far more
ancient martial art.

196
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,666
Chado of the Assassin!

197
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,833
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

198
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,708
[DARKNINJA] Aaaargh!
Aaaargh! Aaaargh!

199
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,041
[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
Yeeart! Yeeart! Yeeart!

200
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,458
--[DARKNINJA] I.
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!

201
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,833
--[DARKNINJA] Am.
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!

202
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,375
--[DARKNINJA] Beat-en!
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!

203
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,208
[NINJA SLAYER]
Sensei.

204
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,375
[helocopter blades whirl]

205
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,000
[NINJA SLAYER]
Huh?

206
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,208
[NARRATOR] Though Ninja Slayer
managed to harness

207
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,291
his ninja soul's full strength
without yielding to its will,

208
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,083
his thoughts are burning
like his master's corpse.

209
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,875
Could he have
saved Sensei?

210
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,500
Did Yukano find a way out?

211
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,708
Forget such things,
Ninja Slayer! Run!

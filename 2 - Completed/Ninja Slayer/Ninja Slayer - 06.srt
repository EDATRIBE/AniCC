[BOTH] Muah-ha-ha-
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

7
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,125
That kind of discipline can
only be found in clones.

8
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,333
They're killing machines
that can't be stopped!

Um. Laomoto-san!

I am terribly sorry, sir!

17
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,041
If those clones
could kill my ninjas,

18
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,625
I would have to ask myself if
they were loyal to me or to you.

19
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,166

you've provided me

Mmm.

First, there is Niinja Slayer.

28
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,291
Second is the Dragon Dojo.

29
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,458
I want you to
go with Earthquake

30

[HUGESHURIKEN] Excuse me sir;
I seem to be lost.

35

Where might I find
the Dragon Dojo?

37

We've got some

from Hellkite-san.

56
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,250
It seems he's found
the Dragon Dojo for us.

57
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,333
Wow, the bat did
something right for once.

58
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:07,250
I'm sure he'll take more than
his share of the credit too. Ah!

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,833
I was just about to
take that piss-bag's

[EARTHQUAKE] This traffic
is intolerable.

Are they obstructing me
deliberately?

I don't have time for this.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,833
There's no room in the plan
for such a lengthy commute!

Who's responsible for this?

That bastard Ninja Slayer;
he's on his way now!

70
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,000
Ninja Slayer? There's no way
he could have found us!

71
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,083
Does he know
about our plan?

[tires screech]

73
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,791
[HUGESHURIKEN] He attacked
me like a mad-man!

No, like a rabid wolf
with blood red eyes!

75
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,791
Earthquake-san,
we have to move faster!

76
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,541
He'll catch up with us in a
matter of seconds at this rate!

77
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,708
[EARTHQUAKE] A formidable
opponent he may be,

78
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,458
but I doubt he has what it takes
to defeat the both of us.

79
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,916
What confounds me
is the fact that

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,500
he's showing up here and now.

81
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,958
Is it merely a coincidence,

82
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,875
or is he interfering
with our attack?

83
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,583
Does this mean he
and the Dragon Dojo

84
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,875
are somehow connected?

00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,125

do you seek the Dragon Dojo?

[HUGESHURIKEN]
D'ya really expect us

[GENDOSO] It seems Ninja Slayer
won't be showing up after all.

00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,958
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

172
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,833
[NARAKU]
Well done, my boy!

173
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,250
Now that you've admitted
you're a pantywaist,

174
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,125
Daddy's gonna slit
some ninja spleens!

175
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,208
Not just the Six Gates ninja,

176
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,333
I'll make ribbons outta
every last one of em!

177
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,625
[EARTHQUAKE]
Hm?

178
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,125
--[YUKANO] Ngaaah!
--[EARTHQUAKE grunts]

179
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,583
Ngaaah!

180
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,833
[EARTHQUAKE]
Aaaargh!

181
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,666
Yukano! Run away!

182
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,083
[YUKANO gasps]

183
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,708
[grunts]

184
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,291
--[YUKANO] Kiee!
--[EARTHQUAKE grunts]

185
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,791
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

186
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,833
--[NINJA SLAYER] Yeeart!
--[EARTHQUAKE] Yeeart!

187
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,041
[NARRATOR]
The red light of madness

188
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,458
has vanished from his eyes.

189
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,916
Now they run with
manly tears of blood.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,833
Yukano and Gendoso's cries have
re-awakened Fujikido's ego!

191
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,416
[NINJA SLAYER] I'd pay
any price for a chance

192
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,083
at revenge, but those lives
aren't mine to barter.

193
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,458
[EARTHQUAKE]
Yeeart!

194
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,333
[NINJA SLAYER]
Aaaargh!

195
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,041
[NINJA SLAYER]
I tried to slay the people

196
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,666
I set out to protect.

197
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,166
There's no virtue
in the fact that I failed.

198
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,916
I'm as bad as the ninja scum
that slayed my family.

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,250
[NARRATOR]
Are we about to witness

200
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,250
the downfall of our hero?

201
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,958
[NINJA SLAYER] I need
rest and there's no futon,

202
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,291
so I'll just die.

203
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,333
I'd commit sepuku
if I had a sword.

204
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,041
[GENDOSO] On your feet,
Ninja Slayer-san! Now!

205
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,666
Gendoso-san!

206
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,250
You're just
an ancient relic.

207
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,666
The age of true ninjas
is over! Yeeart!

208
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,875
Remember this well,
Ninja Slayer-san!

209
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,791
A true ninja doesn't fight
power with power alone!

210
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,625
Consider this
your first lesson!

211
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,000
Study my movements
and do as I do!

212
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,500
[NINJA SLAYER]
Huh? Yeeart!

213
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,708
Now, Ninja Slayer-san,
use your shuriken! Yeeart!

214
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,541
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

215
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:46,250
[EARTHQUAKE]
Nng! Aaaargh!

216
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,041
Listen up! The first truth
I wish to teach you

217
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,250
is illustrated by the giant
standing before us.

218
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,916
Remember, if you
cannot slay your foe

219
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,291
with one hundred shurikens,

220
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,375
that doesn't mean that
you attack with only one.

221
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,958
It means you throw
one thousand shurikens!

222
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,000
Hellkite-san,
you tardy bastard,

223
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,291
why haven't you come
with the reinforcements?

224
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,958
You've left us for dead!

225
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,750
Huge! Wake up, please!

226
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,250
[BOTH]
Yeeart!

227
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,375
[NARRATOR]
Dragon Flying Kick!

228
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,416
[EARTHQUAKE]
Aaaargh!

229
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,458
Sayonara!

230
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,708
Congratulations.

231
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,083
You've passed the first
section of your training.

232
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,583
You've saved
my life twice now,

233
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,583
but I don't understand why.

234
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,000
Inside your soul,
I see a battle between

235
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,125
a pitch-black shadow
and a warm golden light.

236
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,541
That light
is of your spirit,

237
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,333
and should it
banish the shadow,

238
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,166
I can guide your soul to the
heights of Kinkaku Temple.

239
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,750
A path I've walked before.

240
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,541
Sensei!

241
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,666
[chuckles]

242
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,166
--[squelch]
--Aaaargh!

243
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,916
--[NINJA SLAYER gasps]
--Aaaargh!

244
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,375
[NARRATOR]
A dart in the back!

245
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,291
Fired by none other
than Hugeshuriken!

246
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,625
He's still alive!

247
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,416
The dart was coated in
Takeuchi, an anti-ninja

248
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,083
virus developed by
Yoroshisan Pharmaceuticals.

249
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,083
It works its way through the
body of Japan's last true ninja,

250
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,083
leaving devastation in its wake.

251
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,000
[NINJA SLAYER]
You poisoned him? Really?

252
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,375
What kind of pansy ninja
fights with poison?

253
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,291
Damn you and your hopping.

254
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,916
Now I'm fresh out of darts.

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,833
Ya see, Earthquake
used me as a decoy.

256
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,500
Least he got what he deserved.

257
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,958
We'll meet again in hell.

258
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:19,875
Huh?

259
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,791
[NINJA SLAYER, GENDOSO]
Huh?

260
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,333
[ALL]
Aaaargh!

261
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,458
[GENDOSO] Looks like
we'll have to run for it,

262
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,416
Ninja Slayer-san!
This way! Come!

263
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,250
[HUGESHURIKEN]
Aaaargh!

264
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,583
I know a safe place;
follow me!

265
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,250
[NINJA SLAYER grunts]
The dojo!

266
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,875
[NARRATOR]
Talk about overkill!

267
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,166
The Soukai have dropped
twenty-five megatons

268
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,583
of Banzai ba-boom onto the dojo!

269
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,541
Run, Ninja Slayer!
You've come too far!

270
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,458
Dozens of back-to-back
death-matches

271
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,000
have taken their toll
on Ninja Slayer's body.

272
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,208
He's nearing his limit.

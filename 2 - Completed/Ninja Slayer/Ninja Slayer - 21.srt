Well, of course, I've invested
billions upon billions

00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,750
into this city. It's just
a matter of common sense

34
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,958
that I'd want to personally
protect my investment

35
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,916
by making Neo-Saitama
great again.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,375

with my financial knowledge

The only thing that could
make this moment better

is if you kneel down and swear
your loyalty to the Soukaiya.

Laomoto-san is magnanimous.

00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,208
[MOTOR DOKURO] Piga-ga-gaah!
Pi-ga-ga-gaah! Piga-ga-gaah!

171
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,041
Pi-ga-ga-gaah!

172
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,291
[crashing]

173
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,333
[SAWATARI] I guess we can
get back to our battle.

174
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,875
So step up and get some!

175
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,125
[NINJA SLAYER]
Wait!

176
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,458
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

177
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,541
[SAWATARI]
What the--? Yeeart!

178
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,833
[YELLOW MOTOR DOKURO]
Domo. I am Motor Dokuro.

179
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,625
Ninja soul detected.

180
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,083
[RED MOTOR DOKURO]
Exterminate! Exterminate!

181
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:21,916
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,958
[RED MOTOR DOKURO]
Pigaah!

183
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:23,916
[YELLOW MOTOR DOKURO]
Exterminate!

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,875
Saigon!

185
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,000
[YELLOW MOTOR DOKURO]
Pigaah!

186
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,291
Yeeart!

187
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,666
[RED MOTOR DOKURO]
Pigaah!

188
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,041
[YELLOW MOTOR DOKURO]
Piga-ga-gaah! Exterminate!

189
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:34,875
[NINJA SLAYER]
Yeeart!

190
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,166
[RED MOTOR DOKURO]
Pigaah!

191
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,833
Yeeart!

192
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:39,875
[YELLOW MOTOR DOKURO]
Piga-ga-gaah!

193
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,625
Yeeart!

194
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:47,666
[YELLOW MOTOR DOKURO]
Piga-ga-gaah, gaah!

195
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,791
So now that Brezhnev's
robotic commie

196
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,041
goons are out of the picture.

197
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,500
Huh?

198
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,875
It's time for you and me to
settle the score, Ninja--

199
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,791
[groans]

200
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,375
[SAWATARI]
Slayer-san.

201
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,125
No...

202
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,416
[coughs]

203
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,708
Your heart is on the
opposite side, is it not?

204
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,625
Then I suppose you'll suffer
much more than a normal man.

205
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,875
[SAWATARI]
The hell?

206
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,083
All this time I've been
chasing down Charlie,

207
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,583
and he's standing right
behind me. Damnit.

208
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,250
Yeeart!

209
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,333
[DARKNINJA]
Yeeart!

210
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,500
[SAWATARI groans]

211
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:30,541
[SAWATARI grunts]

212
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,750
I can't fail the Survivor Dojo.

213
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,500
I still have to find
Ho Chi Minh's

214
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,708
secret treasure and
bring it back to them.

215
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,250
[SAWATARI]
Abbah!

216
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,125
[crashing]

217
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,791
[NINJA SLAYER]
Domo, Darkninja-san.

218
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,666
I've been waiting for the
time we'd meet again.

219
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,791
[DARKNINJA]
Domo, Ninja Slayer-san.

220
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,041
Please excuse the delay.

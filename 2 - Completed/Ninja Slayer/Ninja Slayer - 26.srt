[NARAKU]
Domo, Laomoto-san.

00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:14,541
I am Naraku Ninja.

00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,458
[LAOMOTO]
Domo, Naraku Ninja-san.

4
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:24,000
I am Laomoto Khan,
Demolition Ninja.

[LAOMOTO yells]

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,708
Impossible!

00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,625
[NARAKU]
Carnage!

11
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:33,625
[LAOMOTO]

12
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,041
[HELLKITE]
Abbah!

13
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,333
[LAOMOTO] I've never
seen a ninja soul burn

14
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,791
with such ferocity.

15
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,625
He's lost all control of it.

16

[NARAKU]
You miserable whelp!

19
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,541
[LAOMOTO]
This is absurd!

20
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,291
Where is this power coming from?

21
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,791
Who the hell are you?!

22
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,666
[NARAKU]
Absurdity kills reason!

23
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,416
My power flows from vengeance!

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,583
I am your karma!

25
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,666
[NARAKU yells]

26
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,625
[LAOMOTO]
Impossible!

[NARAKU yells]

28
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,291
This cannot be!

[LAOMOTO groans]

42
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,166
[NARAKU] He should be steaming
pile of guts right now!

43
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,041
I knew it; Fujikido's
body is too weak!

44
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,375
It won't let me unleash
all of my ninja power

45
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,208
on this gold-plated skid mark!

46
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:30,958
[NARAKU yells]

47
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:35,458
[LAOMOTO groaning]

48
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:38,250
[NARAKU]
Allow me to behead you!

49
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,541
[NARRATOR] Naraku Ninja
continues to lay the smack down

50
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,333
on the kingpin, Laomoto Khan.

51
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,458
But what has happened to

52
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,541
Fujikido Kenji-slash-Ninja
Slayer-san?

53
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,666
Is he still in there somewhere?

54
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,541
Ninja! Ninja!

55
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,000
Tochinoki sure is fascinated
by ninjas, huh?

56
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,750
He absolutely loves them.

57
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,541
That's good to know
for this Christmas.

58
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,666
Well, maybe,

59
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,083
you could get him
some throwing stars.

60
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,583
[NINJA SLAYER]
Stop! Please, stop!

61
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm a ninja!

62
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,541
Ninjas aren't real, sweetpea.

63
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,708
Well, maybe,

64
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,083
you could get him
some throwing stars.

65
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,541
I'm a ninja!

66
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,291
[NINJA SLAYER]
I can't take this anymore!

67
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,166
Ninjas aren't real, sweetpea.

68
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,083
Aren't real.

69
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,333
[NINJA SLAYER groaning]

70
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,291
[NARAKU] You've got some
brass balls, Fujikido!

71
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,375
But did you really believe
you had the strength

72
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,166
to burn through my
power like that?

73
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,458
You will never contain me!

74
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,458
Your body is mine,
now and forever!

Hellkite!

You worthless, flying
sack of excrement!

78
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,041
Do something!

79
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,666
[NARAKU]
I will exact vengeance

80
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,875
for your wife and
child, Fujikido!

81
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,750
You just lie there.

82
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,625
Writhing on the futon
in your mind.

83
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:52,041
Agonizing over your
impotence, for all eternity!

84
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:01,250

[NARAKU grunts]

86
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,333
[NARAKU]
Huh?

87
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,416
[NARAKU groans]

88
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,458
[NARAKU]
Has this pathetic human body

89
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,125
given me all that it has?

90
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,583
[LAOMOTO grunts, yells]

91
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,916
[NARAKU]
Damn you, Fujikido.

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,541
I know you're up to something.

93
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,708
Stop it!

94
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,708
[NINJA SLAYER inahles, exhales]

95
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,208
[FUYUKO]
Sweetie.

96
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,708
[TOCHINOKI]
Daddy.

97
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,541
[NARAKU]
Come on, Fujikido!

98
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,875
Let your rage burn!
That's how this works!

99
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,291
Fury is my gasoline!

100
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,625
We will never take
revenge for your family

101
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:03,083
unless your brain is
boiling with hatred!

102
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,916
[NINJA SLAYER]
Furinkazan.

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,416
Chado.

104
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,250
Don't stop.

105
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,250
Furinkazan.

106
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:19,541
[NARAKU] Are you trying
to get killed, you ninny?

107
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,916
[NINJA SLAYER]
Naraku Ninja,

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,166
you may be the housemate
of my neurons,

109
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,000
but you can't evict
me from my mind!

110
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,583
I realized something.

111
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,833
I, Fujikido Kenji, summoned
you that fateful day.

112
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,416
I hungered for blood,
and you fed me well!

113
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,000
But by summoning you,
I invited you in.

114
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,208
Two souls, living in one body.

115
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,500
And now I need your
strength, Naraku!

116
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,125
[NARAKU]
Such insolence!

117
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,541
You summon me, use me,
fight me tooth and nail,

118
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,708
and now you ask me for help?

119
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,000
[NINJA SLAYER]
Nay!

120
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,541
It was my rage, my burning
scream for vengeance

121
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,583
that summoned you from the
very depths of my soul.

122
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,416
I cannot deny you or
hide you anymore!

123
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,375
Naraku, I accept you!

124
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,416
You are the ninja inside
me that I cannot slay!

125
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,541
[NARRATOR] Fujikido had
discovered a zen-like truth

126
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,541
at the far end of his Chado.

127
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,291
Fujikido could not disavow
the raging bloodlust

128
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,333
deep within him.

129
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,875
Yet he could not
fall into its grip.

130
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,625
Fujikido had to accept it.

131
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,958
As he accepted the loss of
his beloved wife and son.

132
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,541
[LAOMOTO yells]

133
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,583

134
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,458
[LAOMOTO]
Huh?

00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,166
[NINJA SLAYER yells]

136
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,625
[NINJA SLAYER]
Wasshoi!

137
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,916
[LAOMOTO]
Wha...?

138
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,833
[NINJA SLAYER]
Laomoto-san! Come at me!

139
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,000
[NARRATOR] Ninja Slayer's
very appearance has changed.

140
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,375
A sure sign that he and
Naraku Ninja have indeed

141
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,958
become one in mind and body!

142
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,083
[LAOMOTO]
You don't know when to die!

143
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,875
[LAOMOTO grunting]

144
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,458
[NARAKU] This enemy soul is
from the Big Ninja Clan.

145
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,583
Power like a freight train,
but slow and clumsy.

146
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,875
I was hoping you'd say that!

[NARAKU]
Stop, Fujikido!

153
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,625
That's the classic strike
absorption stance

154
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,625
of the Itami Ninja Clan!

155
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,833
But those Itami fools have a
glaring hole in their defense.

156
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,041
Do you know what it is?

157
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,416
Damn straight!

158
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,208
[LAOMOTO]
Huh?

159
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,375
Ah! Impossible!

160
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,916
You may recognize my
seven ninja souls,

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,625
but you will never defeat me!

162
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,250
[NARAKU]
Now, Fujikido!

163
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,375
Finish him off with one shot!

[LAOMOTO]
Nnnnng!

167
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,541
[NARAKU] A move from
the Shrike Ninja Clan!

168

Throw yourself at me head on!

176
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,333
Why run from the inevitable

177
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,958
when you can die
before your life

178
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,833
is completely ruled by pain?

[NARAKU]
Fujikido!

182
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,791
Hand over your body!

183
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,458
Take it! Now!

184
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,625
[NARAKU yells]

185
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,208
[LAOMOTO]
Mmmm!

186
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,875
[NARAKU]
Carnage!

187
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,708
[HELLKITE yells]

188

[HELLKITE]
Aieee!

191
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,666
[NARAKU]
Look down!

192
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,208
Right beneath your feet!

193
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,708
He's losing his
situational awareness!

194
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,375
[LAOMOTO exhales]

195
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,625
[NINJA SLAYER]
What?

196
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,750
[HELLKITE] Prepare for
Laomoto-san's judgment!

197
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,625
[NINJA SLAYER]
Let go!

198
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,000
[NARAKU]
Damnit, Fujikido!

199
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,750
If he hits you with those
massive karate missiles,

200
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,875
your body has no chance
of surviving the trauma.

201
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,666
Our only hope is for me
to use all of my power

202
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,583
to defend us from the onslaught!

203
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,416
[LAOMOTO]
And now, I'll seal the deal!

204
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,666
[LAOMOTO yells]

205
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,375
[NARAKU]
We're out of time!

206
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,708
What are you doing? Naraku?

207
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,291
[HELLKITE]
Abbah! Sorry boss!

208
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,791
Banzai!

209
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,416

00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,916
[LAOMOTO]
Victory!

214
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,666
But of course, I am
Demolition Ninja.

215
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,833
True Leader of the
Soukai Six Gates!

216
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,666
You never had a chance
of beating me.

217
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,625
Death is... the only way out.

218
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:07,458

Death is the only way out!

224
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:28,791
You win.

225
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:29,666
[NINJA SLAYER]
Huh?

226
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,750
I am beaten.

227
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,500
Anything you want,

228
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,416
I will give you.

229
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
You want to buy your
way out of death?

230
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,666
Listen, if you let me live,

231
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,916
I'll give you whatever you want.

232
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,125
The only thing that I want...

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,375
[NINJA SLAYER]
...is for you to die!

234
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:02,416
Wasshoi!

235
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,916
Death is the only way
out for ninjas! [yells]

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,833
[LAOMOTO screams]

237
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,458
[LAOMOTO]
Damn you, Ninja Slayer-san,

238
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,666
I offered you anything,
and you took everything!

239
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,041
It's bad business!

240
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:30,208
Sayonara!

241
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:45,708
[NINJA SLAYER grunts]

242
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,500
[NINJA SLAYER gasps]

243
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,083
You're finally awake.

244
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,333
Where am I?

245
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,375
And how did I get here?

246
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,541
I bet you ask those questions
more than most people.

247
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,375
All you need to know right
now is that you're safe.

248
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,958
You can rest.

249
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,166
Laomoto.

250
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,416
[AGATA] Whatever you've
been going through...

251
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,583
it's over.

252
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,125
How do you know?

253
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,041
I just know, okay?

254
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,791
It's all over.

255
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,416
The nightmare is over?

256
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,333
[AGATA] It's the morning
of a brand new day.

257
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,666
You can leave all that pain
and suffering in your past.

258
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,083
Focus on building
your life again.

259
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,000
[NINJA SLAYER]
Rebuild my life.

260
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,083
[AGATA]
Yes. The pain is over.

261
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,708
It's time to heal.

262
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,708
Of course, you'll have more
than your fair share of scars.

263
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,708
But those will only serve
as proof of your healing.

264
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,833
I have to rebuild my life.

265
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,166
Fuyuko.

266
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,875

268
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,666
Nancy-san?

269
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,250
[NANCY]
Rise and shine.

270
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,833
[NINJA SLAYER] This is what's
left of the castle keep, right?

271
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,166
[NINJA SLAYER]
I'm still here.

272
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,708
I guess I was dreaming.

273
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,916
[NANCY] I gave you a
shot of ZBR adrenaline.

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,750
Sorry if you're a naturalist or
whatever, but it's all I had.

275
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,625
[NINJA SLAYER]
No.

276
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,541
Thank you.

277
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,291
You saved my life.

278
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,583
What time is it?

279
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,708
[NANCY]
It's getting close to daybreak.

280
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,166
[NINJA SLAYER]
Is it all over now?

281
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,166
Is Laomoto-san dead?

282
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,916
[NINJA SLAYER]
Hm?

283
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,791
[NINJA SLAYER]
I see.

284
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,375
You truly do reap what you sow.

285
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,833
[NANCY]
Yep.

286
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,750
But we really don't have to
time to wax philosophical.

287
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,166
Time to GTFO.

288
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:29,791
[NINJA SLAYER]
Huh?

289
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,958
[NANCY]
What?!

290
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,041
I don't know what's happening.

291
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,708
It definitely wasn't
part of the plan.

292
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,291

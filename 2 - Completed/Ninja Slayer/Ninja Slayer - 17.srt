1
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:05,000
[YAMOTO] I'm so tired. But I
know they'll be coming after me.

2
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,666
Can't sleep. Have to
be ready for them.

3
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,416
I have to stay awake.
Have to stay--

4
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,041
[door clatters, slams]

5
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,208
[grunts]

6
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:25,250
[footsteps]

7
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,791
[YAMOTO]
Huh?

8
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,166
[gasps]

9
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,416
[YAMATO shouts]

10
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,583
[GENOCIDE]
Ah, you're a ninja. Interesting.

11
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,208
Domo. I am Yamoto Koki.

12
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,041
[GENOCIDE]
Domo. I am Genocide.

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,625
Start talkin', small fry.
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,291
Did the Soukaiya send you?

15
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:55,791
Give me a little credit, kid.
I'm not some kind of monster.

16
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,791
Did 'ya come here to fight me?
Your karate against mine?

17
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,125
Winner buries the loser?

18
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,708
Sounds like fun.

19
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,541
Wait...

20
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,416
Shi? Shi Ninja?

21
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
[YAMOTO]
Huh?

22
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,583
Forget about it.

23
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,458
[GENOCIDE] My brains are
like pudding these days.

24
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,416
I don't know what
I'm talkin' about.

25
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,708
[gasps]

26
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,666
So, uh. What are you doing?

27
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,083
[GENOCIDE]
Burying her.

28
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,916
Don't want her to get
all rotten, and nasty like me.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,208
Nobody wants that.

30
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,958
Who is she?

31
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,833
When she was alive, she was
the lady that lived here.

32
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,708
Kicked her oxygen habit, though.

33
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,333
Old age'll do that.

34
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,125
Found her in there.
All by her lonesome.

35
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,458
And it's too late for company,
so here we are.

36
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,500
[sighs]

37
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,458
Why can't I catch
that dead, green oaf?

38
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,208
Genocide was my creation!

39
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,041
A fearsome,
mindless zombie ninja!

40
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,416
But he just had to become
self-aware and go on a rampage.

41
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,333
Destroying my lab and running
away like a rabid dog!

42
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,125
I must capture him soon,
no matter what the cost may be!

43
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,208
All this worry and stress
is keeping me awake

44
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,333
at night and if it stays like
this for very much longer,

45
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,750
I'm afraid it's going to
drive me completely insane!

46
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,500
Oh no, doctor,
we can't risk anything

47
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,458
bad happening to your big,
throbbing, brain!

48
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,750
However, there is one bright
spot in all of this, Fubuki-kun!

49
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,333
He is a truly amazing ninja!

50
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,875
My creation, my Genocide,
cannot be stopped!

51
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,875
I'm so unbelievably
proud of him!

52
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,750
I made him! He's my son!
My baby boy!

53
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,000
Be careful doctor!

54
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,000
You need to get those
emotions under control!

55
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,333
That's why I created
a sweet little ninja

56
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,000
of my very own to capture him!

57
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:42,750
Huh?

58
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,875
[beeping]

59
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,875
[LEE] Hmm? You did
this all without me?

60
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,916
Manticore, eh?
Okay! I'll take it!

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,833
I have also pinpointed the
exact location where Genocide

62
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,000
has been hiding recently.

63
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,166
That's amazing! You clever fox!

64
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,875
[FUBUKI giggles]
Ah, just a moment.

65
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,333
It seems a Soukaiya ninja

66
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,791
has also been deployed
to the same area.

67
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,166
[shower hisses]

68
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,125
[gasps]

69
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,833
[alarm buzzes]

70
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,208
[alarm buzzes]

71
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:34,833
Hey, your name.
It's uh, Yamoto, right?

72
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,041
So what's your story?

73
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,750
Just the Soukaiya is looking
to kill ya, and that's it?

74
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,750
[YAMOTO]
Mm-hmm.

75
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,833
I've got enemies, too.

76
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,458
Imagine they'll find
me sooner or later.

77
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,083
[sighs]
You want a slug, kid?

78
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,375
[YAMOTO]
Mm-mm.

79
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,916
[YAMOTO]
I'll share it with you.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,708
[GENOCIDE]
Naw, I'm good.

81
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,583
[YAMOTO]
So. Were you a priest?

82
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,833
I mean, when you...

83
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,833
[GENOCIDE] Ha! Do I look
like a priest to you?

84
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:22,333
Oh, the outfit. Came with
the place. Seems to fit okay.

85
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,833
Don't really remember
what I was before.

86
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,791
Told ya my brain's a pile
of mush. I forget stuff.

87
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,291
[YAMOTO] I wonder what happened
to the priest. Did he leave?

88
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,333
[GENOCIDE]
No idea.

89
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,875
[gasps]

90
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:47,958
[GENOCIDE]
You look like you need a nap.

91
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,708
When's the last time ya slept?

92
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,000
[YAMOTO]
I'll be fine.

93
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,583
Get some sleep.
I don't need it, myself.

94
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,791
I'll keep watch, okay?

95
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,083
--[YAMOTO] Mm-hmm.
--[rustling]

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,333
[GENOCIDE]
Hm?

97
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,625
Hey, there's a bed
in the room upstairs.

98
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,666
Probably be more comfortable.

99
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,000
[YAMOTO]
Mm-hmm.

100
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,375

[GENOCIDE] Get up!
We've got company!

103
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,250
Go to the tower and
see what's going on!

104
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,791
They're coming.

105
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,208
Lots of them!

Exterminate! Exterminate!

107

Gouranga!

113
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,958
Like a swarm of
abandoned space probes,

114
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,500
plunging into an asteroid belt,

115
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,166
the hapless Yakuza clones can
do nothing but move forward!

[MANTICORE]

179
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,083
[GENOCIDE yells]

180
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,500
You zombie! You weak!

181
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:08,916
Me test muscle power. No way
me can lose to weak zombie!

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,166
Me kill you, take body,
then go back home!

183
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,666
Never gonna happen.

184
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,416
[chains clinking]

185
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,458

[MANTICORE]

187
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:27,125
Gwaagh!

188
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:31,166
[GENOCIDE] You can't
kill me! Because, I am...

189
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,791
...Genocide!

190
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,958
[MANTICORE]
Abbah! Sayonara!

191
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,083
Huh? Aah!

192
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,500
Not even Manticore
could capture him?

193
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,125
I'm a bad girl, doctor!

194
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,250
I should've communicated
with the Sokaiya beforehand!

195
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,750
I'm not mad at you!

196
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,000
Just look at all this
beautiful combat data

197
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,250
we were able to accumulate
from my Genocide!

198
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,291
What I wouldn't give to have
him back! It makes me crazy!

199
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,500
[FUBUKI, LEE grunting]

200
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,666
[LEE] Genocide will
exterminate everything!

201
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,333
I must have him! I need him!

202
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,458
I can't take it!
Oh, I'm gonna go crazy!

203
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,041
I need him! I need him, dammit!

204
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,375
I can't take it! Agrh!

205

--[LEE] I'm gonna lose it!
--[FUBUKI] Oh, Doctor!

206
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,375
There's gonna be more of them.

207
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,291
So you should bail while
you still have the chance.

208
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,750
[sighs]

209
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,125
If I see you...

210
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,666
Did I tell ya my brains
are like pudding?

211
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,750
If we do happen to
see each other again

212
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,375
and I don't recognize ya,
don't be mad.

213
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,666
[YAMOTO]
Okay.

214
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,666

1
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:09,839
Oooh!

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,542
[Koshi]:
We have a banner?

3
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:15,678
Y..you can do it.

4
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:23,386
[Upperclassmen]:
(loud sobbing)

5
00:00:23,486 --> 00:00:26,956
[Kei]:
What the hell?!
Calm down already!

6
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:27,857
We can win!

7
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:30,193
The first round
is all ours!

8
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:31,728
Yeah!

9
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:38,601
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

10
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:54,117
Huh?

11
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:56,953
Hey.

12
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:10,667
So... looks like
it's time for‐

13
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:12,269
Don't say it.
Uh..do not say it.

14
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,371
You were about to start
talking about something

15
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,039
really sappy,
weren't you?

16
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:19,476
Yeah, something about this
being our last tournament...

17
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:21,611
Who wants to hear
that crap?

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,416
I guess this shall truly
be our last tournament.

19
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,351
Yeah.

20
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:29,752
It's so crazy...

21
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:32,189
We've all been through
so much together.

22
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:34,791
That kind of talk
makes me feel like

23
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:36,826
we're planning for it
to be over. Stop it!

24
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:38,895
Aw come on, what's
so bad about it?!

25
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:41,498
I had this whole big plan
to boost you guys' morale

26
00:01:41,598 --> 00:01:44,101
yesterday, by getting all of
the third‐year players together

27
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:47,270
after practice for a quiet
talk under the stars,

28
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,638
so we could get ready...

29
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:50,373
But then you guys
just up and left!

30
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:52,609
That surprise from Kiyoko
more than doubled

31
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,311
the team's
morale though.

32
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:56,279
Well... yeah...

33
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:59,049
I guess that's
true, but...

34
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,951
[Koshi]:
All we need to worry about today
is winning the first two rounds

35
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:03,886
so we can make it
to day two.

36
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:06,723
I don't want to talk like
the year is finished.

37
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:09,526
Let's just play
the game... and win it!

38
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:11,894
[Daichi]:
Don't sweat
the other stuff.

39
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:13,596
Yeah.

40
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:15,098
[Daichi]:
We're counting
on you, Ace...

41
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:17,167
[Shoyo]:
Morning!
Just... play hard.

42
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,769
Daichi being nice
is freaking me out.

43
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:21,738
Yeah, it doesn't
suit him does it.

44
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:24,874
Oh I'm sorry, I can be
mean if that works better.

45
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:26,509
[Shoyo]:
Good morning!

46
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:27,444
[Tobio]:
Morning!

47
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:29,112
Hey!

48
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:32,682
Good morning! We'll unlock
the room for ya.

49
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,317
Time to go.

50
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,852
Yep!

51
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:16,753
[Shibuya]:
What do you think
Karasuno's like?

52
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:19,156
Hopefully... they're
not a bunch of giants.

53
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:21,358
[Chaya]:
Eh, don't worry
about it, man.

54
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,260
I heard they haven't
been too hot recently.

55
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,962
[OFU Member 1]:
Shiratorizawa's
gonna clean house.

56
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:28,831
Nah, Aoba Johsai's a
bigger threat this year.

57
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,800
Now that Oikawa's a
third‐year, they're even

58
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,669
tougher than
they were before.

59
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,472
Plus their first‐years
are improving really fast.

60
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:37,274
But, that's
Seijoh for ya.

61
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:38,975
Eh... I dunno...

62
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:41,478
Y'think they can win the
block against Date Tech?

63
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:44,081
All I know, is I'm glad
they're not in Block A.

64
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:47,950
Let's see...
Who is in Block A?

65
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:50,020
[OFU Member 2]:
What does the
kanji say?

66
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,023
[OFU Member 1]:
Karasuno? Oh, yeah!
They might have a shot.

67
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:54,691
Aren't they supposed
to be tough?

68
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,993
[OFU Member 2]:
Yeah, a few years
ago, maybe...

69
00:04:57,094 --> 00:04:59,196
Now they suck so bad they've
even got a lame nickname.

70
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:01,331
[OFU Member 1]:
Oh really? So, then,
what are they called?

71
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:04,501
[OFU Member 2]:
Uh, something about how
they're fallen champions.

72
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:07,170
Oh! "The Wingless Crows."

73
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:13,176
Maybe you should
keep it down.

74
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:16,779
What did you just say?!
"Wingless crows?" Well‐

75
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,616
Cut it out, now...
I'm really sorry.

76
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:20,850
Uh, it's cool.

77
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,485
Do I need to
get you a leash?

78
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:23,486
Ugh... no...

79
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,095
[Attendee 1]:
They're kinda scary.

80
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:34,397
[Attendee 2]:
That guy looks like
a grown man.

81
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:36,866
Wait! Is that who
I think it is?!

82
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:39,136
Yeah, that's Asahi!

83
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,838
Wait... what?...
Who's that?

84
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:43,740
You mean you
don't know?!

85
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,009
[Brown‐haired Student]:
He made his goons beat
up some guys from North High.

86
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:48,045
Let's teach these
fools a lesson.

87
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,147
Oh no, a fight!
Stay here!

88
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,282
I'll go call
the authorities!

89
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:55,352
[Brown‐haired Student]:
Then he got caught selling
stuff on the street.

90
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:56,886
Fifty thousand.

91
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:59,222
Miss, did you drop
your handkerchief?

92
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:00,590
I'm so sorry!

93
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,759
[Brown‐haired Student]:
He got held
back five years.

94
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:04,427
[Black‐haired Student]:
Dude, he's old!

95
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:07,230
Oh boy, here we
go again, Daichi.

96
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,066
It's hard to avoid that
with your looks.

97
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,801
Wh‐what's the matter
with the way I look?!

98
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:13,736
I'm a taller guy, so
what's wrong with me wanting

99
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,372
to look all tough
and wild?!

100
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:18,475
Okay, yeah, you see...
Nobody who's tough or wild

101
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:20,510
would ever say
that, dude.

102
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:22,512
(laughs)

103
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:25,882
What's the big deal, dude?
Who cares how you look?

104
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:29,686
See, this is what
wild looks like.

105
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:31,154
[Attendee]:
Hey, check that out.

106
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:33,890
I guess the banner
really did the trick.

107
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,492
Do you really think so?

108
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:37,827
I mean, it did a lot more
good than anything I said.

109
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:39,029
She is smokin'...

110
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:40,430
Hey, I dare you
to talk to her.

111
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,665
Oh man, you think
she could handle it.

112
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,638
Cut that out.

113
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:49,972
She just hit me...

114
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:51,208
That was awesome...

115
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:53,343
Hey, see that short
guy over there?

116
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,645
[Brown‐haired Student]:
I think that's Nishinoya
from Chidoriyama.

117
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:58,515
He won "best libero"
back in middle school.
That's all the strength I need!

118
00:06:58,615 --> 00:06:59,949
Whoa... really?

119
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,252
And that's not all.
Y'see that guy there?

120
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:03,753
He's that scary‐looking
setter dude

121
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:05,688
that everyone's been
talking about.

122
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:09,059
[Brown‐haired Student]:
The King of the Court
from Kitagawa First!

123
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:13,930
[Black‐haired Student]:
But why Karasuno?

124
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,398
[Brown‐haired Student]:
Beats me...

125
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:17,534
I heard he got a bad rep
in middle school though,

126
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:18,735
so maybe that's why.

127
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:20,737
Okay, then who's
the carrot top?

128
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:23,606
[Black‐haired Student]:
Is he some kind
of living legend too?

129
00:07:23,706 --> 00:07:25,508
Whoa!

130
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:29,512
Um... I don't
think so...

131
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:31,414
He's weird.

132
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:34,317
[Shoyo]:
Wow, there's
so many people!

133
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:36,353
Hey, the summit!

134
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:38,655
That's exactly
where I'm headed!

135
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:40,657
Stay outta my way!

136
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:42,459
What's with you?!

137
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,961
You can't say things like that!
I'm so sorry he's a little off!

138
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:46,429
Okay...

139
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:50,000
This place is huge!

140
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,604
It smells like Air Salonpas!

141
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,306
What are you
talking about?

142
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:59,042
That is what makes a tournament
smell like a real tournament!

143
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:00,910
I know, right?!
Mm‐hm...

144
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:03,613
[Attendee 1]:
They're here!
[Attendee 2]:
Whoa, they're tall!

145
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:11,121
[Attendee 2]:
It's Date Tech!

146
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:14,624
Where are his eyebrows?!

147
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:23,600
Who the hell are y‐

148
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:33,743
[Moniwa]:
Hey! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, dude!

149
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:34,977
Please don't do that!...

150
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:37,547
I am so sorry
about him, everybody!

151
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,482
Um, can I get
a little help here!

152
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:42,252
Yeah, yeah, please excuse
our giant friend here.

153
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:44,521
He has a way of automatically
picking out the ace

154
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:46,456
on every team he sees.

155
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:49,259
[Futakuchi]:
Anyway... hope
you're ready...

156
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,328
'cause you're about
to lose miserably.

157
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:53,663
[Moniwa]:
Why do you guys always
have to be so rude?

158
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:56,833
That's not good
sportsmanship at all!

159
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,101
Well that
was something...

160
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:59,936
I wasn't really
sure how to respond.

161
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:01,438
Yeah.

162
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:04,441
I'm impressed you were
able to look him in the eye‐

163
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,976
Oh man... That
was really scary.

164
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:08,678
How are you a badass
on the court

165
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:09,879
but a wimp
everywhere else?

166
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:12,049
Damn Noya,
that was cold!

167
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,151
[Ikejiri]:
Sawamura.

168
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:15,652
Been a while.

169
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:18,955
Oh, Ikejiri! Hey, uh...
I'll catch you guys later!

170
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:20,690
[Team Karasuno]:
Okay, see ya!

171
00:09:21,891 --> 00:09:23,326
[Daichi]:
Long time, no see.

172
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:26,596
[Ikejiri]:
Yeah... You look
bigger now.

173
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:29,132
[Daichi]:
Really? I'm the same
height as before.

174
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:30,900
Uh, that's not
what I meant.

175
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,169
So I'm fatter?!

176
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,472
No, not that.

177
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:38,875
[Ikejiri]:
His build is different,
and he looks more intense.

178
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:42,212
I'm sure he's
training harder too.

179
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:44,347
I saw you at the entrance
a while ago...

180
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,217
but I was too intimidated to
say something to you.

181
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:49,052
Wait what,
are you serious?

182
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:51,254
Well no, I understand.
I guess some of our guys

183
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:52,922
don't look very
approachable, do they?

184
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:57,494
It's just... they all seem
really tough... And so do you.

185
00:09:57,594 --> 00:09:58,861
You think so?

186
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:02,699
The thing is, my school
has kind of a small‐time team.

187
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:07,037
Listen uh‐

188
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:08,505
Wait, forget
I said that!

189
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:10,507
Look, it doesn't matter
how big we are...

190
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:12,875
or how big we
used to be...

191
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:14,411
'Cause we're
here now, so...

192
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:16,779
fact is, we're gonna wipe
the floor with you!

193
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:27,057
[Chizuru]:
I'm so nervous!

194
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:28,658
[Manami]:
I know. Me too.

195
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:31,028
Was it just me, or were
their spikes really on point

196
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:32,295
during practice
before?

197
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:34,497
Yeah they did make
the top 8 last year...

198
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:37,300
Well, maybe hopefully we
won't get matched with them!

199
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,570
[Chizuru]:
We should have showed up
to morning practice more.

200
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:45,642
[Daichi]:
Remember... it doesn't
matter how strong or talented

201
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:50,813
your opponent is.
You won't win unless you try.

202
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:55,252
If you look back now...
we had more than enough time.

203
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:57,954
[Yui]:
We could have practiced
a lot more than we did.

204
00:10:58,055 --> 00:11:00,357
We didn't have our
priorities straight.

205
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:02,092
Yeah well it's too
late for that, Yui‐

206
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:04,361
But none of that matters now!

207
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:07,497
We've got 45 minutes 'til
the starting whistle blows.

208
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:10,467
All we can do now is make sure
we're properly warmed up,

209
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:14,237
then play to the best of our
ability 'til the very end!

210
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:17,807
And maybe... we can win!

211
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:23,246
Gather 'round, everyone...
Let's huddle!

212
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:27,517
You heard the
Captain, ladies!

213
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:28,751
What?

214
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,789
Karasunoooo... fight!

215
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:34,424
Yeah!

216
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,766
Hinata... You better not
be about to puke again.

217
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,335
No! I'm mediating!

218
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:47,004
What is that
supposed to mean?!

219
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,538
Um, I think he means
"meditating".

220
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:51,008
Nah... Looks like
he might pee himself.

221
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:53,676
You must be freaked out over
what happened with Date Tech.

222
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:56,779
I‐I no‐ I'm NOT freaked out,
I'm just finding my chi.

223
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,980
[Ryunosuke]:
Your chi?!

224
00:11:58,081 --> 00:11:59,749
Oh great...

225
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,051
He's losing it...

226
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,920
We're gonna have
to do something fast.

227
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:07,657
[Tobio]:
Or else it'll be the
Seijoh game all over again.

228
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,128
Wow, Asahi, you're just
as much of a coward,

229
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:12,895
but you don't seem
to be that nervous.

230
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:14,664
He just called
me a coward?

231
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:17,634
Well I have a trick for
getting rid of pre‐game jitters.

232
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:20,203
Just think about something
totally awful that happened

233
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:21,304
in your past...

234
00:12:21,404 --> 00:12:23,040
The more terrifying
the better.

235
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,742
[Asahi]:
And then you think, "This isn't
the worst thing there is;

236
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:27,377
I can handle it."

237
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:31,181
Something in my past
that was really scary.

238
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:35,718
Hmm... Hmm... Hmm...

239
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,260
Hm? Hinata?

240
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,395
Yup... I think
I'll be okay.

241
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:47,230
Snap out of it,
we need you!

242
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,299
If you had this
amazing coping strategy,

243
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,068
then why did you get all
bent out of shape last time

244
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:53,336
we played
Date Tech?

245
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,438
Listen Noya, that's the
kind of thing you think

246
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:57,074
but don't actually
say, understand?

247
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:59,476
Uh, well I didn't really have
time to think of anything

248
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:01,544
scary that day.
I couldn't concentrate,

249
00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:04,247
and it takes a lot of effort to
come up with the mental image!

250
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:05,748
You guys get that, right?

251
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:07,650
Lame excuse.

252
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,552
Everybody ready?

253
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:12,589
This is our first game...
Now, let's go get warmed up.

254
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,357
Right!

255
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:16,526
It's finally happening!

256
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:50,893
[Shoyo]:
Whoaaaaa!

257
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:52,962
This place... It's huge!

258
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:56,066
Could you pick your jaw up
off the floor, please?

259
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,267
You're too serious!

260
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,835
At least I'm not
having a freak‐out!

261
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:01,638
H‐Hey, let me
go, Kageyama!

262
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:15,485
Ready, boys?... 'Bout time to
get in a few practice reps!

263
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:17,354
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

264
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,025
[Irihata]:
Let's go get a
closer look at 'em.

265
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,427
I want to see those
two Karasuno first‐years

266
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:26,329
do that quick
attack of theirs.

267
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:27,497
Yeah.

268
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:32,535
Aoba Johsai's here.

269
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:34,037
Man, those guys
are tall...

270
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:36,073
They look like they're
pretty tough, too.

271
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:38,841
Well it depends; a big
part of how good a team is,

272
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:41,911
is their setter...
Wait, where is he?

273
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:45,915
Where'd Oikawa go?

274
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,484
Uhhh...
he's uh...

275
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:49,419
Tell us; we
don't have all day!

276
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,756
Wow you're
like so tall!
Yeah, and you're
so handsome too!

277
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:56,726
Iwaizumi.

278
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:58,028
Got it.

279
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:02,865
These are amazing!
You really made them yourself?

280
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:05,468
Yeah, I stayed up really
late last night baking!

281
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:08,171
Well that makes me feel
really special; thank you.

282
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,672
Ah! I‐It was nothing!

283
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:12,009
Could I please take a quick
photo with you, Oikawa?

284
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:15,312
You want a picture of me?
Absolutely‐ ahhh!

285
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,947
(shrieking)

286
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:19,249
Poor Oikawa!

287
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:23,120
Unbelievable! Not even
the coach has ever HIT me!

288
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,827
Sorry ladies, have to take a
rain check on that photo.

289
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:32,662
Aww...

290
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,835
[Shoyo]:
It's onion head!

291
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,837
What the hell's
an onion head?

292
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:42,905
You're the only one
it could be.

293
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:43,606
Huh?!

294
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:45,542
[Toru]:
Yoo‐hoo!

295
00:15:46,343 --> 00:15:47,744
Kageyama and Small Fry!

296
00:15:47,844 --> 00:15:50,480
How's that cute little
combo move comin' along?

297
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,649
[Shoyo]:
Great King!

298
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:54,917
Would you please
stop doing that?

299
00:15:55,018 --> 00:16:00,857
[Toru]:
So you got a libero. He wasn't
with you at the practice game.
Throw me one more!

300
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:03,460
[Hajime]:
I think that
big guy's new, too.
I want to try that again!

301
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,162
Hey...

302
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:07,664
That coach... I don't think I've
ever seen him around before.

303
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:09,299
Make every second count!

304
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,933
Ginger, move your ass!

305
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:12,202
O‐Okay!

306
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:14,237
So they have new players
and a new coach to boot...

307
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:18,208
Wonder if that means Karasuno's
improved their game, any.

308
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:21,578
[Takeda]:
Well, today's the day.

309
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:23,113
I can't believe it...

310
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:26,316
our team's about to play here...
in this giant venue.

311
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:30,453
It's making me... nervous just
watching from the sidelines.

312
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:32,789
But that's why...

313
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,258
it's important to do
everything we can,

314
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:37,060
to the best
of our ability.

315
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,595
Yes.

316
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:40,263
And... go!

317
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:42,565
[Shoyo]:
I'm ready!

318
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:44,734
Date Tech...

319
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,736
[Yu]:
Asahi!

320
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,138
[Shoyo]:
Right here!

321
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:49,572
Listen I'm worried
about Date Tech too...

322
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:51,174
but I won't be defeated...

323
00:16:51,274 --> 00:16:54,077
Because my mind's on
victory... And remember...

324
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:55,745
[Shoyo]:
Got it!

325
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:59,149
We have to remain focused
on the opponents in front of us.

326
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:00,283
Yeah.

327
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:03,253
Captains!

328
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:08,991
Thank you for the game.
Thank you for the game.

329
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,302
Alright, you guys!

330
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:20,970
[Daichi]:
Line up!

331
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,751
[Contestants]:
Thank you for the game!

332
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:16,593
Go, go, Date Tech,
Date Tech, here we go!

333
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:19,996
Go, go, Date Tech,
Date Tech, here we go!

334
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:23,766
Go, go, Date Tech,
Date Tech, here we go!

335
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:25,502
It's the first
game of the season.

336
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:28,105
And that kinda pressure can
make anybody nervous enough

337
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:31,408
to throw off their game. So our
job is to shake the nerves off

338
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:32,909
quicker than they do.

339
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,277
The best way to get in
the groove is to score

340
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:35,645
the first
point!

341
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:37,347
[Team Karasuno]:
Sir!

342
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:39,682
I don't say this to flatter
you guys; I really mean it.

343
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:42,152
[Takeda]:
You are all very talented.

344
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:43,553
We've got a great team!

345
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:47,790
Let's show this whole stadium...
these crows can still fly!

346
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,460
Whoa! Take's making
a big speech!

347
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,563
I bet those jerks still call us
by that dumb nickname...

348
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:56,033
Man, they don't know
how wrong they are.

349
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:59,002
People call them
the Wingless Crows.

350
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:00,937
It's time to
stand up and say...

351
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,374
That's not true anymore!
The old warhorse is back!

352
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:06,876
Yessir!

353
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:08,945
Wait! Was that
too cheesy?! I'll stop!

354
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:10,813
No, no, no!
That was great!

355
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:12,549
Hey, what's
an old warhorse?

356
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,451
I never understand
what he says.

357
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:17,320
I think what Takeda was trying
to say was that we were known

358
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,788
for being stronger
in the past.

359
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:20,857
Can we just
worry about today?!

360
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:24,094
[Daichi]:
Karasunooo, fight!

361
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:26,129
Fight!

362
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:29,299
[Toko Coach]:
Just get that
first point, boys.

363
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:30,633
Don't lose your head...

364
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,469
All that practice
is going to pay off.

365
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,604
[Toko Coach]:
And don't forget to
watch those receives.

366
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:36,539
Yessir!

367
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:39,942
[Tamagawa]:
No way! That little Number 10
is their middle‐blocker?!

368
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:43,013
I bet he can't be any
taller than 5 foot 5.

369
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:45,682
Why do they have those
taller guys on the bench?

370
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:48,518
Hilarious... Those guys
look totally confused...

371
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:50,620
And well, I guess
they should be.

372
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,091
[Hajime]:
The middle blocker position
is usually all about height.

373
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:57,194
Is that short guy part
of their starting lineup?

374
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:58,728
He's not a libero...

375
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:00,830
Laugh now, but you'll
pay the price later.

376
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,333
(laughs) Well, you
would know, wouldn'tcha?

377
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:05,968
I am not letting him make
a fool of me next time.

378
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:08,338
(starting whistle)

379
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:10,440
Here we go!

380
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,375
[Ikejiri]:
Your serve, Komaki!

381
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:13,610
Asahi!

382
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,944
Got it!

383
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:16,913
First shot...
Where do I send it?

384
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:19,749
Who can intimidate the other
team and boost our morale?

385
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:22,219
What is the best move
to start the game?!

386
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,454
I know... Perfect!

387
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:26,889
Awww yeahhhh!

388
00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:33,196
Nice one‐

389
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:36,899
Okay, you can
stop now‐

390
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,836
SHUT UP! NOW!

391
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,673
Karasuno already got
themselves a warning!

392
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:45,408
Wow, these guys
are a freakin' joke.

393
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:49,012
Hey, don't sweat it! Switch
gears and pay these guys back!

394
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:50,813
Yeah, take
back that point!

395
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:52,049
(whistle)

396
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:53,783
[Daichi]:
Take it to
'em, Tanaka!

397
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:56,086
[Spectator]:
Pshhh, good luck,
cue‐ball!

398
00:20:56,186 --> 00:20:56,986
Here!

399
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:57,687
[Tamagawa]:
Nice receive!

400
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:58,988
Ikejiri!

401
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:05,662
How did he even
get to that ball?!

402
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:07,297
That libero's
got reflexes!

403
00:21:07,397 --> 00:21:10,133
Damn, it's too far
from the setter!

404
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,201
Here, Asahi!

405
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,336
Alright, Here comes
the left! Triple up!

406
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:15,172
It's up to you, Ace!

407
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:20,977
(cheers)

408
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:23,146
[Spectator 1]:
Damn, that's
a grown‐ass man!

409
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:25,215
[Spectator 2]:
I hear he's been
held back 5 times!

410
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:26,983
[Spectator 1]:
He's gotta be
at least 30!

411
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,918
[Spectator 2]:
That's crazy.

412
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:31,221
Try not to let it
get to you, Asahi!

413
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:35,125
No way... Did you
see that momentum?

414
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:36,293
Uh‐huh.

415
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:38,961
That's right, don't mess
with our left side!

416
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:43,433
[Keishin]:
Oh, and... that's not the only
weapon we've got up our sleeves.

417
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,502
(evil cackle)

418
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:48,805
Don't you dare
wimp out on me!

419
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:50,073
(whistle)

420
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:52,442
[Daichi]:
Same thing again, Tanaka!

421
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,111
I'm open!

422
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:58,448
You're all very talented...
We've got a great team!

423
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,089
[Takeda]:
Let's show this whole stadium...

424
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:09,126
These crows can still fly!

425
00:22:24,674 --> 00:22:26,176
He's flying.

426
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:40,923
[Takeda]:
Alright...

427
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:42,959
Prepare yourselves...

428
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:51,134
...for the Karasuno warhorse!

429
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:24,594
[Shoyo]:
It's finally time, guys!

430
00:24:24,694 --> 00:24:26,663
[Ryunosuke]:
Listen carefully,
young one...

431
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:29,299
[Yu]:
In Sendai, Miyagi
Prefecture...

432
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:31,834
[Ryunosuke]:
When someone says
"the old warhorse"...

433
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:33,536
[Ryunosuke/Yu]:
They mean Karasuno!

434
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:36,706
[Shoyo]:
Next Haikyu!!
"Winner and Loser."

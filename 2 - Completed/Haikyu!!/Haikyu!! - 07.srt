1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,353
[IRIHATA] Hey...
Welcome back, Oikawa.
[TOBIO] (uncertainty)

2
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:10,789
[IRIHATA]
How's that leg doing?

3
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:17,162
Never been better! Glad I can
come back to practice now...

4
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:18,897
It was just a tiny sprain.

5
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:21,834
Listen, son... Don't
ever do that again!

6
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:24,036
They brought Kageyama
like we asked them to,

7
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:26,505
so we can't just show up
without our official setter...

8
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:28,741
That would make
us look bad.

9
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:29,875
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:31,476
[GIRL A]
Careful, Oikawa!

11
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:33,045
Please don't hurt yourself!

12
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:35,047
(GIRLS squealing)

13
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:38,283
Hey, it might be because he's
got all the ladies' attention...

14
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:40,218
but I already hate this guy.

15
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:42,354
Yeah that's Seijoh's
team captain.

16
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:43,522
[RYUNOSUKE SHOYO]
(surprised)

17
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:46,191
Oikawa. A super
offensive setter.

18
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,427
[TOBIO] Top of his class
in attacking and team play.
[TORU] Sorry I had to leave you
guys hanging while my leg was

19
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:54,232
[SHOYO, internal]
(surprised) If HE thinks this
guy is good, then... Hmm...

20
00:00:54,332 --> 00:00:56,368
Yeah... and he's got
a bad attitude too.

21
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:58,203
What? Is it worse
than yours?!

22
00:00:58,303 --> 00:00:59,805
[TOBIO]
Even worse than Four‐Eyes.

23
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:01,840
[SHOYO] That IS bad!
(KEI glaring)

24
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,477
Since you know him, I guess
he must've also gone to
Kitagawa First, huh?

25
00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:08,681
Yeah. He was my
upperclassman.

26
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:12,951
[SHOYO, internal]
If he's above the
King, then he's...

27
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,486
...the Great King?!

28
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:18,156
Hey there! Long time
no see, Kageyama!

29
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:56,421
How long has it been since I saw
you? You've really grown!

30
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:58,423
[TORU]
How's it feel to be the King?

31
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,826
He's good... I learned
everything I know

32
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:02,828
about serving and
blocking from him.

33
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:04,797
(SHOYO gasps)
[TOBIO] Do not
underestimate him.

34
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:07,700
[SHOYO, internal]
He must've invented
that killer serve.

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,235
Still... for now we should
stay focused on the game...

36
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:11,570
We are gonna take
that last set!

37
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,838
Y‐yeah!

38
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:14,873
[TOBIO]
Tanaka, stop with the faces!

39
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:17,042
Now get over there and warm up!

40
00:03:17,142 --> 00:03:19,978
And be extra thorough so
you don't get yourself
injured again!

41
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:20,979
Alright.

42
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,115
(GIRLS squealing)

43
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:26,151
[RYUNOSUKE] I'm
gonna kill this guy!
(TOBIO frown)

44
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,422
[GIRL A] Come on, when are
they gonna let Oikawa play?

45
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:32,024
[GIRL B]
No he can't go in yet.

46
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,559
[GIRL B] If he doesn't
warm up first,
[DAICHI] Stay focused!

47
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:34,827
[GIRL B] he might hurt
his beautiful body.

48
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:37,462
[GIRL A]
Oh nooo, that would be awful!

49
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:39,598
[GIRL B] I know, right?
(RYUNOSUKE growling)

50
00:03:39,698 --> 00:03:41,767
[RYUNOSUKE]
Comin' atcha!

51
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,508
[DAICHI, internal]
One more point.

52
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,109
[KOSHI, internal]
That's all we need.

53
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,113
[SHOYO, internal]
We might just win
against a top 4 team!

54
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,716
[YUTARO]
Don't start getting cocky yet!

55
00:03:57,816 --> 00:03:59,117
[MATSUKAWA] Yes!
(whistle)

56
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:00,318
[HAJIME]
Nice, Kindaichi!

57
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:01,687
[DAICHI]
It's alright. Shake it off!

58
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:03,789
(thinking)

59
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,959
[TORU]
Uh‐oh. Looks like
we're in trouble.

60
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:08,226
You warmed up?

61
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:10,395
I'm ready anytime.

62
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:12,831
(whistle)

63
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,267
(GIRLS squealing)
[TORU] Just leave
everything to me, okay?

64
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:16,835
[AKIRA]
Right.

65
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:18,704
[SHOYO, internal]
Ahhh... It's the Great King!

66
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:19,938
[DAICHI] Cut that out!
[RYUNOSUKE] Bleeehhhh!

67
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:22,107
(annoyed)

68
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,910
Wait, are they swapping
our setter out?

69
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,412
He's not the setter.
He was filling in.

70
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:28,947
[HAJIME]
You're up, Oikawa!

71
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:32,651
It doesn't matter how
powerful their attacks are.

72
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:37,823
If they never make a solid
connection with the ball...
then what's the point?

73
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:40,325
Hm?

74
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:41,927
What?

75
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,737
[KEI] Huh?
[KOSHI, internal]
He's targeting Tsukishima!

76
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:53,071
(STUDENTS dodging)
(whistle)

77
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,973
(KOSHI TAKEDA startled)
[TADASHI] Tsukki!

78
00:04:55,073 --> 00:04:56,942
(CROWD cheering)
[SHOYO] (panic)
[DAICHI] (annoyed)

79
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,945
[TORU]
I just started watching,
but looks like I was right.

80
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:03,682
[TORU] Number 6... and Number 5.
[KEI] (surprised)
[SHOYO] Uwah!

81
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:06,852
You two must be first‐years;
your receives are terrible.

82
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:08,486
[KEI] (annoyed)
[SHOYO] (stunned)

83
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:10,923
[KOSHI, internal]
His momentum's even better
than Kageyama's.

84
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:13,859
And he's got the control to land
the ball anywhere he chooses.

85
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,193
This guy's really good.

86
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:18,163
[KOSHI, internal]
So that's Seijoh's captain.

87
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:20,633
Now... one more time.

88
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:25,437
(KEI grunting)
(whistle)

89
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:26,972
Poor Tsukki!

90
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:28,974
(AOBA JOHSAI cheering)
[KEI] Damn.

91
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,610
[DAICHI]
Don't worry about it, guys!

92
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,082
[SHOYO, internal]
Tsukishima's a jerk and he gets
on my nerves... but for some
reason... grrr.....

93
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:40,252
[TORU]
Ah, just one more point to tie.

94
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:42,187
[SHOYO]
Hey, Great King!

95
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:44,356
Why don't you aim for
me?! I can take it!

96
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:46,992
Just aim the ball right at my
head! Unless you're too scared!
[TORU] Great King?

97
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:49,027
Stop it, you're acting
like a toddler!

98
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:50,996
(angry) Excuse
me?! Hmph.

99
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,931
[SHOYO, internal]
This freakin' guy always
knows what to say

100
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:56,134
to make me mad... but still...!

101
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:59,271
[RYUNOSUKE] Listen up! The cool
thing about volleyball is...
[SHOYO] The cool thing about
volleyball is...

102
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:03,341
...everybody you see on this
side of the net is your ally,
okay Tsukishima?!

103
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:06,078
[KEI] (pissed)
[RYUNOSUKE] Wise words from a
wise guy!

104
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:11,750
[DAICHI]
Okay... Let's fall back as a
group... Tsukishima, you stay
close to the sideline.

105
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,051
[KEI] Right.

106
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:15,754
[DAICHI] Now... Let's go!

107
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:19,024
Oooh... The Captain is the
strongest receiver,

108
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:21,527
and now he's expanding
his defense zone.

109
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:23,028
[GUY A]
One more!

110
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:24,630
[TORU]
Still... It takes more than one
player

111
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,264
to defend the whole court!

112
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:27,900
Argh!

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,068
Tsukkiiiii!
How can he pinpoint
someone who's so far away?!

114
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:33,471
But he's emphasizing
control, so the momentum
should be slower!

115
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,908
It's up!

116
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:37,510
You're awesome, Tsukki!

117
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,578
Oh, you got it! Niiiiice!

118
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:41,847
I guess I made it
too easy... Oh well.

119
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:44,683
[TORU]
You guys just gave us
a little gift though.

120
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:46,018
Agh Dammit!

121
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:49,021
Oh my... Look at that
delicious chance ball...

122
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:50,989
Don't mind if we
do, thank you!

123
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,058
[YAHABA] I got it!
[KOSHI, internal] Uh‐oh,

124
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:56,995
this rotation doesn't give us
enough blocking height...

125
00:06:57,095 --> 00:07:01,600
[YAHABA] Kindaichi!
[YUTARO, internal] Alright, I
shook off all the blockers‐
(surprised)

126
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,070
[YUTARO]
Where'd the shorty come from?!

127
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,606
[TOBIO] There it goes! Get it!
[RYUNOSUKE] Nice one‐touch, pal!
[DAICHI] Chance ball!

128
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:11,143
Just wait, carrot‐top, next time
I'm gonna smack you down!

129
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:18,717
[TOBIO, internal]
If you miss Hinata by even the
smallest instant, he'll be
impossible to catch.

130
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:21,286
The only thing that can
keep up with him...

131
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:23,188
[TOBIO]
...is the ball!

132
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:26,525
(TORU stunned)

133
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:44,142
(long whistle)

134
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,546
(STUDENTS surprised,
taken aback)

135
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:49,014
What was that?

136
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:51,349
That guy moved across the
court in a split second.

137
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,186
The ball flew straight into
his hand like a magnet.

138
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:56,454
(amazed)

139
00:07:56,555 --> 00:07:58,090
Aww yeah!

140
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,627
[DAICHI] Line up!
(TAKEDA floored)

141
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:03,962
[KOSHI] (notice) Is there
something wrong?
[PLAYERS] We did it!

142
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:05,531
[TAKEDA]
Incredible...

143
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,932
[KOSHI]
Oh yeah, that's right!

144
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:08,433
I guess this is the first time
you've seen

145
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:10,468
Hinata and Kageyama's special
attack in action...

146
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,406
It's pretty cool, huh?
In fact, it's so cool it kinda
freaks me out! Huh?

147
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:16,408
[RYUNOSUKE TOBIO DAICHI]
We're ready!
[SHOYO] Uh, ready!

148
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:18,911
(TAKEDA startled)
[KOSHI] You're supposed to
give them some feedback.

149
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:21,079
[TAKEDA]
Oh, sorry, I didn't know.

150
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:23,582
Lemme see... Well,
like I said...

151
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:26,752
I don't know that much about
volleyball... but still!

152
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:32,090
[TAKEDA]
I can tell something really
great is starting to take shape.

153
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,326
[RYUNOSUKE DAICHI]
Huh?

154
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:37,963
[TAKEDA]
We've just had some really
gifted first‐years join the
team...

155
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:41,767
and things didn't run so
smoothly at first... but now...

156
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:46,404
I think I understand why!
Even if everyone doesn't
always agree...

157
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:50,909
[TAKEDA]
Whenever people are brought
together.. it creates a chemical
reaction.

158
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:56,715
[TAKEDA]
Somewhere in the world,
there's a fateful encounter
happening at this very moment.

159
00:08:56,815 --> 00:09:01,353
[TAKEDA]
It could be happening somewhere
far away in a completely
different country...

160
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,789
...or on the other
side of the globe.

161
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:09,127
Or maybe... it's on a
small Eastern island...
in a tiny Northern town...

162
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:14,432
in an ordinary high school...
in a regular volleyball club.

163
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:19,204
[TAKEDA]
I believe that encounter was
made at Karasuno.

164
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:23,441
I don't have any proof yet...
But I can't ignore what I
believe!

165
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:29,447
And before too long...
this team is going
become even stronger.

166
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:33,752
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Uh...

167
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:35,020
I'm sorry!

168
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,589
That was too weird,
wasn't it?! I'll stop!

169
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:40,058
No no no, that was
great, Takeda! Thanks!

170
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:41,459
[ALL]
Thank you!

171
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,929
[TAKEDA]
Uh... sure.

172
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,535
[TOBIO]
Kindaichi.

173
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:01,313
[YUTARO]
(serious) We cannot deal with
Kageyama anymore, Coach!

174
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:04,349
I know he's got amazing
attack power and everything...

175
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:07,252
but he's obviously been
holding the whole team back!

176
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:08,521
(sigh)

177
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:09,888
[YUTARO]
Seriously...

178
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:11,990
we're better off without him.

179
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:18,063
Hey uh...

180
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:19,698
Don't even apologize to me!

181
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:20,933
(speechless)

182
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,502
And I'm not going
to either!

183
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:24,937
Okay.

184
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:26,872
To me, you're always gonna
be that self‐centered,

185
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:28,473
pain‐in‐the‐ass
King of the Court,

186
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:32,310
the number‐one person on Earth
I want to defeat one day!

187
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:33,946
Fine.

188
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,114
So don't ruin that!
Fine.

189
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:38,016
There's no need for the two of
us to make up...

190
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:40,152
I mean we were never
friends to start with!

191
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:41,419
Fine.

192
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:45,624
But next time we
meet... I WILL win!

193
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:54,366
[TOBIO] Yeah well... (surprised)
[SHOYO SHOYO] Weehoo! Time to go
wash up, oh yeah!

194
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:58,837
You can call me Shoyo, Future
Ace of Karasunooo‐ (startled)

195
00:10:58,937 --> 00:11:03,509
[SHOYO, internal]
(gasp) Whoa, it's about to go
down! Are they gonna fight?

196
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,044
I should probably stay away
from something like that...

197
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:07,913
[TOBIO]
Kindaichi.

198
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:09,748
The next time you and I meet...

199
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:10,849
We're gonna beat you again.

200
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:12,718
(surprised)

201
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:20,425
[AKIRA]
Hm? Hey, what was
that all about?

202
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:23,395
He just... used
the word "we".

203
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:25,764
[AKIRA] Huh?
[SHOYO] Are you crying?

204
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:28,400
[TOBIO] Of course not, you
little freak! Just go wash
up already!
[YUTARO] Until now, it was

205
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,003
[SHOYO] Aw, you don't have to
hide your feelings, Kageyama.
[YUTARO] like he was
on a team by himself.

206
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:32,738
[TOBIO]
Agh... you IDIOTTTT!

207
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:38,777
[YUTARO] Have...
have I already lost?
[SHOYO] Ow ow ow!

208
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:43,015
Ow! What was that for?!

209
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:49,788
[EVERYONE]
Thank you for playing with us!

210
00:11:51,256 --> 00:11:53,291
[DAICHI]
Takeda's right, but...

211
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:56,261
...if we ever want to play and
win a real game against Seijoh

212
00:11:56,361 --> 00:11:58,430
with Oikawa in the
setter position.

213
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:01,233
We're still missing
a vital ingredient.

214
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,936
[TORU]
Wow.. Very well said captain.

215
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:05,203
(surprised)

216
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:07,773
That's surprisingly astute.

217
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:09,241
(smirk)

218
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:11,409
[SHOYO]
Look out it's the
Great King again!

219
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,478
[RYUNOSUKE] What's your damage?
[SHOYO] Gotta problem?

220
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:16,048
[RYUNOSUKE] Wanna
knuckle sandwich?!
[SHOYO] Yeah, let's rumble!

221
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:19,284
Ah, come now, no need
to get yourselves up.

222
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:21,019
But hey, short stuff.

223
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,623
That one‐touch and broad
jump were great... You
should be proud.

224
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,625
Huh? Oh...

225
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:30,395
Next time, we should try doing
things full‐out from the start.

226
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:31,429
(surprised)

227
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,532
[TORU]
You haven't seen our real setup.

228
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:38,103
But don't worry... we'll
be working on perfecting
our serves 'til then.

229
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:40,839
[SHOYO, internal]
That's true, it'll be
different.

230
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:44,710
Next time we'll be dealing with
his serves the whole game.

231
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,446
[TORU]
That combination attack
is pretty effective,

232
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:50,983
but you're going to run out of
steam at some point.

233
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,619
You need to improve
your receives.

234
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:57,823
[TORU]
After all, I'm not the only
person who does power serves.

235
00:12:57,923 --> 00:13:02,094
[TORU]
The Inter‐High tournaments are
coming up, and I want you to
make the cut.

236
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:04,663
[TORU]
Listen carefully...

237
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:08,266
...my special protege... I want
to crush you fair and square...

238
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:11,036
at an official game,
where we both play the setter!

239
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:13,839
[KEI] (startled)
[SHOYO] Yeah well... We can
train to receive, fancy‐pants!

240
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:15,307
[KEI]
Hey, let me go!

241
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:17,042
Just so you know,
receives aren't

242
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:20,278
something you can
master overnight.

243
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:22,548
[TORU]
I'm sure your Captain
can attest to that.

244
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:28,453
If we happen to meet again at
the tournament... I look forward
to seeing all your improvement.

245
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:31,557
Look.. Do not let
him get to you...

246
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:35,160
Antagonizing people is just
one of those things he likes
to do, so...

247
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,530
(DAICHI chuckling)
(TOBIO confused)

248
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,499
He's right... We don't have a
whole lot of time until then...

249
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,302
but.. luckily we have
someone coming back soon.

250
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:47,372
[RYUNOSUKE] (shock) (grin)
[SHOYO] Hm? Who's coming back?

251
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:50,643
[DAICHI]
Karasuno's... guardian.

252
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:55,213
[SHOYO, internal]
Karasuno's... guardian?

253
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:13,165
[HAJIME]
Kageyama's getting
really good, huh?

254
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:18,571
Yeah. He's a prodigy who's
finally found an outlet for
his very specific set of
abilities...

255
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:21,339
The average player's
no match for him now.

256
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,642
Wait, are you saying you're
not a match for him either?

257
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:26,378
Not for his sets...
When it comes to that,

258
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:28,881
no one in the prefecture
can out do Kageyama.

259
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:33,318
I'm every bit as good as him
at spikes, blocks and serves
though... Ow, what the‐?!

260
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:36,321
You know damn well your
sets are as good as his too!

261
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:38,423
That is why you're
our setter!

262
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:40,392
Sorry... but it's
the truth, okay?

263
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:43,596
Which is why we're going
to sabotage their receiving...

264
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,864
Because no matter how perfectly
they can catch a serve,

265
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:48,734
it's all for naught if
it doesn't make it back
to the setter.

266
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,436
If we get matched with
Karasuno in a real game...

267
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,471
... we'll have to ruin
all of their receives

268
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:55,608
so Kageyama never gets
to make one of those
flawless sets!

269
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,743
They can't just rely on
just one person to win!

270
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:00,513
Ah, I'm already looking
forward to cheering them
up after they lose!

271
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:01,814
(annoyed)

272
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:04,182
What? Didn't you
say you hated him
for being a genius?

273
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:07,219
Not as much as I hate
pretty‐boys like you
who get all the girls!

274
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:10,556
[TORU]
Ow! Prejudice like that isn't
very becoming on you, my friend!
Ow! OWW! Stop it!

275
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:14,893
[HANAMAKI]
(sigh) Hey, cut that out or the
Coach's gonna us one of his
lectures again!

276
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:17,663
[DAICHI]
Good job, guys!

277
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:20,198
Now let's do a little light
cleaning and call it a day!

278
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:21,767
[ALL] Yes sir!
[SHOYO] (snoring)

279
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,168
[TOBIO]
Watch it!

280
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:25,037
Thanks a bunch for setting
everything up, Takeda.

281
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:28,173
Don't mention it; you guys
did a great job! I still
can't believe we won

282
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:30,843
against a prestigious team like
Aoba Johsai!
[KOSHI] Come on, let's
mop up and go home.

283
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:33,779
[DAICHI] Yeah, but the
fight is just beginning.
[ALL] Right!

284
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,213
[TAKEDA]
Huh?

285
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:37,415
I mean... thanks to that
combo technique of ours...

286
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:39,852
we can put up a
pretty good offense.

287
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:42,320
[DAICHI] But if Hinata gets
caught by blockers and
[CHIKARA] Uh‐it's okay
if you're too tired to mop!

288
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,690
[DAICHI] our receivers aren't up
to par like today,
[CHIKARA] You can go home!

289
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,092
[DAICHI] we won't have
a strong enough defense.
[TADASHI] Aw, look, Tsukki!
[KEI] Tragic.

290
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:50,829
And besides... we uh don't
really have a coach... So uh...

291
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:54,266
when it comes to that kind
of advice... you're not all
that much help.

292
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,534
You have a point.

293
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:57,302
Oh! That came out wrong!

294
00:15:57,402 --> 00:15:59,404
I promise I wasn't saying
you're not doing a good job!

295
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:01,740
[TAKEDA] (laugh)
I didn't take it that way...

296
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,977
Leave the coach problem to me.
I have someone in mind.

297
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:07,112
Huh? Do you really?
Who is it?

298
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:11,784
[TAKEDA]
Well, it's someone I've tried
and failed to win over several
times now...

299
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:15,521
...but I'm sure I'll
think of something.

300
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,656
Do you mind locking up when
you guys are done today?

301
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:20,258
Yeah, sure.

302
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,661
Whoa, I think Take's
starting to take charge.

303
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:23,962
Mm‐hm...

304
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:27,766
Hm? It's broken...

305
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:30,135
Hey, can I throw away this mop?
Someone might get a splinter.

306
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:33,506
[KOSHI]
Huh? (surprised) No,
it's fine! Just leave it!

307
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:37,075
I'm sure that it can
be fixed somehow.

308
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:38,844
Huh?

309
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,016
[CHIKARA]
Good night!

310
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:46,084
[KAZUHITO HISASHI]
Night!

311
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:47,620
[KEISHIN]
Meat buns?

312
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,889
Sorry boys, the soccer geeks
just bought up all I had...

313
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,991
I know life is so unfair.

314
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:54,226
I'm hungry!

315
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:56,028
Yeah, where's
your manager?!

316
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:59,331
I AM the manager!
Now get your butts home
and eat some real food!

317
00:16:59,431 --> 00:17:01,099
Build up a little muscle!

318
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,968
[ALL]
(startled)(dejected)

319
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:04,302
[KEISHIN]
Here.

320
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,739
(catch)
(smacked)
(chomp)

321
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,306
[SHOYO]
Wow!

322
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,608
[ALL]
Thanks!

323
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,209
Now go eat your dinners.

324
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:12,811
[SHOYO RYUNOSUKE]
Woohoo!

325
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:14,947
(phone ringing)

326
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,849
Ugh...

327
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:19,417
[KEISHIN]
Sakanoshita.

328
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:24,623
(exhale) Not givin' up, eh?

329
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,726
[RYUNOSUKE]
That was nuts.

330
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:29,995
I can't believe how good
that guy's serves were...

331
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:32,765
It's a good thing he didn't
show up until the final set.

332
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,934
Makes sense that he came from
Kageyama's middle school.

333
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:37,970
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh? Hang on.

334
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,640
[RYUNOSUKE] Why'd you pick our
school anyway, Kageyama?
[TOBIO] (eating)
[SHOYO] Hm?

335
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,944
Shiratorizawa's got the best
team in the whole prefecture;
why didn't you just go there?

336
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:47,580
[SHOYO]
Shira‐Huh?

337
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,715
How have you never heard of
Shiratorizawa?

338
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:51,650
Those guys have got
unbelievable skills;

339
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,152
they rank in the top 8 in
the whole country every year!

340
00:17:54,252 --> 00:17:56,221
Whoaa!

341
00:17:56,321 --> 00:17:57,923
Oh yeah, I didn't make
it in there.

342
00:17:58,023 --> 00:17:59,057
No way!

343
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:00,926
Well I didn't get a
recommendation from them,

344
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:03,228
so I had to take the entrance
exam and ended up failing it...

345
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:05,197
Their test is some
pure nonsense.

346
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:07,132
Passing their exam
is extremely hard...

347
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:08,834
I'd say almost impossible.

348
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:12,370
[KEI]
Aww... or maybe the King doesn't
have a head for academics.

349
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,572
[TADASHI] (snicker) Goodnight!
[TOBIO] Tch!

350
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:15,207
Why DID you pick Karasuno?

351
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:18,110
Let me guess, you want
to be like the Tiny Giant
too don't'cha!

352
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,414
No, I picked this school because
I heard that Coach Ukai might
come out of retirement.

353
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:23,616
[SHOYO]
Ukai?

354
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:25,751
He's the best coach
we've ever had!

355
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:28,821
He made a name for Karasuno by
getting us to Spring Nationals!

356
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,222
[SHOYO]
Really?!

357
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:31,690
[RYUNOSUKE]
Yeah dude,

358
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,592
some people even call him
the "Crazy Crow Coach"...

359
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:36,128
you know, since our school
name kinda means "crow".

360
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:39,798
Yeah, the second‐ and third‐
years got a little bit of
instruction from him last
year...

361
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:41,499
but it was pretty
basic and Spartan.

362
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,468
(thrilled)

363
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,370
[KOSHI]
Why are you jealous of that?

364
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,041
[KOSHI]
At one point they were
planning on formally
reinstating him, but...

365
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,543
He collapsed?!

366
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:52,144
Sorry, but the school's
not planning on

367
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:53,912
bringing him back anytime soon.

368
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:56,515
I don't care... No matter
what school I go to...

369
00:18:56,615 --> 00:19:00,819
I'm still going up against
high school students...
And I'm still gonna win.

370
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,189
Look at this guy acting all
cool, not foolin' anyone, buddy.

371
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:06,659
[SHOYO] Pffff!
(extended flailing)
[TOBIO] Don't be stupid!

372
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,362
I'm not trying to act cool at
all! We did beat one of the top
4 schools today, didn't we?!

373
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:13,766
[RYUNOSUKE]
That's true... Two to one
against Aoba Johsai High..

374
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:17,035
And thanks to my boy Hinata
here... I got to score one
unmarked!

375
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,571
Sure thing my man!

376
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:21,139
[RYUNOSUKE]
So, you've made your debut now.

377
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,541
How did it feel?

378
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:24,076
(thinking)

379
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:40,593
On the other hand, you were
losin' your shit for the
whole first set, remember?

380
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:44,797
Yeah, and you lost just as many
points as you scored, so don't
go getting too cocky okay.

381
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:46,899
[KOSHI]
Come on why do you guys
have to bait him like that?!

382
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:48,834
[DAICHI] He's got
a point though.
[KOSHI] Huh?

383
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:51,403
Our team's still lacking.
And in a lot of ways...

384
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,471
We might've won,
but only just barely.

385
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:55,541
Okay, I'll practice
myself crazy!

386
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:58,376
Whoa, whoa! Self‐improvement
IS really important.

387
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:02,915
[DAICHI]
But... The main issue here is
that Karasuno still needs a few
more players.

388
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:05,551
[SHOYO] Huh?
[TOBIO] Yeah, I would agree.

389
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:08,521
We need a natural libero...
And also...

390
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:12,625
it would be really handy
to have an ace spiker who can
handle a triple block too.

391
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:14,226
Hey! I can be the ace spiker!

392
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:17,029
You can't! You're supposed
to be the decoy, remember?!

393
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:18,997
(deflated)

394
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,768
But you said our guardian
would come back soon, right?

395
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:26,905
[DAICHI] Yeah.
[KOSHI] Karasuno may not be the
strongest team, but we're not
the weakest either.

396
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:29,441
[KOSHI]
Look, we used to have really
skilled players..

397
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:32,545
but we failed to make sure they
trained their replacements.

398
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,379
[DAICHI RYUNOSUKE]
(troubled)

399
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:36,749
Well now we've
got players again...

400
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:39,885
plus we've recruited
a few first‐year guys.

401
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:43,155
[KOSHI]
We just need to coordinate
all our strengths.

402
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,257
Summer Inter‐High tourney.

403
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:48,661
[DAICHI]
The nationals aren't some
unreachable goal...

404
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:52,464
If we work hard and play our
cards right, I'm positive we
can get there!

405
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:55,701
Right, the Summer Inter‐High
tourney, I know about that! Uh?

406
00:20:55,801 --> 00:21:00,205
So... the libero you said
should be coming back soon,
where has he been all this time?

407
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:04,710
Uhh... Yeah.. he's been serving
a week of suspension,

408
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,145
plus he got banned from all
club activities for a month.

409
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,915
[TOBIO] Hm?
[SHOYO] Huh? So is he some
kind of troublemaker?!

410
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:15,921
[RYUNOSUKE]
Dude, no... He just gets carried
away sometimes. He's a stand‐up
guy though. Trust me on that.

411
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:20,626
[TOBIO, internal] If Tanaka
thinks he gets carried away,
that's saying something.
[RYUNOSUKE] And check this out.

412
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:24,763
[RYUNOSUKE] He's known as
the resident genius of the
volleyball club.
[SHOYO TOBIO] (surprised)

413
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:27,365
But I guess now that we have
smart‐ass Kageyama on the team,

414
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:29,602
he won't get to keep that
nickname anymore, will he?

415
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,436
[TOBIO] (annoyed)
[SHOYO] (chuckle)

416
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:35,240
Do us a favor once he's back...
Call him your "upperclassman".

417
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,043
He gets a stupid kick out
of it like Tanaka does.

418
00:21:38,143 --> 00:21:40,045
(surprised) Hey,
it's not stupid!

419
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:42,280
[SHOYO] (smile)

420
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,017
[SHOYO, internal] I can't wait
to see what our team's guardian
is like.

421
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:48,854
[RYUNOSUKE] Get a move on!
[SHOYO] Ah! Alright I'm coming!

422
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:05,403
(internal) I'm gonna hit it!

423
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:08,073
(grunt)

424
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:08,574
(grunt)

425
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:10,475
Agh! Gwah!

426
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:13,679
Can't you stay out of
my way for five minutes?!

427
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,681
I could've had that
if not for you!

428
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:17,182
[SHOYO]
Yeah well I got it!

429
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:19,652
[TOBIO]
You didn't get anything!
It's out of bounds!

430
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:20,653
[SHOYO]
Whatever.

431
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:22,287
[TOBIO]
Jeez.

432
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,994
(internal) This time for sure!

433
00:22:29,562 --> 00:22:30,896
Huh?

434
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,965
(surprised)

435
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:36,935
(gasp)

436
00:22:39,137 --> 00:22:44,442
(internal) He redirected
its momentum and rotation,
sending it straight to the
setter position.

437
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:46,845
A perfect receive.

438
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,817
[SHOYO]
(shock) Are you
shorter than me?!

439
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,746
[SHOYO]
Who the heck is that?! He just
swooped in out of nowhere!

440
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,915
[TOBIO]
That receive was so
smooth and flawless!

441
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,383
[SHOYO]
I think I'm gonna cry!

442
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:33,485
[DAICHI]
Well, I guess I should
introduce you guys.

443
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:37,823
[DAICHI]
Next Haikyu!!
"The One They Call The Ace."

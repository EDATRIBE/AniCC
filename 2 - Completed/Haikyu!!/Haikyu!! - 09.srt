1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:04,481
[SHOYO]
Come on! Gimme another one!

2
00:00:04,582 --> 00:00:07,384
[TOBIO]
Alright, shut up,
I get it! Ready?

3
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:08,619
[SHOYO]
Yeah!

4
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:13,190
Ah!

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,793
[SHOYO]
GAH! That felt so good!

6
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:19,029
[SHOYO]
And once I reach the top of my
jump, the ball hits my hand...

7
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:25,002
And when the weight of it...
sorta leaves a sting in my
palm... I love that!

8
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:31,341
[SHOYO]
Sweet! Those cats won't
stand a chance against
our quick‐attacks!

9
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:36,213
[ASAHI]
Huh? (internal) Cats? Are
they playing against Nekoma?

10
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:40,217
[DAICHI] We've got ourselves a
practice game... It's the last
day of camp.
[ASAHI] (startled) Aahh!

11
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:43,120
Hey what's your problem?!
Don't run away from me!

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,488
I'm getting out of here.
You scare me when you get mad!

13
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:48,358
Well it's not like
I'm mad all the time!

14
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:52,329
We weren't expecting this...
We know nothing about them...

15
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,698
And the rivalry feels
like an old folktale...

16
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:59,269
I mean it was the generation
before us... So it was never
really relevant to us.

17
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:04,074
But now... ... it's time to
face off, crows versus cats!

18
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:09,179
It's so strange to think that
we're about to have our first
rematch with Nekoma in years...

19
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:12,115
I gotta say I'm pretty
psyched about it.

20
00:01:13,483 --> 00:01:14,852
It's just Suga ...

21
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:16,787
and well of course
Nishinoya, too...

22
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:18,488
I can't face them.

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,391
You know what, Asahi...

24
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:24,995
You really are pretty timid,
especially for such a big guy!

25
00:01:25,095 --> 00:01:27,364
And Nishinoya's the
opposite of that.

26
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:30,534
[ASAHI]
And you could stand to
be a lot less blunt...

27
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:34,938
Anyway, it'll be fine...
Nobody else on the team
has a problem with it...

28
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,374
Unlike you, they're
pretty open‐minded.

29
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:41,244
Uh, Daichi? I thought I
remembered you being nicer.

30
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:44,582
I'll be nicer when you
stop being such a wuss.

31
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:46,249
[ASAHI] (offended)

32
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:48,251
[DAICHI]
I don't care so much
about you skipping out

33
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:53,090
of club activities for a month
and then feeling awkward
about finally coming back.

34
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:56,894
[DAICHI]
Because if you still
love volleyball...

35
00:01:56,994 --> 00:01:59,663
...that's reason enough to play.

36
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:01,064
[ASAHI] (surprised)

37
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,966
[DAICHI]
Not just that...

38
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,868
[DAICHI]
... but we've got this new kid

39
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:07,404
whose dream is to be the ace.

40
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:10,107
(ASAHI thinking)

41
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:14,578
[DAICHI] (punch)
[ASAHI] Ah... Hey!

42
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:53,977
[KEISHIN, singing]
On the banks of the Hirose
ri‐i‐ver...

43
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:59,282
Memories afloat...
on the stream...

44
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:04,454
Dancing lights... over the
rapids‐

45
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:05,455
(freak out)

46
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,157
Hey! What're you
doing here?! (annoyed)

47
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:08,491
[TAKEDA]
Uh I'm sorry!

48
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:10,460
I was just seeing if
you had any customers...

49
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:11,461
(whimper)

50
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:13,096
Are you Here to ask
me to coach again?

51
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:14,732
[TAKEDA]
Yes.

52
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,536
[KEISHIN]
It's not that I don't
still love to play.

53
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:21,138
I even put together
a neighborhood team.

54
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,542
I can't be a coach
'cause I'd drive myself
crazy wanting to play.

55
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:28,111
[TAKEDA] Oh...
[KEISHIN] And besides... I can't
go anywhere near that gym.

56
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,248
(surprised) Uh.. did
something tragic happen there?

57
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:34,752
Not in the least! All my
best memories are there.

58
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:36,620
[TAKEDA]
Then why can't you?

59
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:42,492
[KEISHIN]
I don't care if it's
totally different or
exactly the way I left it.

60
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:46,229
I can't go into that gym or
the club room ever again.

61
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:49,432
[KEISHIN]
The short time I spent
there was so unique...

62
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:53,370
If I went back, it'd feel like
opening a time capsule.

63
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,807
Oh, so it's a nostalgia
thing... 'Kay I get it‐

64
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:58,876
Shut up!

65
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:02,680
And anyway... It's still a 'no.'

66
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,982
[TAKEDA] Even if Nekoma
High's on the schedule?
[KEISHIN] (shocked)

67
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:09,086
[TAKEDA]
The last day of Golden Week.
It's our first time facing them
in five years.

68
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:11,989
Ah... You have got
to be kidding me.

69
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:16,393
Coach Nekomata... the man that
your grandfather used to be
such good friends with...

70
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:22,165
He just came out of retirement.
Once I heard that... I asked
them for a practice game.

71
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:23,501
(KEISHIN speechless)

72
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,135
Back when you were still
in high school...

73
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:28,205
that was when Karasuno had the
strongest ties with them, right?

74
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:30,007
[KEISHIN]
Yeah.

75
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:32,710
And by the way...
Their current coach...

76
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,847
He is the same guy who
played the setter position
about 7 or 8 years ago.

77
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:38,115
(surprised)

78
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:40,918
[NAOI]
This is our last shot, Ukai.

79
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:44,487
[NAOI]
I want to see you at Nationals
this year, alright?

80
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:47,658
[KEISHIN]
Sure! I'll be there!

81
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:51,061
[TAKEDA]
That was back when you
were active in the club...

82
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:55,298
So I was thinking... that maybe
you two might know each other.

83
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,100
[KEISHIN] Hey...
[TAKEDA] Hm?

84
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,836
[KEISHIN]
Are you trying to mess with me?!

85
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:00,838
[TAKEDA, freaking out]
I'm sorry! I'm really
sorry! (manhandled)

86
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:03,206
[KEISHIN]
This is bullshit! You
just came here to push
my buttons!

87
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:06,343
Did you really think that
would work?! What time is
practice today?

88
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:10,080
I said I‐ Huh?
You mean you...?

89
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,484
[KEISHIN]
I'm not letting those
pathetic underclassmen embarrass
our school in front of Nekoma.

90
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,854
Stay right here,
I'll go get changed.

91
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:18,121
Okay! Great!

92
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:20,591
[KEISHIN]
Hey Ma, can you watch the store?

93
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,460
[TAKEDA, happy]
Yes!

94
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:25,863
[KEISHIN]
Hey, uh, Tatsu? It's me.

95
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:27,598
[TAKEDA]
(surprised) Huh?

96
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:36,740
Hey.. Noya?

97
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,108
Yeah?

98
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,878
What kinda training did you
do while you were suspended?

99
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:43,681
Hm... I focused on
blocked ball retrieval.

100
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:47,217
[YU]
So the ball doesn't hit the
floor after they block!

101
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:49,486
I haven't gotten it
down perfect yet...

102
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:51,655
but if I manage to get
really good at it...

103
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:54,825
then you spikers won't
have to worry... And
you can just spike.

104
00:06:54,925 --> 00:07:01,632
[RYUNOSUKE, internal]
Man... every time I see this
guy, he's got more bruises.

105
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,334
Noya! How are you such a
badass all the time?! (sobbing)

106
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:06,504
(huh?) It's nothing
to cry about!

107
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:08,706
(door opening)
[TAKEDA] Um excuse me!

108
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:10,173
[DAICHI]
Alright come over here, guys!

109
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:11,174
(surprised)

110
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:12,676
This is Ukai...

111
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:15,946
As of today, he'll be your
coach! Say hello everyone!

112
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,981
[ALL]
Huh?

113
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,251
(thinking)

114
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:24,555
Whoa, are you serious?!
We have a new coach?!

115
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,590
Just until after
the Nekoma game.

116
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,526
[DAICHI] Huh?
[RYUNOSUKE] Hey wait...

117
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:31,128
Isn't that the grumpy guy who
runs the Sakanoshita store?

118
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:32,429
HE'S coaching us?

119
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,532
He's actually used
to go to this school.

120
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:36,399
He's the old Coach
Ukai's grandson.

121
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:37,735
[ALL]
HUH?!

122
00:07:37,835 --> 00:07:39,770
But your store's called
Saka‐noshita, right?

123
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,372
You shoulda called it Ukai,
dude! I mean, sir!

124
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:44,508
It's named for my mom's
side of the family.

125
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:47,210
[KEISHIN]
Anyway, let's not
waste any more time!

126
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,914
I set you up a game for 6:30..
So c'mon let's see what you got.

127
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:52,650
[SHOYO] Huh?!
[KEISHIN] They're
gonna be here soon.

128
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,518
[DAICHI]
Who will?

129
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:57,821
Our friendly Neighborhood
Association team.

130
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:09,700
[DAICHI]
Because if you still love
volleyball, that's reason
enough to play.

131
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:16,173
(phone ringing)
[CHIKARA] Going in!

132
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:18,408
[TOBIO]
Okay! Hup!

133
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,410
[SHOYO] Coming your way!

134
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:22,412
[KEISHIN] Damn..
He won't pick up.
[HISASHI] Go!

135
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:26,116
[KEISHIN]
I guess it was too short notice
to get 'em all together on a
weekday.

136
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:28,051
[CHIKARA]
Heads up!

137
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:34,424
[SHIMADA]
Here.

138
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:36,827
Um... Thanks I
appreciate it.

139
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:38,662
[TAKINOUE]
What's up!

140
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:39,462
Hey.

141
00:08:39,563 --> 00:08:40,430
[UCHIZAWA]
Oh, man!

142
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:41,865
[MORI]
Takes me back!

143
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,434
Uh, hi?

144
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:47,170
We're the Neighborhood
Club Team.

145
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:50,741
Let's do this!

146
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:53,310
[KEISHIN]
Hey! Thanks for comin' out
at the last minute!

147
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,345
[KEI] The Neighborhood
Association huh...
[TAKINOUE] That's cool,
you can owe us one.

148
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,147
[KEI] I was picturing a bunch
of old guys.
[KEISHIN] Eh, whatever!

149
00:08:57,247 --> 00:09:00,417
[TADASHI] Me too.
[TAKINOUE] Ha, you
think I'm joking!

150
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:02,920
[KEISHIN]
Alright! You boys ready to play
or what?

151
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,855
[ALL] Yeah!
[SHOYO] Yeah! Here we go!

152
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:08,826
[KEISHIN] Hm? What's
with you? You sick?
[YU] Hm? (look)

153
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:11,762
[DAICHI]
Oh... sorry... He's
not ready to play yet.

154
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:14,464
Why not? Is he injured or
something? What's wrong?

155
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:16,934
No, it's not really as
straightforward as all that.

156
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:20,538
So he's not gonna
participate then?
Well whatever it is..

157
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:25,475
you can play with us if
you want... Our libero's
been pretty tied up with
a buncha work stuff.

158
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:27,210
Do... you want to?

159
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,513
(frown)

160
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:34,818
[KEISHIN]
Hm, we're still short a couple
guys. You have more members,
don't you?

161
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:36,787
[SHOYO] There's Asahi! Look!
(YU shocked)

162
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:37,655
(gasp)

163
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,523
[SHOYO]
Asahi! Hey!

164
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:41,224
Agh! It's that
short guy again!

165
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:43,193
[ASHAI] Listen, I was
just here to uhhh...
[RYUNOSUKE] Asahi?!

166
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,529
You gotta be kidding! Late
on the coach's first day?!

167
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:46,830
What position do you play?!

168
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,666
[ASAHI, startled]
Uh‐wing spiker?

169
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:50,500
Whatever, I don't care,
we need some more players!

170
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:52,069
Get your ass in
here and warm up!

171
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:55,105
(ASAHI stunned)
[KEISHIN] Chop chop, man‐bun!

172
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,379
(RYUNOSUKE SHOYO excited)

173
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,181
(watching)

174
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:23,734
So we just need a setter...
I would do it myself, but I
really should watch the game.

175
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:27,237
[KEISHIN]
Hey, do me a favor and let me
borrow one of your setters,
would ya?

176
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,072
(BOTH surprised)

177
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:32,810
(surprised) Sugawara!

178
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,146
Listen you're not doing
this for me, are you?

179
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:42,219
Because if the only way I can
rise up the ranks is at your
expense... I'm not doing it.

180
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:46,489
[KOSHI]
You know what... whenever
you joined the club...

181
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:52,095
I knew that I had to fight you
for the setter spot... but it
was kinda... it was a relief.

182
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:55,699
[KOSHI]
The setter is the attack
axis for the whole team.

183
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,269
A setter has to be composed
and steadfast... But I...

184
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:02,840
I was too nervous to put
the ball in the right spot.

185
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,475
[KOSHI]
After what happened to Asahi,

186
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:09,713
I was so afraid that my
tosses would cause another
spiker to get blocked...

187
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:13,283
So I was content to just
hide in Kageyama's shadow.

188
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:18,055
It was... easier.

189
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:21,992
[KOSHI]
Just the thought of a spike
getting shut down like that
terrifies me.

190
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:28,999
[KOSHI]
But... Please let me... set
for you one more time... okay?

191
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:30,734
(surprised)

192
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:35,172
[KOSHI] I'm playing on their
side... Oh and...
[TOBIO] Hm?

193
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:38,609
I am not losing.

194
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,611
And me neither.

195
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:43,480
Now give me some of your
famous receives, okay? (grin)

196
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:45,282
Oh you know it.

197
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:50,554
[DAICHI] Okay, time
to start the game!
[SHOYO] Asahi decided
to come... See?

198
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:53,156
Yeah well... is
he gonna stay?

199
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:54,157
(whistle)

200
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:55,959
[ALL]
Thank you!

201
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:59,229
Looks pretty threatening
standing over here.

202
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:02,900
[TAKINOUE]
Alright, kids...
Don't poop your pants

203
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:08,171
[SHOYO, internal]
Let's see the Ace in action!

204
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,992
[SHIMADA]
Nice receive!

205
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:35,365
(whistle)
[TAKINOUE] Hey, that was a
great set there, buddy!
Really nice job!

206
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:37,300
(happy) Wow!
Thank you so much!

207
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,302
Sugawara's
killing it! Uh?

208
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:43,106
Well of course he is! Suga's
our official setter, after all!

209
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:45,275
[RYUNOSUKE]
He's so happy...
(TOBIO annoyed)

210
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,778
Hey, nice going, Suga!

211
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:50,180
[KOSHI]
Thanks... but I didn't do
anything special;

212
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,150
it's only because they're
adjusting their whole dynamic
to suit my play style...

213
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,252
These people are real
vets of the game.

214
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:58,455
[TAKINOUE] Yeah!
[KOSHI] My setting still
needs quite a bit of work.

215
00:12:58,556 --> 00:12:59,990
(listening)

216
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,993
[KOSHI]
Still... We have to start
playing hardball...

217
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:05,395
and get a good handle on those
fast attacks too...

218
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:09,199
If we don't, the game'll ride on
just one player like last time.

219
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:13,504
You know... you're
actually kinda cool.

220
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:17,741
What? Really? Wow, coming
from you, that's kind of
a huge compliment.

221
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:19,643
[YU]
Huh? Why's that?

222
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,479
[KOSHI]
Well uh... (laugh)

223
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,517
[ASAHI, internal]
Suga, you've become much more of
a leader than I remember.

224
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:29,587
[ASAHI, internal] And Nishinoya
is as constant as ever.
[YU] I'm serious; you've really
upped your cool factor.

225
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:36,627
[ASAHI, internal]
And here I am, coming out of
nowhere and just drifting back
onto the team...

226
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:41,031
I'm so pathetic...
But even so...

227
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,934
[MORI]
You can do it!

228
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:46,537
[UCHIZAWA]
One more!

229
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:51,441
[ASAHI, internal]
I really... I really
do love being here.

230
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:56,614
[TAKINOUE]
(stunned) Whoa! That was nuts!

231
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:58,616
[SHOYO] Haha! We did it!
[TOBIO] Yeah!

232
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:00,684
[UCHIZAWA]
He really got some air!

233
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:02,986
[SHIMADA]
And that set was scary accurate.

234
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:05,956
(TAKEDA quiet rejoicing)
(KEISHIN floored)

235
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:08,491
[DAICHI]
That was excellent, you two!

236
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:12,696
[SHOYO]
Thanks to Kageyama's amazing
sets I can get past anybody now!

237
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:18,902
[SHOYO]
The wall just fades away, and
then the view of the other side
is totally clear!

238
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,807
[ASAHI]
The view of the other side...

239
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:28,445
[ASAHI]
(gasp) (spike)

240
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:29,479
(whistle)

241
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,814
(CROWD cheers)

242
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:31,915
[DAICHI]
We're good!

243
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,817
[KOSHI]
One more try!

244
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:38,922
[KOSHI]
That's a bluff!

245
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:41,358
[RYUNOSUKE] Good job, Noya! Hah!
[KOSHI] Asahi!

246
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:46,730
(CROWD cheers)

247
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,498
(angry)

248
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:51,134
[GUY A]
Well they did flub that one...
but their libero's a superstar.

249
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:54,404
[YU] My bad! I'll
get it next time!
[GUY B] Yeah, he definitely
knows what he's doing.

250
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:56,640
[GUY A]
Too bad their
attacker's no good.

251
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,579
[ASAHI, panting]
Blocked again... How many times
has that happened to me now?

252
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:07,751
[ASAHI, internal]
I've asked for so many
chances. I promised I would
make them count.

253
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:10,621
[ASAHI, internal] But then I
was paralyzed by my fear...
[DAICHI] I'm open!

254
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:13,423
[ASAHI, internal]
...and I didn't want to
call for them anymore.

255
00:15:13,524 --> 00:15:15,158
What's going on?

256
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:15,959
Asahi?

257
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:17,595
[DAICHI]
Suga, aim right!

258
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:18,529
[KOSHI]
D‐Daichi!

259
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:21,164
Uwwwaaah!

260
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:22,432
(whistle)
(DAICHI frustrated)

261
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:24,868
(long whistle)
(CROWD cheers)

262
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:29,406
[YU]
Dammit!

263
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:35,445
I was worthless out there...
I couldn't save a single
blocked ball!

264
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:36,847
(ASAHI choked up)

265
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:39,950
[ASAHI]
Nishi! Why won't you
blame ME for this?!

266
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,385
I am the one who cost us
the game!

267
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:46,189
Even if you could have saved
one, it'd be pointless because
I couldn't make it count‐

268
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:47,357
[DAICHI] Asahi!

269
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:53,330
[YU] What exactly do you
mean by pointless?
[ASAHI] (breath)

270
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,900
And while we're at it,
why didn't you call for
the ball at the end?

271
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,302
Come on you were in
the perfect position.

272
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:01,839
(ASAHI speechless)
[KOSHI] Hey! Just lay
off him, Nishinoya!

273
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,441
It was my fault for sending
him too many sets in a row
before that‐

274
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:07,645
[ASAHI]
Even if you did Suga... it
wouldn't have mattered anyway.

275
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:11,982
[YU]
(angry) You never know until
you hit the damn thing! You
know that!

276
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:14,918
[YU]
The next spike might be
the one to break through!

277
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:17,287
[KOSHI]
(concerned) Hey! (startled)

278
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:22,292
Don't you ever give up on a
ball... not while I'm keeping
it in for you!

279
00:16:22,392 --> 00:16:24,628
[RYUNOSUKE]
Noya! Take it easy!

280
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:26,429
[YU] (grabbed)
I am the libero!

281
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,499
[YU] I am the last defense!
The team needs me!
[RYUNOSUKE] (struggling)

282
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,471
But... I can't score us points.
(shaky sigh)

283
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:38,509
[YU]
And I can't even attack
either... So...

284
00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:43,246
I don't care how many spikes
get blocked... I'd never blame
you for that.

285
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:47,785
But quit... and I'll never
be able to forgive you!

286
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:50,387
(ASAHI choked up)

287
00:16:54,324 --> 00:16:57,595
[RYUNOSUKE] A‐Asahi!
[KOSHI] Asahi! Wait, don't go!

288
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:06,336
[ASAHI]
Ah...

289
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:10,240
Tell me... Why weren't
you there yesterday?

290
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:12,375
Did you forget
or something?

291
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:14,545
The Inter‐High
tournament coming up.

292
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:18,415
Yeah where's the fun in hitting
spikes that don't mean anything?

293
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:22,285
[ASAHI, internal]
What am I saying?
That's not how I feel.

294
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:26,824
You must be sick of
retrieving balls for no
reason... aren't you?

295
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:30,661
[ASAHI, internal]
Stop it. Nishinoya doesn't think
that way either!

296
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:33,764
[ASAHI]
I know Suga feels guilty
every time I get blocked‐

297
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:37,267
[YU]
Oh who gives a damn what anybody
else thinks about it?!

298
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:43,240
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
What on earth is all the racket
about out here?! Stop shouting
in the halls!

299
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,074
Asahi!

300
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:45,075
Young man‐

301
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:46,343
[YU]
Don't touch me!

302
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:47,845
(vase crashing)
(GIRLS gasp, concerned)

303
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:49,913
(VICE PRINCIPAL gasping
and freaking out)

304
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:52,583
[GUY C]
Uh‐oh, someone's in trouble.

305
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:56,419
(VICE PRINCIPAL exasperated)

306
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:01,725
[YU]
Don't you want to make
a spike that matters?!

307
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:05,128
[RYUNOSUKE] Nice one, Hinata!

308
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:06,396
(ASAHI surprised)
[SHOYO] Thank you!

309
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:09,132
Hinata.. It's
your serve.

310
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,602
[ASAHI] I was wrong.
[YU] Huh?

311
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:14,638
[ASAHI]
I know I got stopped
by the wall...

312
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:18,676
but I want to... I want to
keep trying to break through it.

313
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:26,416
[YU] And that's all
that matters.
[ASAHI] Hm?

314
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:29,419
That was all I needed
to hear from you, Asahi.

315
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,555
(ASAHI speechless)

316
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:35,593
(YU preparing breath)

317
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:42,232
[YU, internal]
My job... is just to
keep the ball in play.

318
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,802
[CHIKARA]
Do your best, Hinata!

319
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:45,669
[TAKINOUE]
It's in!

320
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:46,870
[SHIMADA]
Agh!

321
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,806
My bad! Cover me!

322
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:50,874
[UCHIZAWA]
Hey, bun‐head! Finish it off!

323
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:51,709
(nervous)

324
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:53,176
(surprised)

325
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:56,079
[YU, internal]
The sky belongs to the spikers.

326
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:59,382
I can't compete in their space.

327
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:02,553
[RYUNOSUKE] (panicked breath)
[TOBIO] Shut him down!
[KEI] Yeah I don't take
orders from you.

328
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:04,588
[RYUNOSUKE]
Come on, man, we're
playin' for keeps!

329
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,224
[YU, internal]
...but if I can just keep
the ball up in the air...

330
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:11,595
[ASAHI]
I know I got stopped by the
wall... But I want to keep
trying to break through it.

331
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:14,598
[YU, internal]
I know I can trust
the ace to nail it.

332
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:20,003
[TOBIO] Damn!

333
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:21,471
(focus)

334
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:30,581
[SHIMADA]
Whoa! It's up!

335
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:33,116
[UCHIZAWA] Nice follow‐thru!
[RYUNOSUKE] (shocked)

336
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:37,621
[YU]
I focused on blocked ball
retrieval, so the ball doesn't
hit the floor after they block!

337
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:41,124
[RYUNOSUKE]
Great job, Noya! (sob)
[KEI] Huh?

338
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:45,128
[YU]
Even if the ball
rebounds off the wall...

339
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:47,698
I WILL keep it in
play! So please...

340
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:52,803
You have to ask the setter
for another chance, Asahi!
You're the ace!

341
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:54,337
(shocked)

342
00:19:54,437 --> 00:19:56,273
[SHIMADA] Cover me!
[KOSHI] Right here!

343
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:59,543
[KOSHI, internal]
Woah! Who do I send the ball to?

344
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:02,646
The left is open, so it's
probably our best bet, but...

345
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:06,416
...what if I cause Asahi
to get blocked again?

346
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:08,185
[TOBIO] Sugawara!
(KOSHI surprised)

347
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:11,121
Keep throwing it to him...
until he scores!

348
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:13,490
Oh that's just cruel,
Your Majesty.

349
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:14,592
[TOBIO]
Quiet!

350
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:16,594
[KOSHI, internal]
When the chips are down

351
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:18,696
and the receives are
all over the place,

352
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:21,364
you're supposed to trust
the ace with the last ball.

353
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:24,668
(internal) I know
that... but still...

354
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:31,441
[KOSHI, internal]
I can't send Asahi a ball he's
not expecting and make him deal
with a triple block.

355
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:38,816
[ASAHI] A spiker can only go
for a kill... after a setter
sends him the ball.

356
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:44,154
[KOSHI]
Please... let me set for you
one more time, okay?

357
00:20:45,856 --> 00:20:49,993
[ASAHI]
And the set only exists because
the libero kept the ball in
play.

358
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:55,265
[YU]
Don't ever give up on a ball...
not while I'm keeping it in for
you!

359
00:20:57,234 --> 00:21:01,539
[ASAHI]
So when I go to do my job, I'm
not alone.

360
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,611
[ASAHI]
Everyone else was doing theirs,
but I... I...

361
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,614
[TOBIO]
It's impossible to win all by
yourself.

362
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:13,784
[SHOYO]
I mean, come on. That is why
they call you the Ace!

363
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:16,219
[DAICHI]
Because if you still love
volleyball...

364
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,559
[YU]
You have to ask the setter for
another chance, Asahi! You're
the ace!

365
00:21:23,393 --> 00:21:25,495
I'm free!

366
00:21:25,596 --> 00:21:30,868
[KOSHI] Shimada!
[ASAHI] SUGAAAAAAA!

367
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:31,635
(gasp)

368
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:33,537
Over here!

369
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:44,615
[KOSHI, internal]
Right... our ace is waiting. He
wants me to send it his way.

370
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,587
(internal) I'll set high,
not too far from the net.

371
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:54,357
Asahi's favorite toss, the one
I've given him so many times.

372
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:56,727
[KOSHI]
It's a simple one,

373
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:59,329
but I'll send it with as
much accuracy as I can.

374
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:01,899
Why would you bother
encouraging them to do that?

375
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,834
You know we have
to block him.

376
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:07,004
Obviously; it's meaningless
if we just let him through.

377
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,541
(panicked wail)

378
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:13,977
[ASAHI, internal]
My team has my back.

379
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:17,214
And my setter knows exactly
what works best for me.

380
00:22:17,314 --> 00:22:19,349
[ASAHI, internal]
Who could ask for more?

381
00:22:19,449 --> 00:22:21,585
(internal) Somewhere
along the way...

382
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:25,723
I let myself forget the most
simple and natural thing about
this game.

383
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:30,393
That I'll never have
to fight alone!

384
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:33,897
(internal) I will land this hit.

385
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:41,271
(happy)

386
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:43,541
(happy)

387
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:45,242
(focused)

388
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:47,845
(breathless)

389
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:50,581
[ASAHI]
Because I'm the Ace!

390
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,544
[KEI]
Tanaka, would you stop crying
and focus on blocking, please?

391
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:29,279
[RYUNOSUKE]
What?! I‐I'm not crying,
stupid! This is just‐

392
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:31,782
[KEI]
Right, it's sweat, you've
said that a thousand times.

393
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:33,350
[RYUNOSUKE]
It's just a runny nose.

394
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,954
[KEI]
Whatever. Next Haikyu!!
"The Dream".

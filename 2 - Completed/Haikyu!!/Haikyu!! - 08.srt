1
00:00:03,606 --> 00:00:04,907
(gasp)

2
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,710
[TOBIO, internal]
A perfect receive.

3
00:00:16,377 --> 00:00:18,547
[SHOYO, internal]
Is this who they meant?

4
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:20,381
[YU]
Huh?

5
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:23,685
Uh? Are you
shorter than me?

6
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:26,421
Gah! Hey! You had better
watch what you say to me!

7
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:32,828
Whoa, I am so sorry! Um
Anyway... I just wanted to
know how tall you are.

8
00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:35,564
I'm 5'2, that good
enough for ya?!

9
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:38,399
(internal) He's barely
in the 5‐foot range!

10
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:41,369
Wha... what's
with you?

11
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:45,373
Somebody to look down at...
I haven't had that feeling
since middle school!

12
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:48,376
You freaking kidding me!
You're not looking THAT
far down!

13
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:52,113
Huh? Long time no
see, Nishinoya!

14
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:54,115
[YU] Heey, how's
it goin', Tanaka?
[SHOYO] Huh?

15
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:55,651
[DAICHI KOSHI]
Nishinoya!

16
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,118
[YU] Yo!

17
00:00:57,218 --> 00:00:59,120
[DAICHI]
Oh, that's right,
you haven't met yet.

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,756
Nishinoya's a second‐year.

19
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:03,659
[SHOYO TOBIO] Hey!
[YU] Cool, nice to meet you,
first‐years!

20
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,362
Hey, I got a question for the
angry‐looking guy that just
threw that serve!

21
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:09,898
Where did you
come from?

22
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:11,132
Went to Kitagawa.

23
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:13,068
Seriously?! That's a
great school;

24
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:14,870
no wonder you're
so talented!

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,039
I played against those guys
in middle school and they
beat us 2 to 1!

26
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:22,277
[YU] They had someone back then
who could serve even better than
you!
[DAICHI KOSHI] Okay, looks like

27
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:25,547
Um... anyway, so um where
did you go to middle school?

28
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:27,649
Chidori‐yama!
(surprised)

29
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:30,819
Wow, they're pretty good
too! Why'd you come here?

30
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:34,990
[TOBIO]
Is it... because you heard
Coach Ukai was coming back?

31
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,027
Not really... I wanted to come
back here because... Well...

32
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:41,563
[SHOYO TOBIO]
(serious)

33
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:46,167
...Karasuno's school uniforms
for female students...
are the hottest!

34
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:48,003
[SHOYO] Uh?
[TOBIO] Hm?

35
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:49,404
But not just that!

36
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:51,206
The girls themselves aren't half
bad either!

37
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:54,209
Whoo! But most of all... Yeow!

38
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:56,845
OUR uniforms are awesome
too.. And black!

39
00:01:56,945 --> 00:02:00,081
[YU]
My middle school had
blazers, so I've always
like military style...

40
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,283
And they just
have to be black!

41
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:03,919
[RYUNOSUKE]
I know what you mean brotha!

42
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,921
So the uniforms are perfecto...

43
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,488
All the ladies are beautiful...

44
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:11,026
And a short commute!
It was a no‐brainer! Hm?!

45
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:15,631
[YU] Ah! Omigod it's Kiyoko!
Come to my arms, sweet mama!
[KIYOKO] (screaming)(slapping)

46
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:19,134
[KOSHI] So I guess hasn't
changed all that much has he.
[SHOYO] He's like a horny
tornado...

47
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:26,074
[DAICHI]
I know right... He can be pretty
noisy... But whenever he gets
focused on the game...

48
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:28,176
[DAICHI]
Not so much.

49
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:31,379
So... Where's Asahi?
Is he back yet?

50
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,349
[DAICHI] Ah... Well, uh...
[KOSHI] Ah... (troubled)

51
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:37,519
[YU]
Ah? Tch!

52
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:39,655
[YU] Damn coward!
[SHOYO TOBIO] (startled)

53
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:42,558
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey Noya! Show some respect
for your upperclassman‐

54
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:45,861
Oh Shaddap! He's a scared little
crybaby and you know it!

55
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:48,997
If Asahi's not coming back
then neither am I!

56
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,567
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey! Noya, wait!

57
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:34,035
[YU]
My job... is just to
keep the ball in play.

58
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:40,876
The sky belongs to the spikers.
I can't compete in their space.

59
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:45,346
[YU]
But if I can just keep the ball
up in the air... I know I can
trust the ace to nail it.

60
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:52,487
No matter what happens, even
if it bounces off a wall of
blockers, I won't let it hit
the floor.

61
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:54,990
[YU]
So don't change a thing.

62
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,728
Ask me for the ball just
one more time... Ace!

63
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,801
[SHOYO]
Uh, hey!

64
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:06,868
[YU]
Hm?

65
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:09,370
You're a libero...
um right, Nishiya?

66
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,006
You're on the defense.

67
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:14,442
It's NishiNOya... Why do
you think I'm a libero...

68
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:15,944
Because I'm short?

69
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:19,080
Huh? Course not.
You're good at receives.

70
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,616
Hm?

71
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:22,618
[SHOYO]
That's the right fit for
the libero position

72
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:25,554
because solid receives are the
backbone of the defense, right?

73
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:28,423
Look at you... You really
know your stuff, huh?

74
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:32,360
The Captain says you're
the guardian of Karasuno
or something like that!

75
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,563
Huh?! Guardian, where'd
that come from?!

76
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:39,535
I‐It's not like I'm that big
of a deal; that's kind of
embarrassing, actually...

77
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:43,071
He really said that?
Mm‐hm, mm‐hm!

78
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:46,675
[YU]
Does he think giving me a
badass nickname is enough
to make me come back?!

79
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,476
I mean, he's not wrong, but...

80
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:50,746
D‐Dammit, Daichi,
that's not fair!

81
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:53,314
I... still really
suck at receiving...

82
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:56,918
[SHOYO]
And it's kinda the most
important part of the game.

83
00:05:57,018 --> 00:05:58,286
Hm?

84
00:05:58,386 --> 00:06:00,355
Could you teach
me... Nishi...

85
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:02,858
[SHOYO]
... I mean, Mister
Upperclassman!

86
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,061
(shocked)

87
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:10,566
[SHOYO] Uhhh...
[YU] Look.

88
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,970
[YU]
After practice I'm gonna treat
you to some ice cream!

89
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,606
[SHOYO] Huh?
[YU] I'm your Upperclassman.

90
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:21,009
And that's what
upperclassmen do!

91
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:22,744
(happy) Does that mean...?

92
00:06:22,844 --> 00:06:25,246
[YU]
That doesn't mean I'm gonn
come back to volleyball club.‐

93
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:27,448
I'm just gonna teach you how
to do receives, that's all!

94
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:29,150
[SHOYO]
Thank you!

95
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,587
(sigh)

96
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:34,990
[YU]
Okay, I'll show you again.

97
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,124
[CHIKARA HISASHI]
Hm?

98
00:06:36,224 --> 00:06:41,630
[YU]
Schwoom.. swish.. and bam!
You got it?

99
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,664
[SHOYO KEI] Huh?
[TADASHI] Hm?

100
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:44,099
[RYUNOSUKE]
I told you...

101
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,333
people who act on instinct

102
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,135
really suck at putting
stuff into words.

103
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:48,403
Oh I don't know...

104
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:50,005
I'm pretty sure I understood
what he meant.

105
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:52,407
Yeah, that's 'cause
you're the same way...

106
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:54,442
It's all sound effects, it's
like... Whamajam!

107
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:58,179
and "kablooey!" and
stuff... You're like a
bunch of five‐year‐olds.

108
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,214
Huh?

109
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,481
A libero, huh?

110
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:02,183
That's an interesting
position.

111
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:06,555
[DAICHI]
It is. The libero specializes in
defense... A digger.

112
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:08,790
They're not allowed to
make serves or spikes.

113
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,061
Instead, they maintain the
rearguard position and keep the
ball from hitting the floor.

114
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:17,198
So I guess that's why you
called him the guardian...
That's impressive!

115
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:21,002
If we can convince him to
come back, I think the
team'll be in great shape.

116
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:24,072
[YU] Man, you guys are giants!
How tall are you?
[DAICHI] He may be small,
but he's got a huge presence

117
00:07:24,172 --> 00:07:26,374
[TADASHI] Tsukki is...
[KEI] What did I tell you?

118
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:28,510
[DAICHI] I'd feel a lot safer
with him on our side.
[TADASHI] Sorry, Tsukki,
I forgot.

119
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,847
It's at least good to see
Nishinoya still hasn't lost
his touch, isn't it?

120
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:34,550
I heard he trained through
his entire suspension...

121
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,818
He was gettin' it on
with the ladies' teams.

122
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:39,387
Haha! Just like Hinata!

123
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:42,791
Um hey, Nishinoya?
Huh?

124
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:45,561
Who's that Asahi guy you
were talking about before?

125
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:48,864
Dude! That's the one
thing you shouldn't say!

126
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:52,934
He's Karasuno's Ace...
Well, s'posta be.

127
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:57,405
The Ace, huh?
(internal) So, we do have one.

128
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:59,975
What are you all
speechless for?

129
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:02,544
That's what...
I wanna become!

130
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:07,148
Huh? Really?
A shorty like you?

131
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:09,518
[SHOYO]
(surprised) (sad)

132
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:11,953
[SHOYO] Huh?
[YU] I like your style!

133
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:14,389
You wanna be the ace because
it's flashy and cool, right?

134
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:17,893
Hell yeah, buddy! You
can be the ace if you
set your mind to it!

135
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:22,698
[YU] To tell the truth, you're
a lot more promising than the
guy we have! (laugh)
[SHOYO] Huh...

136
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:26,034
Of course... everybody out there
wishes they were the ace.

137
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:28,236
Yeah! That's 'cause
the ace is the best!

138
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:30,806
[YU]
I mean even the WORD "ace" is
awesome, right!

139
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:34,075
"Setter" and "libero"
sound kinda plain and
boring, you know?

140
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:36,444
[TOBIO] (annoyed)
[KOSHI] Just let it go...

141
00:08:36,545 --> 00:08:39,214
But still... There's
one thing...

142
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:42,684
that the crowd loves even
more than a great spike.

143
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:49,124
(CROWD cheering)
[YU] Make a wicked
receive and they go
crazy for you every time!

144
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:51,660
[YU]
This game is "tall beats all"...

145
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,565
So if you're a bit on the short
side... libero's one of the only
options you got.

146
00:08:56,665 --> 00:09:00,702
But I'll tell you one thing...
I don't play the position
because of how tall I am.

147
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:05,473
[YU]
Even if I was 6 feet tall...
I'd still be out there digging
the ball out.

148
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:07,075
(SHOYO amazed)

149
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:10,345
[YU]
Not being able to spike or
block doesn't mean anything...

150
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:15,984
In volleyball, you can never
lose unless the ball touches
the floor.

151
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:20,656
And the only one who keeps
it in the sky... is me!

152
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:22,624
Whoa... Amazing!

153
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:26,461
Ah‐hey, cut it out! You're
making it all weird when you
freak out like that!

154
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:30,298
[YU] Look I'll get you two ice
creams if you just chill,
alright?!
[SHOYO] Okay!

155
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:34,369
[YU] So, future ace,
what's your specialty?
[SHOYO] Huh?

156
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:38,607
Well uh, you said you
were bad at receiving...
So, what's your thing?

157
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:42,310
[SHOYO]
Well, it's not... I‐I'm uh...

158
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,812
Huh? Speak up.

159
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:46,047
A... decoy.

160
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:48,850
Why do you say it like
it's something bad?

161
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:54,623
Well, next to "ace" and
"guardian" and all that stuff...
decoy sounds kinda stupid,
right?

162
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:56,658
Who gives a damn
what it sounds like?

163
00:09:56,758 --> 00:09:57,859
Yeah, but...

164
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,795
[YU]
If having you as a
decoy makes it

165
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:02,564
so a spiker can score a point...

166
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:07,168
...then your job is important...
just as important as theirs is!

167
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:09,037
Okay...

168
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:12,908
[KOSHI]
Now maybe all those powerful
spikes we hit'll finally earn
us some points...

169
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:15,043
since we've gotten
ourselves a good decoy.

170
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:18,279
This Hinata‐Kageyama combo
should come in handy.

171
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:19,881
Mm‐hm.

172
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,482
You do remember what
Takeda told us, right...

173
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,219
I think things really are
gonna be changing for us.

174
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:27,422
[DAICHI]
Let's just hope it's
a GOOD change.

175
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:29,457
[KOSHI]
(laughing) True that.

176
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,329
[TAKEDA]
I realize I'm asking a lot here.

177
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:37,799
Look, I'll be the first
to admit that I don't know what
I'm doing

178
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:42,103
and I need your help. Those
guys have so much potential.

179
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:46,141
Can't you find it in your heart
to help them out? Please.

180
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:51,212
(exhale) You don't know when
quit, do you, Takeda?

181
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:54,215
No sir... It's my
only real strength.

182
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:57,218
Ask me all you want, and
I'm still gonna tell you no.

183
00:10:57,318 --> 00:11:01,056
[KEISHIN]
My grandpa was the super famous
coach, not me...

184
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:03,925
I told you, I'm not
the coaching type.

185
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,563
[KEISHIN]
Listen, Specs, I understand you
need somebody,

186
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:13,535
but it just ain't me.
Honestly... I think the
name's all you're after.

187
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:15,771
There is some
truth to that...

188
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:18,139
Coach Ukai was all
we ever had...

189
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:20,308
And I don't know
who else to ask...

190
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:23,111
But I am not the coach
those guys need...

191
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:25,681
I can't even run
a practice game.

192
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:29,985
And you think a brand‐name coach
is all it takes to fix that
little problem of yours?

193
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:31,887
[TAKEDA]
All I ask... is you try‐

194
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:33,955
[KEISHIN] Forget it.
(TAKEDA troubled)

195
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:36,725
I feel bad for you,
pal, I really do...

196
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:42,263
but the last thing I need is a
bunch of pain‐in‐the‐ass teenage
athletes to look after, okay.

197
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:43,865
I'll try again soon.

198
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:46,234
(irritated) Try again?!

199
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:49,237
What's it gonna take to
get rid of you?!

200
00:11:49,337 --> 00:11:52,107
[TAKEDA]
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

201
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:54,710
If you would just come
watch them play...

202
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,312
then you'd see why
it's so important.

203
00:11:57,412 --> 00:12:00,816
Guh... Yeah right!

204
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,051
I mean it! You're not
gonna change my mind!

205
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:08,323
Tch! Just go awaay...
Agh, jeez!

206
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,464
[KOSHI]
Here goes.

207
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:40,989
(hallway chatter)

208
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:43,725
[ASAHI]
Hey, Suga. Uh... it's
been a while, hasn't it?

209
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:48,229
[KOSHI]
Asahi... we would really like
you to come back to the team.

210
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,165
(awkward laugh)

211
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:53,735
[KOSHI]
Nishinoya just got back
from suspension y'know.

212
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:55,937
[ASAHI]
Really? Well that's good to
hear.

213
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:59,074
It makes me feel a lot better
knowing you guys have him
there to back you up.

214
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:00,942
That's how we feel about
YOU!

215
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:05,180
[KOSHI]
When you call for the
ball, everyone knows
they're in good hands!

216
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,115
Look I appreciate the thought...

217
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:10,886
But if I were to join the
team, I would just hold you
guys back like last time.

218
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:12,020
[KOSHI] Hear me out.
[ASAHI] (startled)

219
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,722
We've got this
amazing decoy,

220
00:13:13,822 --> 00:13:15,156
and as much as I
hate to say it,

221
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:17,526
the new first‐year
setter's great too!

222
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:20,962
You wouldn't have to carry the
whole team on your own anymore!

223
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:23,198
We've got some new
tactics now...

224
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:25,000
If we just had you
and Nishinoya back..

225
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,302
then maybe Karasuno
could be unstoppable again!

226
00:13:27,402 --> 00:13:30,772
Look we need our ace more
than ever! Things are just
starting to get better‐

227
00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:35,043
[GUY A]
Asahi! It's time for
career counseling!
[BOTH] Huh?

228
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:37,513
[ASAHI]
Sorry, I gotta go.

229
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,248
Huh...

230
00:13:40,348 --> 00:13:42,017
[SHOYO]
You go in first...

231
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:44,886
You're the one who wanted to
see the ace so bad, remember?

232
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:47,789
B.. But I'm way too scared
to walk into a third‐year
classroom!

233
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:48,924
[KOSHI]
Please wait, Asahi!

234
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:49,991
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Uh Asahi?

235
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:51,292
Uh? What's up?

236
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:52,928
[SHOYO] (gasp)
[KOSHI] Hey uh...

237
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:54,530
what are you first‐years
doing over here?

238
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,497
Uh, well we uh....

239
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:58,700
[TAKEDA]
Yes... yes!

240
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,235
Thank you so much!

241
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:04,272
Oh no, pleasure's all mine!
Yes... thank you!

242
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:08,243
(thrilled) Alright!

243
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:14,916
That'll be perfect! Finally...
things are about to change!

244
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:18,486
[KOSHI]
Anyway... These are the new
guys, Hinata and Kageyama.

245
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:21,422
Ah.. it's uh nice
to meet you guys.
Hello!

246
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:24,259
[ASAHI] So how many did
you get this year?
[SHOYO, internal] Wow, is
he taller than Tsukishima?

247
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:29,931
[KOSHI] Four. Not the numbers
we wanted, but they're all
promising.
[SHOYO, internal]

248
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:31,399
Heh... is that right?

249
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:34,235
[SHOYO, internal]
(realize) He seems nice though.

250
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:36,037
[ASAHI]
Good luck. Alright kid...

251
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:38,106
Huh? Are you gonna come
play with us or what?

252
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,509
[ASAHI] (taken aback)
[SHOYO] I want to be
the ace one day.

253
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:44,112
[SHOYO]
I was hoping to
see you in action!

254
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:47,215
[GUY A]
Hey Asahi! The teacher's
waiting for ya man!

255
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:51,019
Sorry... but I'm not
the ace anymore alright?

256
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:53,454
(confused)

257
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:57,158
So uh... did he get
hurt or something?

258
00:14:57,258 --> 00:15:00,529
Oh no... it's nothing
like that at all.

259
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:02,430
To be honest with you...

260
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:05,967
[KOSHI]
It might just be that Asahi's
lost his love for the game.

261
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:11,306
What?! But why?!
He's so big and tall and
he gets to be the ace!

262
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:16,512
[KOSHI]
See... Asahi was Karasuno's
biggest and strongest player.

263
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:21,049
Even in the trickiest
situations, he could
always score a point.

264
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:26,588
That's why we all depended on
him and considered him the ace
of the team... but then...

265
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,560
[TOBIO] Was it a bad game?
[SHOYO] Huh?

266
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,665
In one of our games... every
single one of Asahi's spikes
was completely shut down.

267
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:42,571
It was rough... And he's the
type who feels responsibility
for everything.

268
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:45,907
(SHOYO thinking)

269
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:47,676
[TOBIO]
What's wrong with you?

270
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:50,278
[SHOYO]
I don't think it's a
good enough reason to
hate volleyball.

271
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:53,248
Well, I dunno... It could've
been a number of things.

272
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:54,916
[SHOYO]
Yeah like what else?

273
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:56,618
[TOBIO]
Beats me. But hey...

274
00:15:56,718 --> 00:15:59,988
We don't actually KNOW for sure
that he hates volleyball, do we?

275
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:03,458
[SHOYO]
Ah? You're totally right

276
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:08,930
[YU]
Rolliiiing... Thunder!

277
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,299
[ALL]
Huh...?

278
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,769
(RYUNOSUKE laughing)
[KOSHI] Uh... well okay then.

279
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:15,737
[RYUNOSUKE]
Come on, dude, it's just
a rolling receive!

280
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:17,472
[TOBIO] What are
you yelling for?
(TADASHI snickering)

281
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:19,240
[KEI]
Are you hearing
yourself? (laughter)

282
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,209
You better watch your mouth,
you little first‐year brats,

283
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:24,279
or you're gonna regret it!‐
I'll make you do laps!
No, push‐ups!‐ You know what,

284
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:28,717
[SHOYO] That was awesome! Teach
me the Rolling Thunder too!
whatever you hate the most,
I'm gonna make you do a

285
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:33,488
[TAKEDA] Take five, guys!
Guess what? Great news!
[YU] Sure thing, kid!
[SHOYO] Sweet!

286
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,591
[TAKEDA]
So, the Golden Week
training camp.

287
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:37,959
We're all going
this year, aren't we?

288
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:39,460
[SHOYO, internal]
Training camp?

289
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:42,463
Yeah... All of us can surely
benefit from the practice.

290
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:46,401
That's excellent... cause on
the last day of said training
camp...

291
00:16:46,502 --> 00:16:48,970
...I've arranged us
a practice gaaaame!

292
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,938
[ALL]
Whoaaa!

293
00:16:50,038 --> 00:16:51,172
[RYUNOSUKE]
Wow, Take!

294
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:52,440
You're really pulling
your weight!

295
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,342
[KOSHI]
Who are we gonna be playing?

296
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,078
It Nekoma High School...
They're in Tokyo.

297
00:16:57,178 --> 00:17:01,750
People describe them
as... catlike.

298
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,318
[SHOYO]
Catlike?

299
00:17:03,418 --> 00:17:05,621
[RYUNOSUKE]
Yeah, we actually know
who those guys are...

300
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:08,023
Our old coach was
rivals with their coach.

301
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:09,591
We used to play
them all the time.

302
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:10,759
[SHOYO]
Oh...

303
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,761
[KOSHI]
Oh, that's right!
They called it...

304
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:16,297
"Cats and Birds!"... the
famous trashcan showdown!

305
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:18,734
[KEI]
I can't believe people
actually came to see that.

306
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:23,238
But wait.. We haven't
played that school in
a while... so why now?

307
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:26,074
It's simple... but I'll
explain all the details later.

308
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:32,681
In short, I found out they were
our adversary... and then...
I just had to stage a rematch.

309
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:34,415
(surprised)

310
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:38,887
If we go up against Nekoma
High... he'll change his tune.

311
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:41,923
[KEISHIN]
(sneeze) Ugh...

312
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:45,460
[DAICHI]
Great! Looking
forward to it then!

313
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:47,629
Let's make this practice
game count guys!

314
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:48,964
[ALL]
Right!

315
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:50,632
Tokyo, huh?

316
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:54,202
Those little city boys...
They have no clue what
they're in for!

317
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:55,937
[KEI]
Did you say "city boys"?

318
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:58,239
[RYUNOSUKE]
What's it to you, F‐Four‐Eyes?!
(DAICHI awkward laugh)

319
00:17:58,339 --> 00:17:59,775
Hey Daichi.
Hm?

320
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:04,012
I'm sorry... But I can't
go to the practice game.

321
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:05,847
What're you talking about?

322
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:08,149
[SHOYO] Hey! I bet Tokyo
schools are tough!
[YU] Kageyama's a great guy,

323
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:10,151
[SHOYO] They gotta be right?
[YU] and even though the other
first‐years are kinda rough,

324
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,453
[YU] they're a fun group.
[TOBIO] How should I know?
Just pipe down.

325
00:18:12,554 --> 00:18:17,258
I think with a little
time... this team'll be
something special.

326
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:21,697
[YU]
I want to play with you guys...
but...

327
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:25,200
But if I played in the game...
and we were to actually win...

328
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,938
then well it would be like
saying that we don't need
Asahi and I... I just can't.

329
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:31,607
(surprised)

330
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:33,542
[YU]
We've been teammates
for so long.

331
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:36,645
I'm sorry if I'm
being selfish.

332
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:39,515
Look I get it... But I
still want you to come
to the camp okay.

333
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:41,249
Hm? You mean it?
(surprised)

334
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:43,018
[SHOYO]
Hey Noya! That Thunder thing!

335
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:44,219
Will you show me how to do it?!

336
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,453
Well then?

337
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:46,454
(unsure)

338
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:47,623
Huh?

339
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:49,591
Huh?

340
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:51,727
[DAICHI] Have a good night!

341
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,094
[ALL]
See ya!

342
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:54,963
(TOBIO drinking)
[SHOYO] (drinking) Ahhhh...

343
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:58,366
Do you think if Asahi
came back, everything
would work out for us?

344
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,702
And what about Noya, huh?

345
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:01,903
I dunno.

346
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:03,505
I don't get it...

347
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:06,374
Sugawara said Asahi's the kind
of guy who feels responsible...

348
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:10,011
... but I think HE
might feel bad too.

349
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:12,881
They both feel like what
happened was their fault...

350
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,551
... but it's not like
they can win alone.

351
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:17,753
[SHOYO]
No way, you don't
get to say that!

352
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:21,156
What happened to Kageyama's
favorite catchphrase,
anyway huh?!

353
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:23,892
[SHOYO, imitating TOBIO]
"Receives.. and sets.. AND
spikes...

354
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:26,728
I'd rather do everything in
the whole game all by myself."

355
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:28,697
[TOBIO]
Would you just freakin' drop it!

356
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:30,866
[SHOYO, imitating TOBIO]
"Look at me, I'm a dumb jerk..."

357
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,568
(roar)

358
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,403
(land)

359
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:37,639
We're all on the same side...

360
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:39,440
So we should be acting like it.

361
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,542
Huh?

362
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:44,045
I just wish we got along
better... don't you?

363
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:46,582
(troubled)

364
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:56,357
(serious)

365
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:58,727
Yeah it's nice of you to think
of me and everything.

366
00:19:58,827 --> 00:20:02,698
And I can tell it's important
to you, but I'm not really
interested okay?

367
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:04,866
Look! If you don't come
back to volleyball club,

368
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:08,436
the upperclassmen are
never gonna cheer up‐
(gut‐punched) (suffering)

369
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:10,706
[TOBIO] Do you ever shut up?
(ASAHI laughing)

370
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:14,009
[ASAHI] You two are funny.
But, listen to me.
[SHOYO] Huh?

371
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:18,113
I'm sorry but... It's just I've
forgotten what it feels like...

372
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:23,719
to send the ball through a
wall of blockers. It seems
impossible to me now.

373
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:27,155
[ASAHI]
I just know I'd fail..
again.

374
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:31,593
[ASAHI] Just thinking about it
freaks me out and it's just too
much for me right now.
[SHOYO] Huh?

375
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:34,129
[SHOYO]
Well, this might sound cocky
coming from a first‐year...

376
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:36,732
but I still think it's
important for me to say it.

377
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:38,834
Whatever it is you
can tell me okay.

378
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:40,769
I know what you mean.

379
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:43,705
[SHOYO SHOYO]
I'm short and I don't
have great technique,

380
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:46,742
so the blockers used to stop
me all the time... But...

381
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:51,179
Thanks to Kageyama's amazing
sets I can get past anybody now!

382
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,380
Hmm...

383
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,982
[SHOYO]
The wall just fades away...

384
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:57,052
...and then the view of
the other side is totally clear!

385
00:20:57,152 --> 00:21:02,023
[ASAHI, internal]
The view... I think I understand
what he's talking about.

386
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:05,226
[SHOYO]
And once I reach the top
of my jump, the ball hits my
hand...

387
00:21:05,326 --> 00:21:09,230
And when the weight of it,
sorta leaves a sting in my
palm...

388
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,632
I love that!

389
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:14,002
[ASAHI, internal]
I know that feeling too.

390
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:17,305
You know... I'm really
jealous of you...

391
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:21,342
The way things are.. I don't
have the height to clear a
wall.. or the power...

392
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:26,648
But you've got both! Look
I know you might've had a
rough time in the past...

393
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:30,686
[SHOYO] ...but you scored a
lot more times than you got
blocked, right?
(ASAHI stunned)

394
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:34,055
I mean c'mon... That is why
they call you the ace!

395
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:35,423
(gasp)

396
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:37,926
(simmering)

397
00:21:38,026 --> 00:21:43,899
(bell ringing)
[TOBIO]
Oh? Let's head back, Hinata...
Hey.. Dude we gotta go.

398
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:46,735
[SHOYO]
(dazed) (pout)

399
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,205
[TOBIO] Hey uh...
[ASAHI] Hm?

400
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:53,141
It's impossible to win
all by yourself...

401
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:54,843
You need the help
of your teammates.

402
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:57,779
[TOBIO]
I'm still getting used
to that idea myself,

403
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:02,483
so I can't really talk, but
it's true... See you around.

404
00:22:07,255 --> 00:22:10,425
(courtyard chatter)

405
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:11,593
[GUY B]
Ready to go?

406
00:22:11,693 --> 00:22:13,194
[GUY C]
Yeah, wanna get some food?

407
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:17,465
(sneakers squeaking
on the court)
[ASAHI] Ah? Uh...

408
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:22,403
[SHOYO]
Come on! Gimme another one!

409
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:25,040
[TOBIO]
Alright, shut up,
I get it! Ready?

410
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,941
[SHOYO]
Yeah!

411
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,208
(gasp)

412
00:22:33,314 --> 00:22:36,852
[SHOYO]
And once I reach the top
of my jump.. the ball hits my
hand...

413
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:40,589
And when the weight of
it.. sorta leave a sting
in my palm...

414
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:43,091
[SHOYO]
I love that!

415
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,494
[ASAHI, internal]
I know...

416
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:50,899
[ASAHI]
I know what he means.

417
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:25,561
[TOBIO]
I hope Asahi comes back soon.

418
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:27,462
[SHOYO] He's got chin stubble.
[TOBIO] What?

419
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:30,498
[SHOYO]
Maybe if I could grow
stubble like that, I'd
be more like an ace!

420
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,200
[SHOYO]
Do you think hair
tonic would help?

421
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,802
[TOBIO]
Who cares, dumbass?!

422
00:24:33,902 --> 00:24:37,205
[TOBIO]
Next time on Haikyu!!
"A Toss For The Ace."

1
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:10,084
[Spectator 1]:
Hey, Karasuno's
swapping setters.

2
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:22,630
Don't feel bad...

3
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,799
We just need to change
up the rhythm.

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,834
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:30,371
I AM worried about him.

6
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:36,177
[Koshi]:
But we can't have both of them
losing their grip at once.

7
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:39,514
I already promised you that
I'd be the one to beat you!

8
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:41,949
Hey, Hinata! He's
gonna get ma‐

9
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,451
Don't you dare lose
to those guys first!

10
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,325
Well, I haven't
lost yet, have I?

11
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:53,060
The game is still on.

12
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:57,398
He is gonna
KILL you!

13
00:00:57,498 --> 00:01:00,868
I guess there was
no need to panic.

14
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:03,705
Kageyama... I want you
to stay ready.

15
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:05,573
Just take a few minutes
to cool off.

16
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:09,010
[Keishin]:
Maybe you'll learn something
from your upperclassman.

17
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:44,572
You!

18
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:45,507
You!

19
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,174
You!

20
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:47,909
You!

21
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:48,810
And you!

22
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,545
Aw yeah!

23
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:54,081
I hope you're ready!...
We are getting this point!

24
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,419
[Team Karasuno]:
Yeah!

25
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:03,991
What?

26
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,761
Kageyama, you're making
that ugly face again.

27
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,630
It's my FACE,
asshole!

28
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,167
You just look so tense...
And you've been so quiet.

29
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:15,036
I'm sure you're just
really deep in thought

30
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:16,704
about something, right?

31
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:19,707
[Shoyo]:
But you're hard to read when
you go all silent like that.

32
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:23,444
So you're saying I'm not
talking to the team?

33
00:03:23,545 --> 00:03:25,179
Yup, you've been
quieter in this game

34
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,148
than in any game
we've ever played.

35
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,883
[Shoyo]:
It's weird!

36
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:33,320
Damn, have I gotten so bad that
THIS idiot gets to lecture ME?

37
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,858
Hey.. that setter Karasuno
just put in... Number 2...?

38
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,161
[Book‐holding Spectator]:
Looks like he's
a third‐year!

39
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,362
What?!

40
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:42,864
I wonder why they would
replace a guy like that

41
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:44,431
with a first‐year in
the starting lineup?!

42
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:47,434
Hey, Daichi! Why are you
being so quiet today?

43
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:48,603
Huh?

44
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:50,572
We can't have our
captain losin' his cool!

45
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:52,039
Oh, uh...
sorry.

46
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,741
Nobody lectures
Daichi!

47
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:54,842
'Cept for him.

48
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:56,343
[Koshi]:
Tsukishima, c'mere.

49
00:03:57,812 --> 00:04:02,717
I'm not sure what Mr. Optimism
is actually good at...

50
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:05,953
...but from his warmup, it's
clear that he's meticulous

51
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,923
and serious about
what he does.

52
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:09,957
Look, Iwa...

53
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:11,458
Number 2's got
a low block,

54
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,895
so I want you to aim for
a straight‐down where he is.

55
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:15,296
Sure.

56
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,736
Nice receive!

57
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:22,436
Tanaka!

58
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:23,437
Gotcha!

59
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:26,040
Iwa!

60
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,576
Okay... Straight down
at the low blocker!

61
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:32,246
Iwa!

62
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,155
Rejected! guess they must've
seen that straight‐down coming.

63
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:43,658
Yeah! That was
a really nifty trick!

64
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,126
Right before
Seijoh spiked it,

65
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:48,329
they swapped their
blocker positions.

66
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:51,566
That was great, Tsukishima!
You pulled one over on them!

67
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,434
That.. wasn't
just me...

68
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:55,737
Y'see, I'm a
low blocker...

69
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,004
so whenever we play
a tough team

70
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:59,273
I'm always
getting targeted.

71
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:01,776
And I figured they
would be no exception.

72
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:04,612
It comes in pretty handy
to have someone as tall as you

73
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:05,613
next to me!

74
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:08,482
Um... thanks,
I guess...

75
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:09,717
Yikes.

76
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:11,252
Sorry about that.

77
00:05:12,654 --> 00:05:14,556
Here we go!

78
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,724
Hinata, c'mere!

79
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:18,693
[Daichi]:
All you, Tsukki!

80
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:21,896
Here!

81
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:23,598
[Toru]:
Nice receive!

82
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,133
Man, they're giving
it right back to them!

83
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,602
Oh, a quick attack!

84
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:30,505
[Takinoue]:
And an A‐Quick!

85
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:37,078
Woohoo!

86
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:41,015
Hinata, that
was freakin' great!

87
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:43,450
Yeah, well you guessed
right, Sugawara!

88
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,887
Next time they're able to neatly
send it back to the setter,

89
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:48,523
they'll probably do a
quick attack in the center.

90
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,324
But I want you
to move slowly

91
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:52,760
and delay your
jump a little bit.

92
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,461
Y'got that!

93
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,497
It was frustrating to have
to watch from the sidelines,

94
00:05:56,598 --> 00:05:59,166
but I think being outside the
game allowed me to assess

95
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:00,668
the situation more calmly.

96
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:02,837
I was able to see
the game with new eyes.

97
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:06,240
So the time I spent
not playing was useful too.

98
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,110
The energy on our side
is really amping up now!

99
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,411
Yeah...

100
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:11,913
You're worried,
aren't you?

101
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:13,114
Huh?

102
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:15,149
Because you benched
Kageyama, right.

103
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,018
And he's
so prideful...

104
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:19,787
Are you afraid that he'll get
all bent out of shape over it?

105
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:23,057
[Takeda]:
He'll be alright.

106
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:25,326
I think Kageyama's pride is
the main source of his power

107
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,530
and talent. That, and his
undying determination to be

108
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,365
a better player,
make him exceptional.

109
00:06:31,465 --> 00:06:33,000
[Daichi]:
Give us one
more, Tsukki!

110
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,769
[Toru]:
One point
to break it!

111
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,203
[Team Seijoh]:
Yeah!

112
00:06:36,303 --> 00:06:38,472
[Shoyo]:
Okay, what attack
are we doing next?

113
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:41,208
My technical skill's not
as good as Kageyama's is,

114
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:43,277
so I can't always
toss perfect sets...

115
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:45,980
but hand signals might help
us communicate our next move

116
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,615
during a game.

117
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:55,690
When an outsider looks at Suga,
they only see one thing.

118
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,461
[Daichi]:
A poor third‐year who got
replaced by a first‐year.

119
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:02,263
He didn't use
his code words!

120
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:05,800
Kageyama's out, so it can't
be that insane quick attack!

121
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,535
Right, duh!

122
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:12,139
But what they don't know, is
that Suga has spent enough time

123
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:15,577
[Daichi]:
on the sidelines to know
exactly what to do...

124
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:19,246
He's just as much of
an asset as Kageyama!

125
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:21,783
Gotcha!

126
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:24,285
When it comes
to actual ability,

127
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:26,621
I pale in comparison
to Kageyama,

128
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:30,424
but I've been watching this team
a lot longer than he has.

129
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:34,696
[Koshi]:
I know I don't have what
it takes to beat Seijoh...

130
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:37,932
...but my friends are
amazing at what they do!

131
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,503
This point will turn the tide!

132
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:42,637
Right!

133
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:52,714
Good effort,
Hinata.

134
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:53,948
Hey, guys.

135
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:55,883
[Hajime]:
Serve's up!

136
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:57,084
[Hanamaki]:
One point!

137
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:58,886
Oh... great.

138
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,455
(fangirls squealing)

139
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:04,258
[Tobio]:
Oikawa's serve.

140
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,893
Bring it on!

141
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:10,397
[Crowd]:
Oooooooolé

142
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:11,966
Leave it to me!
I'll get it!

143
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:15,136
The old
hubby‐wife play.

144
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:17,371
It happens when two
receivers get mixed up.

145
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:19,574
Sorry, I should've
gone for it myself.

146
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:22,243
I was too close!
It's cool!

147
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:29,016
[Crowd]:
Oooooooolé

148
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:30,618
[Keishin]:
Front line!

149
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:35,823
[Shimada]:
Set point
for Seijoh.

150
00:08:35,923 --> 00:08:38,826
Damn... How many times
has Oikawa scored

151
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:40,461
with that
serve of his?!

152
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,496
[Shimada]:
If there was an ultimate
play in volleyball,

153
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:44,699
it would be scoring
all 25 points
Time to finish this.

154
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,001
with nothing but serves.
[Team Seijoh]:
Yeah!

155
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:50,171
[Shimada]:
The opponent never
gets a chance to attack.

156
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:52,507
That's what service
aces are all about.

157
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:54,942
I got it, it's miiine!

158
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,678
Okay!

159
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:03,785
Number 10 and Number 5
are after it...

160
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:06,888
[Hajime]:
No, it's a back attack!

161
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:11,192
[Hajime]:
Yeah, nice receive!

162
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,795
Hinata, right now,
do a direct!

163
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:16,598
[Shoyo]:
I've never done
a direct attack...

164
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:18,199
What the hell
was that?!

165
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,401
I‐I'm sorry, okay?!

166
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:25,640
[Koshi]:
Hey, guys.

167
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:28,576
I think I just
noticed something...

168
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:30,945
It kinda looks like Seijoh
carries out their quick attacks

169
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:33,881
a little bit slower than
we do... We should...

170
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:36,483
[Shoyo]:
Delay it by just a hair...

171
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,620
... and jump!

172
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:41,923
Get back!

173
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:43,424
[Mizoguchi]:
No!

174
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:51,966
It's out?!
Son of a‐

175
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,701
(whistle blows)

176
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,738
[Keishin]:
Switch sides. Let's go!

177
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:59,907
Come on, Hinata!
We'll get it next time.

178
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,475
Okay!

179
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:05,012
Agh, that was too close!
They figured out our timing!

180
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:08,115
[Toru]:
All their players are starting
to look before they leap now...

181
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:11,418
including the short one,
and he tends to blindly rely

182
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,454
on his instincts.

183
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:18,760
Here.

184
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,861
Here.

185
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:21,896
We'll go with the
current lineup.

186
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,798
[Team Karasuno]:
Sir!

187
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:29,170
[Keishin]:
Okay, our biggest obstacle
is Oikawa's serve, obviously.

188
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,206
So we're gonna
beef up our defense!

189
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:34,976
[Hajime]:
Karasuno's attacks
are pretty wild.

190
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:37,979
Just when we got into the right
mindset to handle that crazy

191
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,480
quick attack...

192
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:41,616
they decided they would try
to throw us off our game

193
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:43,350
by attacking
us like normal.

194
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,620
You're focusing way
too much on Number 10.

195
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,991
Iwa! Don't think too hard;
you'll run out of brain cells!

196
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:54,028
During the practice game,
we were scrutinizing Kageyama.

197
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:57,665
[Irihata]:
I didn't realize they
had another solid setter.

198
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:58,666
Listen.

199
00:10:58,766 --> 00:10:59,801
Yeah?

200
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:04,038
Uh, Kindaichi‐ Um I
mean... Onion Head.

201
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:07,208
Number 12's quick attack is a
little bit on the slow side...

202
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:09,410
I mean, don't
you think?

203
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:11,378
You're right, it is!

204
00:11:11,478 --> 00:11:13,515
It's like that guy
watches the ball forever

205
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:16,618
before he actually
goes in for the hit.

206
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,721
Sugawara's a control tower
they're not familiar with...

207
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:22,256
That oughta throw
these guys off.

208
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,025
He's different
from Kageyama.

209
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,629
Yeah... I put him in hoping
he'd bring the other kids

210
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:32,099
back to their senses...
but this works just as well.

211
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,268
We'll have to remember
this little strategy

212
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:36,337
in the future too.

213
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:37,038
Kageyama.

214
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:38,439
Uh‐huh.

215
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,241
Okay, so I understand
since we're both setters,

216
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:42,877
we're kinda supposed to be
competing for the same position

217
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:44,378
or whatever...

218
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:46,948
...but I just want
to play volleyball!

219
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:48,550
Uh, s‐same here.

220
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,217
Now that I'm actually
standing on the court,

221
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:52,720
I realize how tall the
Aoba‐Johsai guys are,

222
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,590
and how that makes me a walking
target for their spikes...

223
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,024
It's kinda scary.

224
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,894
But y'know what...
I know I'm okay, because...

225
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:03,064
Now I have you
right there behind me.

226
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:04,599
That's reassuring.

227
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,701
The points we make while
I'm on the court...

228
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:09,403
and the points we make with
you on the court...

229
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:11,806
...they're all
points for Karasuno.

230
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:14,108
So I will give it
my absolute best...

231
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:18,913
and you give it your best too...
That is how we'll beat Seijoh.

232
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,982
Yeah.

233
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:22,817
Are you crying or
something, Kageyama?

234
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,686
No I'm not, butt‐wad!

235
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,421
Don't yell at me! I was just
concerned about you, that's all!

236
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:30,892
Worry about yourself and that
lame direct you just screwed up!

237
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:33,728
Sh‐shut up! I've
never done it before!

238
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:35,763
Well there's a whole
lot more of those to come

239
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:37,799
when I get back
in the game!

240
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:42,870
[Daichi]:
Let's go!

241
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,806
Yeah!

242
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,695
[Daichi]:
Suga! You don't have
to get all introspective

243
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:09,163
and overthink this.

244
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:10,665
Uh, I won't.

245
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:12,700
We'll make a comeback
in the second set.

246
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,936
The first step
to achieving that...

247
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:17,972
[Daichi]:
is breaking
Oikawa's serve.

248
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,811
Seijoh's rotation is
the same as the first set,

249
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,980
but Karasuno moved
theirs up a little bit.

250
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,183
[Takinoue]:
Huh. Wonder why
they did that?

251
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:34,055
Yes! Ha!
Alright!

252
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:35,489
Nice, Tsukishima!

253
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,891
Uh, thanks.

254
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,492
[Koshi]:
Do that again, okay?

255
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:40,127
He's really nice...

256
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:42,697
He always compliments me
when I do good, too!
That's great...

257
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:45,833
[Chikara]:
It is, but Sugawara doesn't
do that just for the sake

258
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,335
of being friendly... I think
he talks to all the spikers

259
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:51,105
so he can get a feel for their
emotional state during the game.

260
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,676
Helps him decide how to set.
Because everyone's different.

261
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:57,879
[Chikara]:
Tsukishima, on the other hand,
is a special case,

262
00:13:57,979 --> 00:14:01,182
because unlike with the
older players, Sugawara doesn't

263
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:03,017
know much about him.

264
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:06,220
Oh what's that face for?
It looks like you're thinking

265
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,455
"Why should I be concerned
with how a jerk

266
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,757
like Tsukishima feels?"

267
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:11,926
Uh‐You don't know what
I'm thinking about!

268
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:13,928
'Kay it's sort
of like this...

269
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:16,864
You know how you adjust your set
if Hinata isn't able to hit it?

270
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:19,233
Yeah.. He'll just
swing at nothing.

271
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,302
Well, my point is,
our other spikers

272
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,571
have enough technical prowess
to hit the sets that aren't

273
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:25,272
tailored to
their strengths.

274
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:28,342
So maybe this sounds
sort of biased...

275
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:29,811
but you know, if you ask me...

276
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,446
we have some pretty
advanced spikers.

277
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:34,782
Uh, yeah, I agree
with that. Sure.

278
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:36,417
In that case...

279
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:39,353
...don't you think if they
were all hitting at 100%,

280
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:42,189
they'd be able to compete
with most any blocker

281
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,158
they were up against?

282
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:48,262
[Hanamaki]:
One point!

283
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:50,732
[Shoyo]:
Looks like the Great
King's up to serve.

284
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:58,172
[Toru]:
Serve‐receive W‐Formation!

285
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,107
[Keishin]:
When Oikawa serves...

286
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:03,310
We'll delegate our defense
to just a select few.

287
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,614
[Keishin]:
That serve of his
is a serious threat...

288
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:09,584
so a moment's hesitation
could be the end of us.

289
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:14,321
So, I say we tackle this using
our two outstanding receivers,

290
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:16,023
Nishinoya and Daichi.

291
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,760
We've never done
this formation in a game.

292
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,128
But I think you'll do fine.

293
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:22,363
We will!

294
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:24,832
[Shoyo]:
Wow!

295
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:26,768
They have a different
rotation this set...

296
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:28,803
I wonder why they
moved it slightly forward

297
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,304
from the first one.

298
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:32,874
[Takinoue]:
I'm assuming they
lined it up like this

299
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,342
to match with
Oikawa's serve.

300
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:38,913
Those serves cleaned
the floor with us in set 1...

301
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:42,483
not to mention the 5 points
we lost to service aces.

302
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:46,621
[Keishin]:
Until we can stand up to that
serve, we'll never beat Seijoh.

303
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,756
Here goes!

304
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:53,094
[Crowd]:
Ooooooooolé!

305
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:54,295
Daichi!

306
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:00,935
Yes!

307
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:03,304
[Takeda]:
Nice receive!

308
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:05,573
[Koshi]:
We really need to score
a point to break the cycle

309
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,942
of Oikawa's serve.

310
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:11,378
If we can, it'll make
a huge difference.

311
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:14,148
But it's gonna put a lot of
pressure on one person.

312
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,951
I'll send it to the player who
broke the flow in the first set

313
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:19,020
after Oikawa tried
to bring him down.

314
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,188
That'll get him
back on his feet.

315
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:22,389
Tanaka!

316
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:23,925
It's all up to you!

317
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:31,398
Yeah!

318
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:33,067
YEEEEEAAAAAH!

319
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:34,401
Who‐ho‐hoa!

320
00:16:34,502 --> 00:16:36,638
That's the
point breaker!

321
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:39,106
That was very
impressive, captain.

322
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:42,209
[Yu]:
Let's keep it up!

323
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:43,344
[Daichi]:
Tsukki!

324
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:45,046
[Chikara]:
You know, if you ask me...

325
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:46,914
we have some pretty
advanced spikers.

326
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,617
Don't you think if they
were all hitting at 100%...

327
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,620
they'd be able to compete
with most any blocker

328
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,355
they were
up against?

329
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,928
[Keishin]:
Man, our morale
is through the roof!

330
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:04,532
Seijoh's may have us beat in
experience and technical skill.

331
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:08,269
And it'll be a nightmare if
they can pick up a solid lead.

332
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:12,106
But if we hang in there, we
should be able to take control!

333
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:19,814
[Takinoue]:
Wow, it's anybody's
game right now.

334
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,684
I guess... but their
blockers are all over us.

335
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:26,153
Good job, Kindaichi! You're
figuring out all their patterns!

336
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,222
Uh, yes sir.

337
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:31,893
It's not that Mr. Sunshine
and Rainbows is a bad setter.

338
00:17:31,993 --> 00:17:34,762
His attacks are just so
textbook and predictable...

339
00:17:34,862 --> 00:17:38,199
He never rushes
a setup either.

340
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:41,703
Listen, Karasuno may have
a lot of offensive power,

341
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,539
but it's nothing we haven't
seen before from other teams

342
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,173
we've played, right?

343
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,243
Now let's leave these
losers in the dust.

344
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,347
Gotcha!

345
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,050
Y'know... At this point
in the game...

346
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,753
I think Seijoh's got a good
sense of what our setter's

347
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:00,454
gonna do next.

348
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:01,422
I think you're right.

349
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:02,489
[Matsukawa]:
Serve's up!

350
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,159
[Crowd]:
Ooooooooolé!

351
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:14,101
[Shimada]:
Seijoh scores
back‐to‐back.

352
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:17,572
Yeah, and the break is where
the flow really starts to move.

353
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:19,841
We need to
crank things up!

354
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:22,009
Karasuno's been using
their left players a lot

355
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,178
since they swapped out
their setter, haven't they?

356
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:26,581
Well, that's because each
of their lefts is a force

357
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:29,951
to be reckoned with...
Still... I'm sure they're easier

358
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:31,986
to deal with than that
number 10's constant

359
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:33,855
bobbing and weaving.

360
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:38,459
It's like there's a noose
tightening around my neck.

361
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,495
And yet I feel so calm.

362
00:18:41,596 --> 00:18:45,099
Impatience isn't
clouding my judgment.

363
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:48,970
I guess because I have a
clear goal right in front of me.

364
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,739
Yeah, let's
get that point!

365
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,375
[Tobio]:
I used to think that
if I got benched...

366
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:57,579
...it meant I wasn't
useful to the team anymore...

367
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,415
Honestly, that probably
WAS the reason back then.

368
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:03,084
But...

369
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,020
Now I have you right
there behind me.

370
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,189
That's reassuring.

371
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,792
Sugawara and I have
different strengths,

372
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:14,629
but I think our goal
is the same.

373
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:16,163
[Hajime]:
Left side!

374
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:19,466
[Koshi]:
Heads up!

375
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,202
[Yu]:
Open!

376
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:26,240
[Tobio]:
All I want is to
play volleyball!

377
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,676
I want to be
in this game!

378
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:32,346
[Koshi]:
I want to stay longer...
Just a little longer!

379
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:34,582
[Tobio]:
The intensity of the court...

380
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:39,153
[Koshi]:
Please... let me keep
playing with my team!

381
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:41,022
[Tobio]:
The rush of adrenaline...

382
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:42,657
[Koshi]:
I don't want to leave!

383
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:45,660
[Tobio]:
I want to be out there
fighting... and winning!

384
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,062
[Koshi]:
I want to make
these sets myself!

385
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:50,431
[Tobio/Koshi]:
I HAVE to!

386
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:51,599
So...

387
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:54,035
So I will give it
my absolute best...

388
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:56,504
and you give it
your best, too...

389
00:19:56,604 --> 00:19:58,172
and that...

390
00:19:58,272 --> 00:20:01,108
[Tobio/Koshi]:
That is how we're
going to win this game!

391
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,977
[Koshi]:
Nice receive!

392
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:09,383
YES!

393
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:10,417
Awesome block!

394
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,658
Sorry Hinata...

395
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,093
That last quick attack took me
longer than it should have.

396
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:20,728
Oh! No
it's fine...

397
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:23,197
[Spectator 1]:
They're calling for
Karasuno's number 9.

398
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:25,466
[Spectator 2]:
I guess they're
switching setters.

399
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:33,374
My time's running out.

400
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:34,509
[Asahi]:
Suga.

401
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:39,480
Send me the next ball, okay?
I'll make it count.

402
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:44,151
Right!

403
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:45,987
[Yutaro]:
Serve's up!

404
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:01,235
Amazing.

405
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:18,252
I hate to admit it, but...

406
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:21,656
Well, when Hinata
hits your sets...

407
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:24,692
somehow he looks
completely different.

408
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,831
And... I'm sure
you know this...

409
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:33,300
[Koshi]:
...but everyone on our team
is good at what they do.

410
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,169
Yeah.

411
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,171
So go wi‐

412
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:42,443
Let's win.

413
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:45,813
Right!

414
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:46,848
Good job.

415
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:48,249
Well done.

416
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,418
Yeah, You kept it neck and
neck against those guys.

417
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,487
That's because we're
a great team.

418
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:54,622
Listen here, kid...

419
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:56,524
From here on in, I think
we'll be pushing this

420
00:21:56,624 --> 00:21:59,260
setter route as
aggressively as we can.

421
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,765
Sure! Thank you, sir!

422
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,068
What was that?

423
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:10,037
Well, you are talking
in his setter language.

424
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:12,974
[Takeda]:
That's probably
music to his ears.

425
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:14,909
If everyone does
their best to succeed,

426
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:20,347
then I'm confident we
can beat Seijoh... But...

427
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:22,183
[Koshi]:
...to get the boost we need,

428
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:24,085
the best bet for Karasuno

429
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:25,352
is to have its greatest decoy

430
00:22:25,452 --> 00:22:28,289
working at 100%
of his potential.

431
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,060
And the one to
make that happen...

432
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,497
[Koshi]:
...will be you... Kageyama.

433
00:24:07,522 --> 00:24:08,923
[Toru]:
Welcome back, Tobio!

434
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:10,124
[Tobio]:
Watch it, pretty boy.

435
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:11,559
[Toru]:
Now, now, settle down.

436
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,628
We know you're not capable
of anything serious.

437
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:16,664
[Shoyo]:
Tsukishima, he's meaner than
you! You gonna take that?!

438
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:18,966
[Kei]:
It's not a
competition, Hinata...

439
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,769
Next Haikyu!!
"Evolution."

1
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:25,774
K‐Kageyama! What are
you plotting?!

2
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:27,442
Must be
something evil!

3
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:28,611
What's your problem?!

4
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:29,945
Yeah, he's not
plotting anything!

5
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:31,547
I think this is
just the first time

6
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:32,948
he's ever tried
to smile!

7
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:34,550
You didn't mean that the
way it sounded, right?

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,418
Oh, screw you, Hinata!

9
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:41,824
Our little grump is finally
showing his feelings!

10
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:43,291
Time to change it up...

11
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:45,293
Do you remember
the hand signals?

12
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:46,595
You ready?

13
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:48,831
Oh hey, did you hear about
the signals from Sugawara?

14
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:50,498
Yeah, he told me.

15
00:00:53,468 --> 00:00:54,770
All right!

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,605
Let's go all in!

17
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,240
You got it!

18
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,936
[Seijoh Cheer Leader]:
Let's go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

19
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:36,138
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

20
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:37,906
It's been pretty
nerve‐wracking huh?

21
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:40,943
Trust me, nobody knows
that more than me.

22
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:42,444
What do you mean?

23
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,880
Up until last year's tournament,
I didn't get to play

24
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,515
in many official games.

25
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:48,416
You know, because the third‐year
players had all the seniority

26
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:50,819
and everything... And now
when I have the seniority,

27
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,356
Kageyama actually has more
court experience than I do.

28
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:58,260
And yet he still lets himself
get all worked up... So weird.

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,730
Well... looks like it's
already his turn to serve.

30
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,199
[Kei]:
You think he'll be
able to hold his own?

31
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:05,433
[Daichi]:
Alright, Kageyama!

32
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:07,536
[Ryunosuke]:
You got this, bro!

33
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:11,473
Kageyama looks
happy, doesn't he?

34
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:12,575
Sure does.

35
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,843
Well, hopefully
that'll be good for us.

36
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,344
[Tadashi]:
What do you mean?

37
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:18,246
[Koshi]:
I've just been thinking...

38
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:20,883
every player seems to have
the same sort of pride

39
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:23,451
when it comes to
being put in a game.

40
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:27,255
Great players like him
and average joes too.

41
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:30,325
Kageyama! Don't
stress, okay?

42
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:35,230
Oh... Nevermind...
He's fine.

43
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,338
We just need one point!

44
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:45,007
Yeah!

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,248
[Hajime]:
Watari!

46
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,085
[Shimada]:
A service ace!

47
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:58,821
[Takinoue]:
The libero
messed it up!

48
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,589
Now they're tied!

49
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:01,890
Gotcha!

50
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,225
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:05,661
It's okay,
just keep trying!

52
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:07,395
Up high!

53
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,997
Hm?

54
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:11,266
Up HIGH!

55
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:14,469
He wants a high 10!

56
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:16,839
We did it!

57
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:19,608
Wait, that's not
the Kageyama I know.

58
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,076
Nope.

59
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:28,717
[Hajime]:
Someone cover!

60
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:30,753
They're scattered!

61
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,687
[Akira]:
It's coming back!

62
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:34,222
It's a chance ball!

63
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:36,892
"Bring"?

64
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:37,793
Or "give"?

65
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:39,427
Which one?

66
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,130
He didn't say anything!

67
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,733
Man, I still can't
believe how crazy

68
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,434
Karasuno's quick‐attack is!

69
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:49,738
There we go!
Finally turned it around!

70
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:52,040
Sugawara's nice...

71
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,743
He always compliments me
when I do good things!

72
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,279
[Tobio]:
Hey, Hinata.

73
00:04:58,413 --> 00:04:59,715
Proud... of you...

74
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,684
Thank you...?

75
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:04,219
Alright, Hinata's really
in his element now!

76
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,856
And Kageyama looks just like
a fish in water out there.

77
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:11,694
Well his name DOES
mean flying fish...

78
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:12,795
Oh great.

79
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,997
Hey... let's all relax.

80
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:18,567
Don't panic and let yourselves
get thrown off like they did.

81
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,737
[Toru]:
Once we gain back a
point, we're golden.

82
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:23,672
Right!

83
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:27,242
Hey... you. Stop posing like
that... It pisses me off.

84
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:28,744
You're not helping!

85
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:33,315
[Hajime]:
Got it!

86
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:35,818
[Yutaro]:
Good one, Iwa!

87
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:42,558
Looks like Kageyama's
gotten his rhythm back...

88
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:45,193
No, there's more
to it than that.

89
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:47,062
I should have lined up a bit
closer to the sideline.

90
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:49,097
[Irihata]:
Before, his focus was
glued on our blockers...

91
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:52,568
but now he's paying a little
more attention to his teammates.

92
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,209
Don't hold back now, boys...

93
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:04,179
If we don't take
this set, we're screwed.

94
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,282
Turbo‐charge
that freak quick.

95
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:09,151
Have some o' this!

96
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:11,253
Nice receive!

97
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:13,455
Kageyama told Hinata

98
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:16,324
that he's only the greatest
whenever he's around.

99
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:21,964
[Koshi]:
But...

100
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:23,732
it goes both ways.

101
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:29,137
Thanks to that combo attack...

102
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:30,739
they're BOTH the greatest!

103
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,709
Sweet! Our guys made it
to 20 points first!

104
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:36,645
[Shimada]:
This is the final stretch.

105
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:43,251
Alright, that's
20 points.

106
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:44,620
And now...

107
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,690
the real challenge
is about to begin.

108
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,259
Hey, since when
is this all about

109
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,428
Tsukishima versus Kageyama?!

110
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:54,462
[Daichi]:
C'mon, Hinata!

111
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:55,764
[Ryunosuke]:
Here goes!

112
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,401
[Hanamaki]:
Look out!

113
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,836
Chance ball!
Nice, Matsu!

114
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,437
Kageyama!

115
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:09,011
Any thoughts Asahi?

116
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:10,813
A little higher maybe?

117
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:12,648
Sure!

118
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:16,652
[Takinoue]:
Oh. Seijoh's finally
calling time out.

119
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:23,158
You know, whenever
number 10 goes back

120
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:24,693
and number 11
goes up front,

121
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:27,195
Karasuno doesn't do as
many center attacks.

122
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:29,665
True... Though that might
just be because Kageyama

123
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:32,234
doesn't like the tall
angry fella.

124
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:35,704
They weren't communicating
during yesterday's game,

125
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,640
and today isn't
any better...

126
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,908
I think of all Karasuno's
spikers, the beanpole

127
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:43,546
is the one Kageyama finds the
most difficult to connect with.

128
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:46,682
Please remind me to never
become friends with you, Oikawa.

129
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:47,816
Why is that?!

130
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,752
You point out
people's weaknesses.

131
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:52,955
Oh gimme a break I'm just
trying to strategize here!

132
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,423
[Chikara]:
I think he talks to all the
spikers so he can get a feel

133
00:07:55,524 --> 00:07:57,760
for their emotional state
during the game...

134
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,564
Helps him decide how to set.
Because everyone's different.

135
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,568
What?

136
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,804
I can't read
this guy at all.

137
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:11,907
All I know is that looking
at him pisses me off!

138
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,308
[Koshi]:
Kageyama.

139
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,277
Just start with
a conversation...

140
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:17,212
Try to be
more direct.

141
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,815
You need to communicate
with him okay.

142
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,785
Okay.

143
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:29,424
[Daichi]:
Got it!

144
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:34,630
[Hajime]:
Nice receive!

145
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,732
They got it...
Watch that counter!

146
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:40,302
Tsukishima seems to be having
trouble hitting the ball now.

147
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,606
They just
caught up!

148
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:45,207
Ah crap,
man, we're tied!

149
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:46,274
It's break time.

150
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:47,843
I know I need one!

151
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:49,077
Takeda!

152
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:50,345
Right!

153
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,217
[Black‐haired Guy]:
So uh... do they need
more attack power or what?

154
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:56,819
Karasuno's in kind
of a tight spot

155
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,487
now that their number 10's
not up front.

156
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:03,058
Hey, what's with you guys?!
You need to relax!

157
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:07,229
Look! You're all doing fine!
So just chill out!

158
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:08,997
[Ryunosuke]:
Okay...!

159
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:10,365
[Tobio]:
Hey.

160
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:15,604
Was that last set decent
enough for you, punk?

161
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:18,173
Why do you sound like
Tanaka all of a sudden?

162
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:19,875
What was that, punk?!

163
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,979
I hate your sets because
it's like you're forcing people

164
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,115
to play it your way
instead of their own.

165
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:28,851
Again with this, Tsukishima?

166
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:32,521
Come on, this isn't the time to
be bickering like little kids!

167
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:34,089
What are you saying?

168
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,227
I like to do things my way...

169
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,129
So please be consistent.

170
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,232
Um... what's wrong?

171
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:48,637
I think... whenever Kageyama
sets an A‐Quick for Tsukishima,

172
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:51,373
he's also signaling
its hitting course.

173
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:55,243
[Keishin]:
A position near the
setter means cross‐court.

174
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:57,813
And away is
turn‐swing.

175
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,982
Obviously, Kageyama
places the ball

176
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,417
wherever he thinks the
spike should be going.

177
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,653
But Tsukishima probably
has a hard time

178
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:06,889
hitting anything
like that.

179
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:09,825
You're not the only one out
there thinking, you know.

180
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:12,360
[Kei]:
Whether it's about
defense formation

181
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,962
or deciding what
attacks to use,

182
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:16,932
everyone on the team
is always thinking.

183
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:20,002
Hinata was able to figure out
how to do those quick attacks.

184
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,838
So even that poor dummy is
out there using his brain...

185
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:24,807
Well maybe not
that much.

186
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,876
Did you say "not much"?!
I think all the time, jerk!

187
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:28,811
Now, now...

188
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,579
That's fair.

189
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,849
Wait, what did you
just say? Are you sick?

190
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:37,753
Let's try it your way...
Maybe it'll work out for us.

191
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,326
Tsukishima must not
be used to dealing

192
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:48,496
with that kind of directness.
He doesn't know how to take it.

193
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,203
[Ryunosuke]:
Good job, Noya!

194
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:59,274
I like to do things my way...

195
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:01,476
So please be consistent.

196
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:08,851
Dammit!

197
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:12,988
Y'see that?! He hit the empty
zone right behind the block!

198
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:17,826
[Hisashi]:
That was kickass!
I'm actually kinda jealous!

199
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:20,462
I thought he was going to spike
it at the last second.

200
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:21,864
He's almost got
a glow about him

201
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:24,466
when he gets past
the blockers, huh?

202
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,101
A glow?

203
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:29,004
Uh‐huh, that's how Tsukki looks
when he's really into the game.

204
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:33,475
Chance ball!

205
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,012
Another trick!

206
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,481
[Hajime]:
That was close!

207
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:40,716
[Daichi]:
Heads up! Chance ball!

208
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,317
That Number 11's
got game.

209
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,086
I guess so...

210
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:45,588
but it looks like he's just
trying to avoid confrontation

211
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:47,455
with Seijoh's
high‐block.

212
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:50,125
You're right, Karasuno
keeps creating diversions.

213
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:53,862
[Black‐haired Guy]:
Yeah well... He can't run
from those blockers forever.

214
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah!

215
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:01,704
[Toru]:
Nice, Matsu!

216
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,574
Dammit... they already
took it back.

217
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,676
[Hajime]:
Center, 11!

218
00:12:09,477 --> 00:12:11,780
Again? I'll
get it this time!

219
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:15,183
[Hajime]:
Nice receive, Watari!

220
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:16,218
[Toru]:
I've got it!

221
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:16,785
[Yutaro]:
Center!

222
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,190
[Daichi]:
Good work, Tanaka!

223
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,659
Ah, dammit

224
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,093
They better be
careful right here.

225
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:27,495
This play will
make or break it.

226
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,632
[Shimada]:
It's up to the ace.

227
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:35,671
[Kei]:
Everyone on the team
is always thinking.

228
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,007
Number 11 again!

229
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:42,611
No, wait! Don't move!
Stay where you are!

230
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,349
Yeah!

231
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:48,851
AWW YEAH!

232
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,720
Tsukishima, you
magnificent bastard!

233
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,589
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice one!
[Kei]:
Get out of my face.

234
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,090
We were anticipating
a fakeout,

235
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,795
so our defense was too far
forward... They got us.

236
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:03,632
Uh.. gugu...
gugu... good job...

237
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,935
Don't hurt
yourself, Kageyama.

238
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:11,807
Wow... He actually
complimented Tsukishima.

239
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:14,677
Kageyama is changing,
no doubt about it.

240
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:18,146
What are you,
emotionally constipated?!

241
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,349
[Spectator 1]:
Set point for Karasuno!

242
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:22,618
[Spectator 2]:
This is crazy.

243
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,152
One more point!

244
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:25,320
You can do it!

245
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:31,426
Not gonna happen!

246
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:34,930
I‐wai‐zu‐mi! I‐wai‐zu‐mi!
Geeet thaaaat POINT!

247
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,701
[Takeda]:
It's alright! Look... the
last point is no different

248
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:41,770
than all the others you've
scored; you can win!

249
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,402
[Chairman]:
Well done!

250
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:19,141
[Hajime]:
Our last tournament.
The end of middle school.

251
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:21,176
Hey, you have a
genuine smile for once.

252
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:24,547
What? My smiles are always
honest and delightful!

253
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,382
If you have to SAY they are,
that means they're probably not.

254
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:29,952
I've never gotten
one of these before...

255
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:33,288
so why wouldn't
I be happy, huh?

256
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:36,859
[Hajime]:
Toru Oikawa laughs everything
off... but there was a time

257
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,961
when he couldn't do that.

258
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,398
He had a sturdy build.

259
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:45,834
Plus he was smart and swift.

260
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:48,070
And he just kept getting
better and better,

261
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,973
especially after middle school.

262
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:55,811
But still, there was always a
brick wall standing in his way.

263
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:59,815
Shiratorizawa, now known
as the best in the prefecture,

264
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:03,418
had just brought in Ushiwaka,
their new heavy.

265
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:07,756
Why can't
I beat them?!

266
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:13,195
[Hajime]:
They cleaned the floor with us.
We didn't even win a set.

267
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:16,932
We wanted to keep climbing
and reach new heights...

268
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:20,836
but we kept getting defeated
until our third year...

269
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,404
And then...

270
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,307
I'm Tobio Kageyama from
Akiyama Elementary School...

271
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:29,277
I've played this game
for years... Nice to meet you.

272
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:33,181
A genius swooped in
to take our place.

273
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:36,418
There was no mistaking
his overwhelming talent.

274
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:39,888
Kageyama always
looked so overjoyed

275
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:42,124
just to be playing volleyball.

276
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,727
His fire and his
technical expertise put him

277
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:46,762
miles ahead of the rest of us.

278
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,165
[Kita‐ichi Supervisor]:
He can play just about any
position we need him to,

279
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,735
but he'll eventually
be a setter.

280
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,903
[Kita‐ichi Coach]:
Yeah.

281
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:58,974
[Hajime]:
After that, Oikawa started to
push himself harder than ever.

282
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:02,911
You're working
way too hard!

283
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:05,814
Didn't the coach just
say that yesterday?

284
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,385
[Hajime]:
You'll be useless
to us if you get hurt!

285
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:13,021
Come on, it's time
to call it a day!

286
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,924
He was completely
losing his cool.

287
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:18,961
During a practice game, his
constant combo mistakes

288
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,864
made it clear he was
lacking composure.

289
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,266
Which led to...

290
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:28,704
[Kita‐ichi Coach]:
Kageyama, you're in!

291
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:29,772
[Tobio]:
Sir!

292
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,306
[Referee]:
Okay. Go in.

293
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:34,442
Forward!

294
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:35,778
Got it!

295
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:38,280
[Kita‐ichi #22]:
Nice cover!

296
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,815
[Hajime]:
Nice kill!

297
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,449
[Kita‐ichi #22]:
Serve's up!

298
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,328
[Tobio]:
Oikawa?

299
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:57,065
Can you maybe teach
me how to serve?

300
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:07,342
[Toru]:
Get away from me...
Go away...

301
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:12,380
Just go away!
Don't come any closer!

302
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:19,988
Get a hold of yourself,
you dumbass!

303
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:24,426
Sorry...

304
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:27,029
[Hajime]:
Kageyama. We're all
done for today.

305
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,131
[Tobio]:
O‐Okay.

306
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:41,076
[Hajime]:
We swapped you out today because
you needed to cool your head.

307
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:43,546
Give yourself a
little credit, alright?!

308
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,382
I can't do that!

309
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:50,285
Not if I'm not good enough to
bring down Shiratorizawa!

310
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:53,288
If I want to win and go to
Nationals, I need to work

311
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:54,890
as hard as I can!

312
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:58,894
All you ever say
is "me, me, me"!

313
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:03,198
What, do you think you're
the only person on this team?!

314
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:05,200
You listen to me, dumbass!

315
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,135
You'd better stop acting like
YOUR performance is the only

316
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:10,539
thing that matters or I'll
headbutt you IN THE FACE!

317
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:12,074
You already did!

318
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,777
I'm sure none of us has what
it takes to defeat Ushiwaka

319
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:17,279
one‐on‐one... But still...

320
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:21,383
That's why there's 6 people
on a volleyball court!

321
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:25,053
Who cares about that amazing
first‐year... or Ushiwaka?!

322
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:28,591
At the end of the day, the best
team of 6 wins, dumbass!

323
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,762
The best group
of 6 wins, huh?

324
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,232
(chuckles)

325
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:41,303
Whoa... Sorry, I must
have hit you too hard.

326
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,940
I can't even describe
how I feel right now.

327
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,643
It's like I'm invincible.

328
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:51,313
[Toru]:
Hey Iwa, is "dumbass"
the only insult you know?

329
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:54,149
[Hajime]:
You want another headbutt
to the face?

330
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:59,154
[Toru]:
Perfect! One more point!

331
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:03,225
[Kita‐ichi Coach]:
How about that? Oikawa seems
to be over his funk now.

332
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,160
[Kita‐ichi Supervisor]:
Good.

333
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,663
Hey, Oikawa... could you
teach me how to serve‐toss?

334
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,798
Yeah right, in
your dreams, dummy!

335
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,736
Stop picking on
the first‐year, Oikawa.

336
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,904
[Hajime]:
In our last middle
school tournament...

337
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:20,242
we won the first set against
Shiratorizawa Middle School.

338
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:24,980
We ended up winning
2nd place to them.

339
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,083
Oikawa got the
best setter award.

340
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:33,622
[Toru]:
Second place... That means our
spikers gave it their very best.

341
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:37,526
[Hajime]:
Yeah, but it also means
Ushiwaka's even better.

342
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,027
Damn it...

343
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:41,597
I'll beat him...

344
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:43,932
I swear I will!

345
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:46,669
I'll humiliate
that whole team!

346
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,771
Yeah, same here!

347
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,873
And you too dummy!

348
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,876
I don't know what high school
you'll be at in a few years...

349
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:57,012
but I swear, as soon as I get a
chance, I'm kicking your ass,

350
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,380
you hear me?!

351
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,749
Don't talk all big
with a runny nose.

352
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:01,984
You need a tissue?

353
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:04,252
Shut up!

354
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:06,054
[Seijoh Cheer Leader]:
Let's go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

355
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:07,690
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

356
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,291
[Daichi]:
Let's go!
[Hajime]:
Serve!

357
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:10,826
[Hanamaki]:
Heads up!

358
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:12,595
Uh‐oh, time for
Oikawa's serve.

359
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:17,666
You're up against the guy
who's second on your shit‐list.

360
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:22,470
So make it count, alright?

361
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,307
Oh, I plan to.

362
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:30,145
[Crowd]:
OooooooolÃ©

363
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:33,481
YOURS!

364
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:37,219
There it goes!

365
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,188
[Takinoue]:
Crap, it's heading
right back to Seijoh!

366
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:42,190
If he'd messed
up that serve,

367
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,093
it would've cost them the
whole set! This guy's good!

368
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,196
It's a chance ball!

369
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:52,000
[Kei]:
It came right back
to the setter.

370
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,435
The quick attacks
from the center

371
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:56,038
give them a higher
success rate.

372
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,109
[Tobio]:
I knew it; that's
exactly what I would do!

373
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:03,512
Oikawa's back's
against the wall,

374
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:06,214
so I'm guessing
his next move is...

375
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:08,416
...send it to Iwa!

376
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,698
Yeah!

377
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:23,832
No way!

378
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:25,634
Karasuno just
took back the set!

379
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,870
Dammit, I'll kill
that little shit!

380
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,605
Chill out.

381
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,974
Hey, what's so funny, jerk?!
You wanna fight or somethin'?!

382
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:34,843
Violence doesn't
look good on you, Iwa.

383
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:38,814
[Hajime]:
Relax. I only threaten YOU,
and you know I won't hit you.

384
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,250
You know...

385
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,987
that last quick from the center
was one of our best attacks.

386
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:46,188
Yeah?

387
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:48,524
Yet Kageyama was
able to stop it.

388
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:51,393
[Toru]:
He predicted I
would send it left.

389
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:53,729
Do you know what
that means?

390
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:56,364
He wasn't behaving
robotically like usual...

391
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:59,602
No, he noticed our
weak spot near the end...

392
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:02,971
not to mention our
unbreakable bond of trust.

393
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,740
We don't have that
and you know it.

394
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,544
[Toru]:
My point is, he just made
a solid judgment call.

395
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:15,684
That other setter...
What did he teach our Tobio?

396
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:18,120
That little self‐serving
dictator is on his way

397
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,956
to becoming a REAL leader.

398
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:26,261
What is this feeling? I'm
incredibly irritated, and yet...

399
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:33,602
Set 3! It's time to start!

400
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:35,403
Let's do this.

401
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,498
[Hajime]:
Time for the final set!

402
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:13,201
[Toru]:
I'm fired up!
This isn't like me at all.

403
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:14,637
[Hajime]:
Yeah, I'll say.

404
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:16,438
[Toru]:
What about my icy‐cool image?

405
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,507
[Hajime]:
Forget about your damn image!

406
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:21,844
Next Haikyu!!
"The Play to Change The Flow."

1
00:00:02,943 --> 00:00:06,547
[Tobio]:
When I started middle school,
I met a great athlete.

2
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:11,218
Seeing him play made
me think middle school

3
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:14,354
must be the big leagues.

4
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:17,190
But it wasn't middle school
that was impressive.

5
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:20,127
No, it was HIM.

6
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:23,430
If I can surpass him...

7
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:26,800
I'll be the best setter
in the prefecture!

8
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:39,412
(crowd cheering)

9
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:41,615
[Spectator 1]:
Wow, check out
Karasuno's setter.

10
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,351
Most first‐years can't
stand up to Oikawa can they?

11
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:47,921
Yeah, it's like Clash
of the Superstar Setters.

12
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:49,122
That was sweet!

13
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:50,524
You're just as good
as the Great King!

14
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:52,425
Pow! Pow! Pow!
POW! Pow! Pow!

15
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:56,396
I swear... Even if I face
someone who's better overall...

16
00:00:56,496 --> 00:00:59,232
I'm still the
best setter.

17
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:01,835
Doesn't matter,
you're up to serve now.

18
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:03,270
You'll be in the back...

19
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,573
so you can't do
it again, right?

20
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:07,575
Setter dumps are
illegal from there.

21
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:08,842
I KNOW!

22
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:11,545
I'll do it when I'm up
front again, alright?!

23
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:49,877
[Daichi]:
Serve it up, Kageyama!

24
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:56,784
Dammit!

25
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,385
That's out.

26
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:02,489
He put some real
strength behind that.

27
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,458
Somebody sign him up
for the baseball team.

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,928
[Daichi]:
Let it go!

29
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:09,830
I'm sorry!

30
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,834
(fangirls squealing)
Well then. Shall I show you
boys how it's done?

31
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:21,308
[Crowd]:
Oooooooolé

32
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:23,310
[Koshi]:
He hit it right to him!

33
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:26,980
Straight on... Nope, curve.

34
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,819
He just controlled
an Oikawa serve!

35
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,187
[Black‐haired Guy]:
That libero's incredible!

36
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:36,590
Aw... that's no fair!

37
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,059
How about that?
He's got some skill.

38
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,495
How did he retrieve that?!
It's like it was nothing to him!

39
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,064
I know, right?

40
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:45,132
Bring it!

41
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:46,934
[Hajime]:
Number 10!

42
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:52,540
Yeah!

43
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,742
Did you see that?
Over on the right?

44
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:57,945
Uh‐huh. Reminds me
of how Nekoma's setter

45
00:03:58,045 --> 00:04:00,213
[Takinoue]:
could throw people off
with a look.

46
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:03,684
Those magical sets of his
should be illegal... Am I right?

47
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:07,087
I'm kinda surprised Nishinoya
could save that one... Wait..

48
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:09,890
Unless you think maybe Oikawa
sent the ball that way

49
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,759
by accident; could that
be what happened?

50
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:15,829
Nah... He meant it
to be for Nishinoya.

51
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:18,265
[Keishin]:
If he HADN'T been
able to save that one,

52
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:21,835
it would have done some serious
damage to our team's morale.

53
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:25,272
I think that's probably
what he was going for.

54
00:04:25,372 --> 00:04:30,410
That was close... You really
saved our asses, Nishinoya.

55
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:31,612
Hey uh I'm sorry...

56
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:33,881
It's just...
they keep confusing me.

57
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:37,484
Well, Karasuno did a number
on Date Tech, after all...

58
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:39,687
Just give it a few
minutes or so.

59
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:42,289
It's not going to be
much longer now.

60
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,025
Anyway, I pity you.

61
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,727
You were Kageyama's partner...

62
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:50,798
Now he's gone and replaced you.
And with that little neophyte.

63
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:51,999
No, it's okay‐

64
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:53,534
You bet it is...

65
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:57,204
So what if Kageyama saw you
as... "just a subpar servant"?

66
00:04:57,304 --> 00:04:58,772
That was back
in middle school!

67
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:00,508
[Toru]:
So what if we don't
have a legendary

68
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,142
quick attack
like theirs?

69
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:05,679
Let's show him he never should
have driven you away, Kindaichi.

70
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:08,949
You're clear to jump.

71
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,284
Um.. yes sir!

72
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:12,653
[Koshi]:
Alright, Tanaka!

73
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:14,187
[Tadashi]:
Do your best!

74
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:15,589
[Hajime]:
Watari!

75
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:16,557
Okay!
[Hanamaki]:
Nice receive!

76
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:17,991
Center Ball!

77
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:19,492
An A‐Quick!

78
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:28,769
[Crowd]:
Kin‐Dai‐Chi! Kin‐Dai‐Chi!
Geeeeet thaaaaat POINT!

79
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:31,004
[Crowd]:
Kin‐Dai‐Chi! Kin‐Dai‐Chi!
Geeeeet thaaaaat POINT!
Am I crazy?

80
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:33,240
Because I think their number 12
is jumping higher

81
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,410
[Daichi]:
than he did in the
practice game. I mean, right?

82
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,647
[Toru]:
Your serve, Iwa!

83
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:42,950
[Daichi]:
Sorry, cover!

84
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,984
I got it!

85
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:45,753
Give it here!

86
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,531
A‐ha.

87
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,002
I need a
time‐out, sir.

88
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:07,908
Wait why is Seijoh calling
a time out? This is weird.

89
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:11,712
Yeah, didn't seem like Karasuno
was about to take the momentum.

90
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:15,148
[Toru]:
Okay... pay attention
to his choice of words.

91
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:17,651
"Bring it.. and "Give me."

92
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:20,453
Are you serious?
Did they already figure it out?

93
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,523
How'd they crack
it so fast?

94
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:25,893
[Toru]:
My first thought was, "Wow, that
little guy screams something

95
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,695
every time he goes in
to hit a set."

96
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:30,731
I just assumed
he was an idiot.

97
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:33,767
But then I noticed,
when they do that insane quick,

98
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,769
he'll say "bring it here"
or "bring it"

99
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:37,705
something with
the word "bring".

100
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:39,206
And for a
normal quick...

101
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:41,274
[Yutaro]:
He says "give it here" instead.

102
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:42,743
[Toru]:
Yes.

103
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:46,246
However... he is
their greatest decoy.

104
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:47,948
And this is
his strength...

105
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:50,183
They want us
to lock onto him...

106
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:53,521
So we're going to employ
a strategy to counter that.

107
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,689
[Toru]:
Whenever the shorty
says "bring it",

108
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,625
we'll put
one mark on him...

109
00:06:57,725 --> 00:06:59,092
If he says "give me",

110
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,862
we'll wait to see where
the ball goes before we jump.

111
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:02,663
Okay?

112
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:04,264
[Team Seijoh]:
Sir!

113
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:06,934
One thing though... We called
a time‐out pretty early

114
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:09,402
in the game for seemingly
no reason at all...

115
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:11,605
Won't they realize
we're onto them?

116
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:12,940
So let them realize it!

117
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,808
That can only benefit
us in the end...

118
00:07:14,908 --> 00:07:17,878
If those Karasuno clowns
think we've got their number...

119
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:21,982
[Toru]:
it's sure to make their poor
setter lose his mind.

120
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:25,352
Hey! That dumbfounded look
doesn't suit you, dude.

121
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:26,987
Nah, that's where
you're wrong...

122
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:29,289
I see this fool make this face
at school all the time.

123
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,058
[Ryunosuke]:
Mostly when he can't
make a decision

124
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:33,927
on what to get from
the vending machine.

125
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:36,329
[Tobio]:
I‐I don't do that!

126
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:40,033
Anyway, Noya... I can't
believe you hit that serve!

127
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,503
Well, I had to deal with it
back in middle school.

128
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:44,171
So I'm used
to it.

129
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:46,740
It was a killer serve whenever
it actually went through...

130
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,742
[Yu]:
but the success rate
was pretty low,

131
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,811
and it wasn't as controlled.

132
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:53,947
He must have really
been working on it.

133
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,584
It takes quite a lot to
stay in the top 4...

134
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,218
more than just great setters...

135
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:01,989
or only one player with some
above‐average serving technique.

136
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:04,858
Don't let 'em off easy...
Give 'em hell!

137
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,159
Yeah!

138
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:08,896
D'oh!

139
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,463
[Tobio]:
Did you just say "d'oh"?!

140
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:12,700
It happens; just
keep your head up!

141
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,968
Excellent, guys,
let's set the trap...

142
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:18,038
I assume you know where you
should be aiming, Kindaichi.

143
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:18,672
Yeah!

144
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:20,007
One point!

145
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:22,510
[Toru]:
Behind any strong setup...

146
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,078
is a solid initial receive.

147
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:28,315
[Hajime]:
Kindaichi's serve!

148
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,052
That's bizarre...

149
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:34,121
It didn't seem to be a
particularly powerful serve

150
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,689
that time, did it?

151
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,597
These are tricky.

152
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:44,965
[Keishin]:
Wait a second...

153
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:47,200
are they shooting for
when the setter moves up

154
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,669
from the back row?

155
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,904
That guy's not as good
at serving as Oikawa,

156
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:52,673
so why's the other team
having such a hard time

157
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:54,274
hitting the ball?

158
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:57,745
Ahem! Yeah, well,
here's the thing, ladies.

159
00:08:57,845 --> 00:09:00,013
[Takinoue]:
When the setter
is in the back row,

160
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:03,150
he can't get as close to the net
as the people in the front row

161
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,018
until the serve goes up.

162
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:07,755
That's why he has
to move very quickly

163
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,557
to get to the
net side position

164
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:12,492
the second the other team
puts the ball in the air.

165
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,762
There's a tiny delay
in the receive

166
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:16,363
as the players intersect,

167
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:19,132
which makes it easy
for mistakes to happen.

168
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:22,603
But as long as everyone knows
where the serve is headed...

169
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:25,172
...they can still
get it done.

170
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:26,674
[Tobio]:
Nice receive!

171
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,710
[Team Karasuno]:
Yeah!

172
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,546
Who knew this game
could be so complicated?

173
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:34,014
Thanks, random
old guy!

174
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:36,083
Wait what?!
Aw man...

175
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:37,150
Heh.

176
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,654
[Takeda]:
Oikawa's in
the front row now.

177
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:42,656
Watch number 3!
We'll have to look out
for that setter dump.

178
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,057
C'mon!
Just serve!

179
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:47,427
[Tobio]:
Damn, this is a
lot of pressure.

180
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:49,196
There's already
a 4‐point gap.

181
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,765
Like the coach was saying,
these guys know what's in

182
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:55,703
our bag of tricks.
We need to switch things up!

183
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:00,073
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice receive!

184
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:02,375
Setter dump!

185
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:07,648
You shouldn't rush a
setter dump, you know...

186
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,150
It's too easy
to shut down.

187
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:15,122
HAAAAAAA... BAM!

188
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:17,357
YEAH!

189
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:18,826
Woooo!

190
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:21,529
Just 4 more points
to turn this around!

191
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:22,462
Yeah, yeah!

192
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,865
You are so positive!

193
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:28,135
And it's really kinda
getting on my nerves.

194
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:32,806
Give it here!

195
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:35,976
We'll wait to see where
the ball goes before we jump.

196
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:38,445
[Yutaro]:
That's it!

197
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:42,583
[Daichi]:
Yes!

198
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,152
They figured it out...

199
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,654
[Ryunosuke]:
Kageyama's serve!

200
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:47,888
[Yu]:
You got this!

201
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:50,223
[Tobio]:
This time, I won't miss!

202
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,328
It's too far forward!

203
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:01,168
Good.. He adjusted
for a softer serve!

204
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:03,303
Damn!

205
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:06,173
You don't honestly think
I'll let you get away with that?

206
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:10,778
Kageyama made the first touch!
Now he can't make the set!

207
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,145
Here!

208
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,147
No way!

209
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:16,984
He turned a tight spot
into an opportunity...

210
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:19,252
The kid sure is
cool under pressure.

211
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:22,322
[Keishin]:
He's not thinking like
the other guys.

212
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:23,691
[Koshi]:
It's okay, guys!

213
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,726
[Tadashi]:
Yeah, keep it u... uh‐oh.

214
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:28,962
The next serve...
is Oikawa.

215
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,864
[Toru]:
Nothing shakes a
team's confidence more

216
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:34,001
than when their big talker
suddenly goes quiet.

217
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:38,572
[Crowd]:
Oooooooolé
[Toru]:
Watch and see!

218
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:41,875
[Crowd]:
Oooooooolé

219
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:05,999
[Team Seijoh]:
(cheering)

220
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:08,168
Shake it off!
Get the next one!

221
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:10,904
[Toru]:
The best way to build
pressure is ruining several

222
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:13,106
serve‐receives in a row.

223
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:16,910
First step is silencing
that loud skinhead.

224
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,579
Then the ace.

225
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,348
Breaking the two left players
who are crucial to the attack...

226
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:24,484
will nullify
the decoy's efforts.

227
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:29,523
That was quick! Why is Karasuno
already calling a time out?

228
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,159
They probably did it because
Seijoh has all the momentum...

229
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,994
And if they can't
fix that soon,

230
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:35,829
they'll never
be able to catch up.

231
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,866
[Spectator 1]:
They keep going after that
same guy. Sucks to be him.

232
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,434
Look... Send the ball
to the setter...

233
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:45,138
And if you can't do that...
then at least keep it up high.

234
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:46,173
Yessir!

235
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:49,009
And you,
Mr. Serious Pants.

236
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:50,711
Yeah that
setter dump...

237
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,012
What the hell
were you thinkin'?

238
00:12:52,112 --> 00:12:55,716
I'm sorry...
I snapped.

239
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,718
Okay, as long
as you know...

240
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,753
But it's more
than that, though.

241
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:01,955
[Keishin]:
It's good to
show our opponents

242
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:05,593
that we have a variety
of offensive techniques.

243
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:09,162
But once they're onto you, it's
easy for them to stop a dump.

244
00:13:09,262 --> 00:13:12,700
You have to be extremely careful
about how you time those.

245
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,134
[Tobio]:
Sir!

246
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:16,737
Listen, do not forget who
the opponent is here...

247
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,640
It's Aoba‐Johsai,
not just Oikawa.

248
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,844
[Keishin]:
And you're not the only one
fighting them. It's all of us.

249
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:25,445
Yes, sir.

250
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:27,748
Oikawa!

251
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,316
Let's go!

252
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:36,023
[Crowd]:
Oooooooolé

253
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,658
There it goes!

254
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:47,968
You're doing fine! Just keep
the ball in the air, Tanaka!

255
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:49,302
Uh‐huh.

256
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:53,406
[Yu]:
Tanaka!

257
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:55,543
Hey, cover!

258
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:57,410
[Hajime]:
Number 5!

259
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:58,478
Tanaka!

260
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:02,282
Time!

261
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:03,517
Right!

262
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,519
It's kinda early to use up
both of our time outs,

263
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:06,687
don't you think?

264
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:07,955
Then again, we've gotta
do something

265
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,890
to get the momentum
on our side.

266
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,560
Yeah, that's the thing
about volleyball...

267
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,162
Everything hinges on
keeping the ball in play.

268
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:19,700
[Shimada]:
Nothing's worse than the guilt
from repeatedly screwing up.

269
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,868
[Takinoue]:
Yeah...

270
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:21,935
And then they add
insult to injury

271
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,804
by going after
him like that.

272
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,607
Number 5 is having
a rough day.

273
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:29,577
Maybe I should say
something to him?

274
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:33,146
After all, Tanaka's always
got an encouraging word for me

275
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:36,049
whenever I start
to doubt myself...

276
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,752
Yeah, I will. Hey‐

277
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:42,556
[Ryunosuke]:
I'M SO STUPID!

278
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:50,097
I'm sorry!

279
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:52,499
Tanaka! Some things you
just can't help, okay?

280
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,168
That last set was ridiculous,
AND they triple‐blocked you!

281
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:56,704
I should've
followed through‐

282
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:59,306
Shut it! I didn't
call for the ball!

283
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:02,209
I just... I lost my focus!

284
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:05,378
And I'll be kicking myself like
hell when the game is over!

285
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,515
I'm not gonna drag
you guys down!

286
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,449
And I won't have you
wasting your time...

287
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,952
crying over MY
stupid mistakes!

288
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:13,887
[Ryunosuke]:
I'll... do better.

289
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,889
Ha! The fact that
you can say that

290
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:17,558
is good enough
for me, buddy!

291
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:18,959
Uh.. thanks.

292
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,294
Make sure to use both
your arms AND your feet,

293
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:23,096
or it'll bounce
right off you.

294
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:26,667
You could stand to be more like
Tanaka; you know that, Asahi?

295
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:28,468
I'm doing my
best here, okay?!

296
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:31,471
Huh... this is the second
time I've noticed it.

297
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:33,907
[Brown‐haired Guy]:
Oikawa is looking
really off.

298
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:36,577
[Black‐haired Guy]:
Yeah, well I heard it's his
little ritual to keep himself

299
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,145
from breaking
concentration.

300
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:39,747
A lot of teams
call time‐outs

301
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:41,682
just to throw off their
opponent's groove.

302
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:43,651
We'll see
if it works.

303
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:47,955
Bring it on!

304
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:50,423
[Yutaro]:
It's all you,
Oikawa!
[Hanamaki]:

305
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:53,961
[Keishin]:
Man, he's really got
his head in the game...

306
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:56,730
It's up to you guys
to take control now.

307
00:15:57,798 --> 00:16:02,302
[Crowd]:
Ooooooooolé!

308
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:05,706
[Ryunosuke]:
If it hits the
ground, we're dead!

309
00:16:05,806 --> 00:16:06,774
[Asahi]:
Tanaka!

310
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:09,743
Crap!

311
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,478
Don't let it fall!

312
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:17,250
That's what
I'm talking about!

313
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,952
And in the best
possible spot.

314
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:20,053
Here!

315
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:21,655
Get it, Hanamaki!

316
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:25,626
Nice receive!

317
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:26,860
Someone cover!

318
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,462
LEFT, NOW!

319
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:30,564
Tanaka!

320
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,801
Tanaka makes his
share of mistakes.

321
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:37,137
And he takes the bait every time
someone pushes his buttons...

322
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:38,872
but...

323
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:42,309
[Keishin]:
His power's second
only to Asahi's...

324
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,645
and he's got the mental
fortitude to keep trucking

325
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:48,716
and play his best, even when
he's near his breaking point.

326
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,719
No doubt about it...

327
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,724
...he could be an ace.

328
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:00,027
Whoa!

329
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:01,829
Looks like the bald kid's
got it goin' on, now!

330
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:04,031
He pulled the rug right
out from under 'em.

331
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:05,699
YEAAAAAAAH!

332
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,735
YEAAAAAAAH!
[Spectator 1]:
Not bad!

333
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:11,438
Well, that's alright; I suppose
I can let go of a point or two.

334
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:15,375
Whoo, that was the best look
at a block I ever had!

335
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:18,178
I just mean... sometimes I can
see the other team's block

336
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:20,781
in midair, clear as day,
like it's in slo‐mo.

337
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:25,318
[Ryunosuke]:
With a bright ray of light
shining through it.

338
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,487
That sounds
so cool!

339
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,322
You'll see one day!

340
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:30,691
It's your
serve, jackass!

341
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:31,925
Right!

342
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:34,494
Their flow's been broken.

343
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,930
[Tobio]:
And there's still time...

344
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:39,567
We can come back!

345
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:45,172
[Daichi]:
Nice one‐touch!
Chance ball, baby! Woo!

346
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,274
Bring it here!

347
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,344
Gotcha!

348
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:53,947
He's too fast even
when we expect him!

349
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:57,551
Look, you... Please don't
tell me you STILL can't beat

350
00:17:57,651 --> 00:17:58,485
that kid's sets.

351
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:00,788
Kageyama's? Of course
I can't...

352
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:04,157
You really think I can do
a pinpoint set like that?

353
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,893
Please don't
be mad!

354
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:08,562
[Toru]:
I may not have as much talent,
but I'm more in tune

355
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:12,399
with my teammates' capabilities
than he'll ever be.

356
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:15,669
So, I'm just as good
a setter as he is.

357
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,275
It got past
the block again.

358
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,477
Aw, don't look so shocked,
little guy.

359
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:25,946
Striking right above
the blockers

360
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:28,916
is what Kindaichi
does best, after all.

361
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,585
[Daichi]:
Forward!

362
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:34,922
[Tobio]:
7 points. That's way
too big a gap!

363
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:35,856
[Shoyo]:
Bring it!

364
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:40,127
Wow, they're really bringing
their A‐game today, aren't they?

365
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:41,829
I'm impressed!

366
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:46,834
We do NOT need to deal with
a double‐block right now.

367
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:50,070
If we're not careful, they'll
take back the momentum...

368
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,440
I have to shake
one of those blockers.

369
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,512
During my second year of
high school, I heard about

370
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:02,082
a middle schooler who was
a legend in his own time.

371
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,584
[Toru]:
"The King of the Court?"

372
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,087
I thought. "He must be
wonderful at what he does."

373
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:11,458
But when I saw him play, I knew
the name meant something else.

374
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,195
He's got power, and talent, and
he craves victory more intensely

375
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:16,897
than anyone I know.

376
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:21,134
All those qualities make up
Tobio Kageyama's strengths...

377
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:23,003
But...

378
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:26,139
they're also his weaknesses.

379
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:28,909
No man is an island,
little Tobio...

380
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:32,445
You may have been at this
for two months now, but...

381
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,449
It takes longer than that
to break a bad habit.

382
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,318
Nice kill, Hanamaki!

383
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:39,553
Yeah! Way to go!

384
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:40,754
Woo!

385
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:42,189
Hey, Hinata!

386
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:45,125
It's time to change it up...
Do you remember the signals?

387
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,660
Remember?

388
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,161
You mean we're gonna use the
signals that we talked about?!

389
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:49,396
[Daichi]:
Cover!

390
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:51,632
[Hajime]:
Now that's a block!

391
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,134
Ah! It's mine!

392
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,736
[Daichi]:
One more time!

393
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:58,338
Y'know... I've been watching
Karasuno's attacks...

394
00:19:58,438 --> 00:20:00,608
I think they're
gradually speeding up.

395
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,177
I don't like how
fast this is going.

396
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:06,479
We don't have any
time‐outs left.

397
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,650
Slow it down, fellas!
Stay cool out there!

398
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,752
That's not very
wise of them...

399
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:14,387
They're so desperate
to outrun our blockers...

400
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:16,557
they're valuing speed
above all else.

401
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:19,893
But they're losing
their accuracy.

402
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:23,697
[Irihata]:
Whether they realize it or not,
as their speed increases...

403
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:26,700
the number of mistakes
will increase as well.

404
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,504
You really are
something, Tobio Kageyama.

405
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,773
[Toru]:
No one but you could
pull off that combo move

406
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:37,645
with the short kid...
But it's not all about him.

407
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:39,780
Don't you think your Number 3
would have what he needs

408
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,349
to overcome our blockers
if you would only set to him

409
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,918
a little slower
from now on?

410
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:48,255
Wouldn't it help if Four‐Eyes
actually trusted your sets

411
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:50,390
when he hit them?

412
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,460
Every spiker has his
own unique quirks.

413
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,495
The player who can take
those quirks and use them

414
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:57,831
to their
potential is...

415
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:00,668
...a true setter.

416
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:08,509
[Tobio]:
This is bad!
The gap isn't shrinking!

417
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,477
I'll do whatever
it takes to fix this!

418
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:13,146
[Daichi]:
Over the net!
Push it back!

419
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,904
You know, Kageyama doesn't seem
like himself anymore does he?

420
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:44,712
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice receive!

421
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:47,648
[Tobio]:
I won't lose this game!
I refuse to!

422
00:21:47,748 --> 00:21:50,751
I have to win
and stay on the court!

423
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:57,057
[Yu]:
Nice follow thru!
Get ready!

424
00:21:57,157 --> 00:21:58,826
Chance ball!

425
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:02,062
Oikawa's got horse sense, and
he puts in a decent effort...

426
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:06,033
But compared to a wiz‐kid like
Kageyama who's two years younger

427
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:07,835
than he is...

428
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:11,905
[Irihata]:
He's got skill, but he's
far from a genius.

429
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:14,307
Still, with the way
things are currently,

430
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:18,411
I can confidently say that the
more proficient setter...

431
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:19,980
...is Oikawa.

432
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:09,957
[Takinoue]:
A swap? Right now?

433
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,792
[Shimada]:
Man, that's
brutal...

434
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:13,460
It's hard to
keep your head up

435
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:15,228
when you have to leave
the court like that.

436
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,899
[Takinoue]:
How would you know, Shimada?
You're a a benchwarmer.

437
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,703
[Shimada]:
Next Haikyu!!
"The Talented Upperclassman."

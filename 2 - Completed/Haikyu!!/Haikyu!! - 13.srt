1
00:00:03,163 --> 00:00:04,798
One more time!

2
00:00:04,898 --> 00:00:07,701
As soon as he hits
the peak of his jump...

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:10,437
the ball needs
to meet his palm!

4
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:14,908
Now I just take aim...
and swing!

5
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,339
[Shoyo]:
(grunts)

6
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,008
Damn. I sent it
a little too high!

7
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:56,409
(growls)

8
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,811
Thanks, Captain!

9
00:01:58,712 --> 00:02:00,480
Nice job
covering Daichi!

10
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:02,315
[Yaku]:
It's in!
[Yamamoto]:
Front!

11
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:04,384
Nice one Inuoka!

12
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:05,853
Over here!
Here you go!

13
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:09,523
Ready to block, Hinata?
One, two, three...

14
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:11,058
Gotcha!

15
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:14,628
[Inuoka]:
Smooth cover, Kai!

16
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:15,996
Wow... Both of these teams
have got some pretty

17
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:17,931
diligent worker bees,
don't they?

18
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:21,134
They're not flashy, but they
make themselves indispensable.

19
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:23,804
In the end, they can
make or break a game.

20
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:27,641
Kenma! One more
over here!

21
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,577
I don't care who says
our offense is no better

22
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:32,680
than average...
I'm the ace of Nekoma!

23
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,483
That's our point!

24
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:38,018
Dammit!

25
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:40,988
Look at that! Yamamoto's
especially enthusiastic today!

26
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:43,023
I wonder if he's fired up
because there's a player

27
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:45,458
on their side who
reminds him of himself.

28
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:47,728
[Nekomata]:
Or maybe he's inspired
by that vicious rivalry

29
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:50,964
between Inuoka and
that Number 10?

30
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:53,601
What's wrong with
Hinata and Kageyama?

31
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,736
Their attacks
aren't lining up.

32
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:58,138
Because they're doing those
crazy combo attacks where

33
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:00,974
Kageyama synchronizes with
Hinata's movements...

34
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:02,610
but now they're
trying to excecute

35
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,812
normal quick
attacks instead.

36
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:08,081
Look, you have to stop
tensing up like that, alright?
[Keishin]:
Hinata needs to work

37
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:10,117
It's slowing down
all your timing.
Right.
And the only

38
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:12,986
is conditioning
through repetition.

39
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,188
But if he gets the training
and he learns when to use

40
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:17,858
both kinds of attacks,
then eventually...

41
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,895
They won't be a demon
and his iron club anymore.

42
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:25,098
[Nekomata]:
They'll be a demon and a demon!

43
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,901
[Yamamoto]:
Serve's up!

44
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:33,907
Aw, crap! Should I hit
it over or underhanded?

45
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:34,608
Ugh!

46
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,110
Noya, cover!

47
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,213
Aw yeah! The ace might
come through in a pinch...

48
00:03:40,313 --> 00:03:43,216
but he's not the only
one! Leave it to me!

49
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,885
Hyaaaaa! Gah!

50
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:45,819
Whoa!

51
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,588
They never
stood a chance!

52
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:52,392
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, YEAHHHH!

53
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:59,032
I'm not gonna get shut down
either! I can do this!

54
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,868
[Daichi]:
Hinata...

55
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:03,336
Kageyama said not
to tense up, remember?

56
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:05,172
Keep your
eyes open.

57
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:06,139
Y‐Yes, sir!

58
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,274
(whistle)

59
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:09,877
[Yaku]:
Fukunaga!

60
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,782
The buzzcut guy's moving
this way! A quick attack!

61
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:17,017
Keep your
eyes open.

62
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:20,854
[Shoyo]:
What's number 7 doing?

63
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:26,259
Nice one‐touch!

64
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,828
A chance ball!

65
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:29,429
Huh?

66
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,698
He's quick!

67
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:33,767
[Koshi]:
Nekoma's number 7's fast, too!

68
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,736
It's amazing to me
how two opponents

69
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:38,171
can influence each
other in moments like this.

70
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,508
[Nekomata]:
Each one continually
pushes the other

71
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:42,275
to new levels of power.

72
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,078
That makes them
"worthy adversaries".

73
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:48,415
He made
it through!

74
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:49,249
He did it!

75
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:50,551
Oh, heck yeah!

76
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:53,386
Grr... That was
still too high.

77
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:56,957
One more!
One more!

78
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:01,128
Haaaaaaa!

79
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:03,964
YEAH!

80
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:05,566
(growls)

81
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,537
[Koshi]:
Uh‐oh... If we're not careful,
they might beat us to 20.

82
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:11,204
It's your serve, Inuoka!

83
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:12,372
Okay!

84
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:19,146
So when Lanky McSpikehead
goes to the back row,

85
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:22,015
then Rooster Top
comes to the front...

86
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,852
I liked playing
with Lanky, but...

87
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:26,920
This guy's
kinda scary.

88
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,256
Inuoka's about 8 inches
taller than you are

89
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:31,659
and you still gave him
a run for his money...

90
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,293
Not too bad, Small Fry.

91
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:34,562
Ack!

92
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:37,230
[Shoyo]:
Who you callin'
Small Fry, Small Fry?!

93
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:38,732
[Tobio]:
C'mere.

94
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:40,901
Ah! Hey, lemme go!

95
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:43,203
We are going to do
the usual move, now.

96
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:46,206
What? You mean the
super hard‐hitting one?

97
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,307
That's right.

98
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:50,043
Aw... Can't we stick
with the soft one?

99
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:51,812
I was just starting
to get used to it...

100
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:56,183
[Tobio]:
Forget it. We can't do that
with him on the front row.

101
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:57,417
Why can't we?

102
00:05:57,518 --> 00:06:01,288
Because I said, alright?!
It's a hunch.

103
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:02,990
[Yaku]:
Put it over!

104
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:07,961
[Team Karasuno]:
(Cheering)

105
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:11,799
Hah!
Awesome!... I never get
tired of that feeling!

106
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:14,267
That was a smart
choice just now.

107
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:17,571
Hey, that's
my bad, guys...
[Keishin]:
With that third‐year middle

108
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:20,207
Hey, don't worry
about it, man!
special quick attack
is more effective.

109
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:24,144
If they'd gone with a normal
quick attack, a skilled player

110
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:26,279
like that would've shut
it down without batting an eye.

111
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:28,816
Okay, I'm the next one
to serve!
[Keishin]:
If you looked up

112
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,684
Make sure it stays
in bounds this time.
I bet you anything you'd
see that kid's picture.

113
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:32,653
Y‐You don't have
to tell me that!

114
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:36,056
But that's alright.
We can catch up.

115
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,926
[Ryunosuke]:
Go for it, Hinata!

116
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,896
[Yamamoto]:
Nice receive!

117
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:45,666
Oh wow look at that...
Everyone's all jumbled up!

118
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:47,501
Who's it
gonna be?

119
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,503
They should leave it to their
most powerful attacker Number 4!

120
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:51,271
Haaaaaa!

121
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:53,707
A back
row attack!

122
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:55,375
The front three were a decoy!

123
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:58,045
They just shook off
all our blockers!

124
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,882
That's a
chance ball!

125
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,284
Who's gonna get it?

126
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:07,655
An A‐Quick!

127
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:09,089
Wow...
[Team Nekoma]:
Yeah!

128
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:10,558
That was pretty
quick, alright.

129
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:11,859
Would you look at that?

130
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,427
That attack has got
first‐rate stability.

131
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:18,966
[Yamamoto]:
Sweet, it's my
serve this time!
[Keishin]:

132
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,634
[Yaku]:
Make it a good one!

133
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:22,836
Hah!

134
00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:24,638
Ah jeez.. Cover!

135
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:25,739
I'm open!

136
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,974
Asahi!

137
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:32,546
Who's gonna
attack next?!

138
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:34,247
Another A‐Quick?!

139
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:36,950
He's not jumping!

140
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,821
[Team Nekoma]:
(cheers)
Grr...

141
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:42,856
What kind of
move was that?

142
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:45,025
That's called a delayed spike...

143
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,394
You pretend that you're
gonna jump for a quick.

144
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:49,897
[Keinshin]:
It throws off
the blocker's timing.

145
00:07:49,997 --> 00:07:51,965
That kind of attack has
been out of popularity

146
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:55,168
for a long time though...
I gotta admit I'm impressed

147
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:58,371
they thought to throw that one
in right after their A‐Quick.

148
00:07:58,471 --> 00:07:59,439
Excellent!

149
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,908
[Keinshin]:
Not bad.

150
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:03,343
[Takinoue]:
Nekoma made it to 20 points.

151
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:06,379
They're just 5 points
away from taking it.

152
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,648
Son of a...

153
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:10,518
I've already used up both our
timeouts and everything.

154
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:13,420
(smug laugh)

155
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:16,056
(smug chuckle)
Is that sneaky
bastard laughing at me?!

156
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:20,227
[Takeda]:
It's crazy. Ever since their
number 1 rotated to the front

157
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,796
it would appear the proficiency
of all their attacks

158
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:24,331
has been
through the roof.

159
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:26,867
[Keishin]:
That's true...
But look at it this way;

160
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:29,036
with half of our lineup
being first‐years,

161
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:31,138
you might consider us
a level 1 team...

162
00:08:31,238 --> 00:08:34,307
Let's give 'em hell, Yamamoto!
By that standard, Nekoma's a
good 10 or 20 levels higher.

163
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:36,143
[Yamamoto]:
Yeah!
[Takeda]:
In other words...

164
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,512
[Takeda]:
they're a full‐grown
adult feline,

165
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:41,181
and we're a baby birdie
fresh out of the nest.

166
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:43,483
[Keishin]:
Exactly.
Good metaphor.

167
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:47,655
They've got a perfect balance
of offense and defense...

168
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:50,057
There's no way
we can compete.

169
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:55,228
Least not today. So...
Guess that means...

170
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:57,130
[Keishin]:
All we can do is persist!

171
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,067
Hit 'em with our full power
and don't let up!

172
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,536
So you want us to beat 'em
into submission, boss?!

173
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,438
Wow, that really makes us
sound like the bad guys.

174
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:06,774
Wahahaha!

175
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:08,709
What's so bad about
being the bad guys?!

176
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,344
We'll be just like the crows
perched on the gates to Hell.

177
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:13,814
Could you please stop that,
Coach, you're freaking me out!

178
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:16,049
Our attacks and receives
may be sloppy...

179
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:18,051
but we're gonna
make this happen!

180
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:20,053
Thes're the weapons
we've got right now,

181
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:21,755
so use 'em
the best you can!

182
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:24,324
[Keishin]:
Hit 'em with all the
artillery we've got!

183
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:28,295
Hit 'em! Hit 'em...
Hit 'em hard!

184
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,399
Grr!

185
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:35,102
That was great!
Nice block, Tsukishima!

186
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,004
Keep it up, Tsukki!

187
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:38,138
[Yamamoto]:
It's okay, Inuoka.

188
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:40,007
[Inuoka]:
Sorry...

189
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:42,109
Karasuno catchin' up
to 'em, now.

190
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,410
Yeah, it's pretty close;

191
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,412
the mood of the game
has changed entirely.

192
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:47,648
(whistle)

193
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,551
Anybody gettin'
scared, yet?

194
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:52,052
Nope!

195
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:55,388
Good to hear it...
You just keep that ball in play.

196
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:56,557
[Team Nekoma]:
Yes, sir!

197
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:57,691
(whistle)

198
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,163
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

199
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:05,766
Okay! Just one
more point to tie!

200
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:08,035
Okay you guys
keep it up!

201
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:09,937
Can't let 'em
score any more.

202
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:11,304
Right!

203
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,376
[Team Nekoma]:
(cheering)
[Takeda]:
Oh no!

204
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:20,648
This wasn't supposed to happen!
They've got match point!

205
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:21,915
[Kuroo]:
One more point!

206
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:23,784
[Yamamoto]:
Yeah!
Dammit...

207
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:26,219
[Keishin]:
look at 'em, they
haven't even flinched!

208
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:28,455
I guess we're not much
of a threat to them are we?

209
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:31,191
[Takeda]:
It's alright!

210
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,128
[Takeda]:
We're still sharp.
We can do this.

211
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:58,185
Aw yeah! We clawed
our way up to a tie!

212
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:01,388
Don't get too
excited, pal!

213
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:07,761
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

214
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,062
Grr...

215
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:10,463
Things might get a
little trickier now that

216
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:12,800
their Number 3's
in the front row.

217
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,904
Our crucial middle blockers are
working at a hundred percent.

218
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:19,306
Come on guys,
get ready!
[Keishin]:
Hinata's got the

219
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:21,842
to score points around
their blocker...

220
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:26,814
and Asahi's our top player
when it comes to offense.

221
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:28,816
With the two of them
in the front row...

222
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,885
this is the perfect chance
to turn this game around!

223
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:34,822
If we can get a point right now,
then it's a deuce.

224
00:11:34,922 --> 00:11:36,389
You're right...

225
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:37,991
Then they'd have to score
another point, giving us time

226
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:39,226
to turn the tables!

227
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:41,562
[Takeda]:
It all depends
on this ball!

228
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:43,430
Nice receive!

229
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:47,601
Hinata's quick attacks are
still shaky. What do I do...?

230
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:50,604
Come on!

231
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,542
Aw, I thought
we had it for sure!

232
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:55,475
Hold on...

233
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:57,144
Here it comes!
It's a chance ball!

234
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:58,946
Agh! My bad,
you guys!

235
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:01,014
Direct spike, Asahi!

236
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:02,415
No way!

237
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:04,718
Do it, Asahi!

238
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:06,219
Yah!

239
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:08,556
They got
it again!

240
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:11,024
Oh no! It's Karasuno's
chance ball again!

241
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,826
That's how it goes.

242
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:13,761
Huh?

243
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:15,295
You can make mistakes...

244
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:17,397
in fact, you can fail
to make an attack at all...

245
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:21,334
[Nekomata]:
but as long as that ball doesn't
hit the floor, you can't lose.

246
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,270
It's a chance ball!

247
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:27,575
Hinata's so
amped right now...

248
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:30,611
it's just like when
I first met him.

249
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:34,247
[Tobio]:
He's intense,
larger‐than‐life...

250
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:36,183
There's nothing
he wants more

251
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:38,686
than the ball out
in front of him.

252
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,655
Well, here it comes!

253
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:50,664
That was it!

254
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,303
The truth is, it's
not that whoever has

255
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:58,506
the best abilities, wins.

256
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:09,817
It's that whoever lets the ball
fall down on their side, loses.

257
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:19,993
(final whistle)
[Nekomata]:
And that... is what it means
to keep the ball in play.

258
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,898
[Team Nekoma]:
We win!

259
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,441
We didn't make any mistakes
the whole time...

260
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:38,245
and we hit them with
the best weapons we have.

261
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:40,914
But still...
we couldn't beat 'em.

262
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:44,718
Nice one, big guy!
That's our setter for ya!
[Keishin]:
Those Nekoma kids have

263
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:48,656
instead of as individuals.
They deserve this win.

264
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,793
[Shoyo]:
One more time!

265
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:53,794
(shocked gasps)

266
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:55,162
Another game!

267
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:56,096
Huh?

268
00:13:56,196 --> 00:13:57,998
[Shoyo]:
Please!

269
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,200
Sure! I was
planning on it.

270
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,803
It wouldn't be a practice game
if it wasn't followed

271
00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:04,805
by a rematch
or two.

272
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:07,741
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice one!

273
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:09,076
[Kuroo]:
Let's go!

274
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:11,111
[Yu]:
One more!

275
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:12,813
(whistle)

276
00:14:12,913 --> 00:14:15,683
[Keishin]:
Alright, NOW we've been
thrashed without a doubt.

277
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:17,751
Yeah we should
probably call it a day.

278
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:20,220
[Takeda]:
Look how tired they are.

279
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,989
One more match!

280
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:24,825
Again?! You haven't stopped
moving since you got here;

281
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:27,160
where'd you get
all that energy?!

282
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,596
Give 'em a rest, ginger!

283
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:31,699
If they stay, they're
gonna miss the last train!

284
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,602
[Daichi/Kuroo]:
Circle up!

285
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:39,740
Actually... your Coach Ukai's
grandfather and I have been

286
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,276
You kids really have some
talent, don't you?
acquainted for a very long
time. We used to play practice

287
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:45,813
I thought we almost had you
for a second there...
games with Karasuno
every chance we got.

288
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:49,817
I gotta say... Nekomata's
trained you guys well.
It was always a pretty

289
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:51,585
But then...

290
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:53,887
Retiring?

291
00:14:53,987 --> 00:14:55,656
[Ukai]:
Yeah, I'm afraid
old age is starting

292
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:58,391
to catch up with me.
Sorry, my friend.

293
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,460
That's too bad...

294
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:03,664
But hey... either way, I'm sure
we won't be too hard up

295
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:06,466
for opponents
for practice games.

296
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,775
[Nekomata]:
The thing about rivals is...
a good one is hard to find.

297
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,045
Poor old Ukai... After he
retired, I heard that he

298
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:21,181
starting to have
some serious health problems...

299
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:25,919
and I was certain Karasuno would
never make a comeback from that.

300
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:29,089
[Nekomata]:
But you kids have got more
potential than I thought,

301
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:30,724
especially with your offense.

302
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:34,494
That Number 9 and Number 10
combo is something else.

303
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:37,665
That attack's gonna
be difficult to beat.

304
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:42,035
Those left players of yours
are a couple of powerhouses too.

305
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:45,105
It all comes down to how long
you keep the ball in play.

306
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,074
Right!

307
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:49,643
[Nekomata]:
You need a lot more practice
working together as a team,

308
00:15:49,743 --> 00:15:51,845
but you've all got
outstanding promise.

309
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:53,814
With the appropriate
training, you should be able

310
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:56,449
to improve by
leaps and bounds.

311
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,520
Seeing that really
does my old heart good.

312
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:03,724
[Nekomata]:
I'm glad to have a worthy rival.

313
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:07,027
We'll see you again
at the Nationals.

314
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:09,462
[Nekomata]:
In that shining,
sprawling gymnasium

315
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:11,865
packed with thousands
of cheering spectators...

316
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:14,935
amidst the whirl of
excitement and intensity.

317
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:17,470
The ultimate
trashcan showdown...

318
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:20,140
The real "cats versus
crows" faceoff!

319
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,909
Yes, sir!

320
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:24,978
[Keishin]:
Alright! Let's get
all this stuff put away!

321
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:25,879
Right!

322
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:27,047
You little turd!

323
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:28,415
Y‐yeah, YOU are!

324
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:30,651
[Daichi]:
Come on, let's pick up the pace!

325
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:32,853
[Yamamoto]:
Hey!

326
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:36,690
Yeah? What the hell
do you want, dirtbag?!

327
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,692
You lookin' to get
yourself dealt with?!

328
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:40,594
Come on at me,
city boy!

329
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:45,065
Actually... it's uh...
the thing is...

330
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:46,466
Huh?

331
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:49,570
Your... Your manager...
Could you maybe, like...

332
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,872
Could you tell me what
your manager's name is?

333
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:53,073
A‐choo.

334
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:55,743
Grrr.... You son of aaahh!

335
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:58,478
You stay away from her...
She is our manager!

336
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:00,147
If you even
LOOK at her...

337
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:02,950
I'll yank that ugly lint
brush right out of your skull!

338
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,020
Don't worry... I'm too much
of a coward to talk to her.

339
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,289
[Kuroo]:
Fukunaga, could you
mop over there?

340
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:10,691
[Fukunaga]:
Got it.

341
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,459
[Kuroo]:
Yaku, you mop, too.

342
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,161
[Yaku]:
Okay...

343
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,168
[Ryunosuke]:
Kiyoko.

344
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:23,771
Her name is Kiyoko Shimizu.

345
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:27,407
That's perfect!... Her name
means "clear spring water"!

346
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:29,577
Yeah, it really does
suit her, doesn't it?

347
00:17:29,677 --> 00:17:31,545
It took me a long time
to work up the guts, too,

348
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:35,148
so I know how you feel,
but...! Check this out...

349
00:17:35,248 --> 00:17:38,986
You want her to flat‐out
ignore you... It's awesome.

350
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:40,721
Hwaaaaaa!

351
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:43,356
No way, man! I don't think
I can handle that!

352
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:45,726
(hearty laugh)

353
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:48,762
You know something?...
You're not so bad, brother!

354
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:53,834
Huh? Yeah, same to you.
I'm uh... Taketora Yamamoto.

355
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,136
And I'm
Ryunosuke Tanaka.

356
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:58,672
Heh.
Heh.

357
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:01,675
How long have you been
playing volleyball?
Who taught you how to play?
How long have you been a setter?

358
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:04,211
Did you come up with
that feint yourself?
Have you been training?
Have you ever hit a brick wall?

359
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:05,746
If so, what did
you do about it?

360
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:08,716
He's growly and scary
like a saber‐tooth tiger!

361
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:10,217
That's who
he meant.

362
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:13,854
That was incredible, Shoyo!

363
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:18,091
"Swoosh!" "Vroom!" "Pow!"
Oh, I'm Inuoka, first‐year!

364
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:21,028
And you're really tall,
but you ran fast like "zoom!"

365
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:22,329
And then "kaboom!"

366
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:24,331
You were so cool when
you were like "blam!"

367
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:26,099
So were you!
It was like "sha‐ping!"

368
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:28,902
Thanks! And I'VE never seen
anybody "fwop!" like that!

369
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:31,138
It wasn't like "fwop!"
It was more like a DA‐DOOOM!

370
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:33,306
[Shoyo]:
Don't you think?
Do you... understand that?

371
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:36,143
[Kuroo]:
Nah, they sound like
a couple of toddlers.

372
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:39,547
But you know... maybe YOU should
try goofing off once in a while

373
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:40,981
instead of
acting all stoic.

374
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:43,651
That's not one
of my strong suits.

375
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,486
You sound like
an old man.

376
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:49,322
I‐I'm so sorry! I should
have been moving faster!

377
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:50,991
W‐wait, what are
you apologizing for?

378
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:53,160
This was all my fault;
please forgive me!

379
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,028
[Asahi]:
Just calm down...
Great, he's scaring
the first years...

380
00:18:55,128 --> 00:18:57,397
They can't see
what a softie he is.

381
00:18:57,497 --> 00:18:58,866
In a way, they uh...
Kinda look like

382
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:00,267
father and son
from here, huh?

383
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,970
More like a scared kid
and his kidnapper.

384
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:09,510
Um... why is your
libero staring at me?

385
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,911
Oh, sorry...

386
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:13,180
Maybe if you just try
to avert your eyes,

387
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,749
[Yu]:
Hey! I thought your
receives were really great!
he'll leave you alone‐

388
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:17,885
Our team's ace
is pretty strong...

389
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:19,553
And I've never
seen anybody actualy

390
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:21,254
retrieve spikes
from him before.

391
00:19:21,354 --> 00:19:23,323
Your team has killer receiving
skills And a lot of that is

392
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:26,059
[Yu]:
because you have so much
talent as a libero!

393
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:27,761
So well done!

394
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:30,497
But I won't lose next time!
Count on it!

395
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:33,701
Ah! Hey.. wait!
Let him respond!

396
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:36,670
Um... sorry, he's
kind of intense.

397
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,338
He's dangerous.

398
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:39,740
Huh?

399
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,174
[Yaku]:
He's got lots of skill
as a libero too,

400
00:19:41,274 --> 00:19:43,043
but he doesn't let
himself get any rest.

401
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:46,179
He just keeps going,
looking onward and upward.

402
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,315
So he's a threat.

403
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:53,987
[Takeda]:
Coach Nekomata!

404
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:56,624
Thank you for making such
a long trip to play with us.

405
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:58,458
Not at all,
it was my pleasure.

406
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,294
(chuckles)

407
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:03,997
[Nekomata]:
I'm sure it's hard to get
someone to play practice games

408
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:07,034
with when you don't
have connections.

409
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:09,903
You had my phone ringing off the
hook! And at one point you even

410
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:13,240
threatened to come
irritate me in person!

411
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:15,809
I‐I'm sorry!

412
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:18,979
Anyway... enthusiasm
breeds more enthusiasm.

413
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,314
You don't have much
experience, yet...

414
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:23,450
but if you keep your
nose to the grindstone,

415
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:24,852
and the kids'll
follow you.

416
00:20:24,952 --> 00:20:26,286
[Nekomata]:
Good work.

417
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:29,156
Thank you so much, sir!

418
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:31,458
(whimpering)

419
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,127
I want to see you get it
together, too, Keishin...

420
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:36,029
After all, we played
three games today

421
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:38,298
and you didn't take
a single set.

422
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:39,533
Then next time we play,

423
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:42,135
I'll kick your ass
in EVERY set, old man.

424
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:47,040
Ooooh?... Is that so? Well,
I think you're full of hot air.

425
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,142
[Naoi]:
P‐please don't
provoke him, Coach...

426
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:51,679
[Nekomata]:
It's his own fault he looks
just like his gramps!

427
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:54,281
[Naoi]:
That makes no sense!

428
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:55,816
[Takeda]:
Uh hang on!

429
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,685
I thought you said you'd
only stay on as coach

430
00:20:57,785 --> 00:20:58,952
for the Nekoma game‐

431
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:01,354
You expect me to take
that lying down?!

432
00:21:01,454 --> 00:21:05,192
I'll get revenge in a big venue
with a crowd watching!

433
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:11,398
We'll be reunited soon, comrade!

434
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:13,500
Okay... that's weird.

435
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,903
Yeah I know...
Just don't look.

436
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:18,305
(laughs)

437
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:19,673
(chuckles)

438
00:21:19,773 --> 00:21:20,941
You won't win
next time.

439
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,410
Oh really? Because
I think I will.

440
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:25,045
Cut it out;
you're being weird!

441
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:27,948
The next practice game
isn't gonna go down like that!

442
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:30,784
Good, otherwise it's not
much of a practice game, is it?!

443
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:31,785
Not them
too!

444
00:21:31,885 --> 00:21:33,721
Come on,
really?!

445
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:35,322
[Shoyo]:
Kenma!

446
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:37,190
Shoyo.

447
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,126
When I first met you
on the street...

448
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:42,395
you said you didn't really like
volleyball that much, right?

449
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:44,164
Oh... Yeah.

450
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:47,901
[Shoyo]:
How about now? Didn't it
feel good to win?

451
00:21:50,437 --> 00:21:53,874
[Kenma]:
Eh... it was the
same as always.

452
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:57,511
Next time...

453
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:03,250
I'll make you want to win really
bad... and then WE'LL win!

454
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,353
And then... You'll say "Man that
was a blast! I hate losing!"

455
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:09,389
And the way you talk about
the game'll change for good.

456
00:22:11,191 --> 00:22:15,228
Cool... Well...
I'll be waiting.

457
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:48,622
If that had been
a real match...

458
00:23:50,591 --> 00:23:52,125
We'd have been done...

459
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:55,863
as soon as we lost that
first game... That's it.

460
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:03,103
Yeah, I know.

461
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:05,205
It's good to know
you've thought about it.

462
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:06,473
Huh?

463
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:08,175
We DO have a real
game coming up...

464
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:11,579
The Inter‐High
Preliminaries, remember?

465
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,080
Now let's hurry
back home...

466
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,715
We need to do some
serious thinking

467
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:16,249
about today's
practice game.

468
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:18,752
Then we get
back to work!

469
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:20,487
Yes, sir!

470
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:25,425
[Koshi]:
By the way, Kageyama,
did you ask their setter

471
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:27,761
about that technique where
he feints with his eyes?

472
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:29,129
[Tobio]:
No.
[Koshi]:
Awww...

473
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:30,931
were you too shy to talk
to him or what?

474
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:33,567
[Tobio]:
What did you
say to me?!
[Koshi]:

475
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:37,004
[Tobio]:
Next Haikyu!!
"The Tough Opponents"!

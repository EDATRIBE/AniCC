1
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:10,488
[Shoyo]:
The final set.

2
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:13,758
Listen to me...
Please keep winning!

3
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:20,498
If we screw up now...

4
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:22,601
...we're done.

5
00:01:59,497 --> 00:02:01,365
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice receive!

6
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,735
Number ten!

7
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:07,305
[Hajime]:
I'm sure they've already
changed the signal

8
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:09,440
for the crazy quick attack.

9
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,310
Well, it's a simple signal...
So they can switch it out

10
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,778
pretty easily y'know.

11
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:16,648
But still... there must be
SOME sorta clue.

12
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:19,117
I guess if we see
him tracking the ball...

13
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:20,585
then it's a normal one.

14
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:23,487
But if he just dives right in...
then it's the quick.

15
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:27,025
True, we need to watch
Number 10 specifically.

16
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,059
[Yutaro]:
Good plan.

17
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,628
Number Ten is‐

18
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:31,495
At the end of the day he's
still just a decoy though...

19
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:34,098
Don't forget that...
alright guys?

20
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:35,199
[Yutaro]:
Right!

21
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:36,635
[Team Seijoh]:
Yeah!

22
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:42,541
[Yutaro]:
Not this time!

23
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:45,043
We keep messing
things up!

24
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,578
Still rallying.

25
00:02:46,678 --> 00:02:49,714
On average, they've got us beat
at defense and blocking.

26
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:53,151
[Daichi]:
A feint!

27
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:55,419
Argh... too close!
[Takinoue]:
Our libero does have some
outstanding skill though.

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,421
[Yu]:
Asahi!

29
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:02,026
[Spectator 1]:
The setter received it!

30
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:03,427
[Spectator 2]:
Now he can't make the set!

31
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,029
[Spectator 1]:
Their attack's gonna flop.

32
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:06,665
[Spectator 2]:
Watch 'em go left!

33
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,600
It's all yours!

34
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,168
Mine!

35
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:20,879
[Keishin]:
Looks like my hunch
was right after all.

36
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:25,249
I suspected Aoba‐Johsai's
libero started out as a setter.

37
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:28,119
[Takeda]:
Why do you say that?

38
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,754
[Keishin]:
Well, think about it.

39
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:32,957
If a libero crosses the
attack line to do an overhand

40
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:36,595
set and somebody spikes it,
then that's an illegal move.

41
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:39,798
So this guy jumped just behind
the attack line to redirect

42
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:44,168
the ball in midair...
Which makes it a valid spike.

43
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:47,405
He's got expertise
in both positions.

44
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:50,041
Aoba‐Johsai really knows
what they're doing!

45
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:54,646
[Crowd]:
Oooooooolé

46
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:55,947
Agh! Heads up!

47
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:57,015
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice receive, Cap'n!

48
00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:58,449
Asahi!

49
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:03,121
[Daichi]:
It's coming back!

50
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:04,623
Gotcha!

51
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:10,361
[Hajime]:
Take that!

52
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:18,336
[Tobio]:
That was so close to the edge.

53
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,941
Awesome...

54
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:27,979
You boys are doing
great work out there...

55
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,214
Let's keep it up now!
[Team Karasuno]:
Sir!

56
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:32,917
[Keishin]:
They're starting to catch on
to our center attacks,

57
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:35,386
so I want you to make sure
you're using the full width

58
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,556
of the court
every chance you get!

59
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:38,923
Right!

60
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:42,493
[Koshi]:
How can their offense be
so perfectly airtight?!

61
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:45,163
They turn every scenario
into an advantage,

62
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:47,532
as if it was
planned that way!

63
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:49,634
Let's do it guys!

64
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:51,035
Sir!

65
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,171
Putting in Sugawara for a
little bit really helped us

66
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,806
get back on our game.

67
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:58,042
It helped us lose a lot
of unnecessary tension.

68
00:04:58,142 --> 00:05:00,912
[Keishin]:
I think all of our guys
are playing at their

69
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:02,981
full potential, now.

70
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:04,683
But them...

71
00:05:04,783 --> 00:05:08,486
They've been in the zone for a
long time. This won't be easy.

72
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:14,959
Yeah, Tsukishima!

73
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:17,929
Get dirty and bite 'em in the
ass when they're not looking!

74
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:19,363
Um whoa.

75
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,733
I'm sure even with
everyone playing at 100%...

76
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:26,104
Seijoh is still the more
capable team... But...

77
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:28,640
Having your strength
drop to 70%...

78
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,776
and then quickly powering up
above a hundred and twenty...

79
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:34,813
[Takeda]:
That's what this
game's all about, right?

80
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,751
[Takeda]:
Besides, Karasuno has
exactly what we need

81
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:44,322
to give us that turbo boost...
We have our greatest decoy!

82
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:47,692
[Shoyo]:
This is so much fun!
And our opponent is so strong!

83
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,194
I want to play...
I want to play...

84
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:51,362
Now, now, now!

85
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:52,130
[Koshi]:
Hinata?

86
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,565
Yeah?

87
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:55,499
You do remember what
Coach Ukai told us, right?

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,603
To use the full width
of the court... I know.

89
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:02,306
Yes... And we have an attack
that's perfect for that.

90
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,843
[Koshi]:
But we've barely
used it in this game.

91
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:11,149
Yeah!

92
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:12,917
[Toru]:
I don't like this.

93
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:15,554
The rest of the team is
keeping it together, but...

94
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:18,222
I can't help it;
whenever that little guy

95
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:20,525
walks onto
the court...

96
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:24,563
It makes me nervous.

97
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,931
He's been sitting in the warm‐up
zone for a long time,

98
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:30,869
letting all his frustration
build up inside.

99
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:34,773
[Koshi]:
Wow, Karasuno's really pulled
it together in the final set...

100
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:37,576
but Seijoh always seems
to be one step ahead of us.

101
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:41,112
[Koshi]:
Those two... If there's any
chance of us catching up,

102
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:43,682
it's gonna depend on them.

103
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:47,886
Come on you guys, we need you
to get us that extra step ahead!

104
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,054
[Hanamaki]:
Left side!

105
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:51,489
[Hajime]:
Nice receive!

106
00:06:52,924 --> 00:06:55,293
[Ryunosuke]:
Smooth moves, Kageyama!

107
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:56,861
[Daichi]:
Chance ball!

108
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:59,864
[Shoyo]:
Remember to use the
full width of the court!

109
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,068
The little punk's
actually going to do it!

110
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,940
[Toru]:
A wide broad‐jump!

111
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:23,054
Nice kill, Hinata!

112
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:24,589
Dammit.

113
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,492
[Toru]:
The duo's back together.

114
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:31,730
I can't let those two
stay on the court!

115
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:36,735
Nice, Makki!

116
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:37,969
Yeah!

117
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:40,138
I wish the rotation
would move faster!

118
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:45,476
I need the shorty to move to
the back as soon as possible!

119
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:48,713
[Hanamaki]:
Got it!

120
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:52,951
Wow, the ball never hits
the floor... How cool.

121
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:54,819
Got it...!

122
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:56,621
Again?!

123
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,823
Use the whole court!

124
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:05,096
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

125
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:07,498
That little guy's awesome.

126
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,000
[Shimada]:
It's volleyball...

127
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,570
And this game's all
about nonstop jumping...

128
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,205
It's like you're
fighting against gravity.

129
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:15,940
[Shimada]:
Jump to decoy.

130
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,475
Jump to block.

131
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:19,077
Jump to spike.

132
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,546
[Daichi]:
Hey, nice cover!

133
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:23,682
[Shimada]:
The longer the rally goes...

134
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:25,950
Go to the back! One more time!
[Shimada]:
the more frantic and uneasy

135
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,719
Left side!
the players become.

136
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:29,554
Let's stop the
next one!
When you get tired,

137
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:31,523
it makes you slack off.

138
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:34,192
I remember in one match,
I even wished someone else

139
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,827
would spike for me.

140
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:38,462
Oh yeah, there was this one
rally that went on forever

141
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:40,565
and I was totally
worn out.

142
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:41,933
[Takinoue]:
It got to the point

143
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:44,068
I didn't even care where
the ball went anymore.

144
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:45,436
I just wanted it to fall.

145
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:48,106
Bring it to ME!

146
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:53,945
[Shoyo]:
If I slow down for even a
second, I'll never catch up!

147
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:57,115
And with my height, if I
let up on my jumping power,

148
00:08:57,215 --> 00:09:00,284
that big tall wall's gonna
shut me right out!

149
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:03,321
That's why I have
to keep running!

150
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:07,058
And keep jumping!
I want to stay in the court!

151
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:11,830
You won't hit
unmarked... No way!

152
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:17,135
[Tobio]:
Now! Take advantage of the
entire width of the court!

153
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:18,970
And then...

154
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:23,007
Break through the center!

155
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:24,175
Yeah!

156
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:28,613
Now that's a pipe!

157
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:30,348
That was a great kill!

158
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:32,551
Hinataaaaaaa!

159
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:33,885
Damn!

160
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:37,589
Sorry... I let
'em trick me.

161
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:41,760
[Tobio]:
I knew the timing was perfect
to pull off a pipe...

162
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,566
And yet... I almost handed
it to Hinata just now!

163
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,669
He nearly took the
toss away from me!

164
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:55,574
He IS the greatest decoy.

165
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:57,509
[Spectator 1]:
Karasuno caught up.

166
00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:59,310
[Spectator 2]:
They're tied.

167
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,344
I'll get
the towels.

168
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:02,080
Thank you.

169
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,114
Thanks.

170
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,223
The rallies are longer than
they were in the first two sets.

171
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:13,525
I'm sure it's tough.

172
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,859
Still...

173
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:19,798
...seems nice.

174
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,268
What's the plan?
That broad jump's no joke.

175
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:30,975
It's a simple move.

176
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:35,179
Just shut him down.

177
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:59,571
[Daichi]:
Yeah, nice kill!
[Ryunosuke]:
Boom!

178
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:02,574
Hinata's about to be
in the back row.

179
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:04,876
Hey! You're doing
okay, right?!

180
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,779
Uh... Yeah,
I'm good!

181
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,015
Score as much as you can
before you move back.

182
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:11,950
You got it!

183
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,417
[Matsukawa]:
Nice receive!

184
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:14,385
[Toru]:
Kindaichi!

185
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,487
[Asahi]:
Number 12!

186
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:18,823
[Daichi]:
Nice job, Nishinoya!

187
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:19,624
Now!

188
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:21,593
Whoa! Another
broad‐jump?

189
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:22,861
Is he...?

190
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:27,766
[Takinoue]:
He's unmarked! Th‐they're
not blocking anymore!

191
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:30,301
There ya go!
Hit it unmarked!

192
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:35,974
Bring it.

193
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:38,910
Nice try.

194
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:41,412
[Hajime]:
Nice, Watari!

195
00:11:41,513 --> 00:11:43,147
[Daichi]:
They planned that!

196
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,183
[Asahi]:
That was quick! They just
switched up their game

197
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:46,885
in no time at all!

198
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,692
A setter dump, really?!

199
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,493
[Keishin]:
They confused us
for a second...

200
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:58,830
just so they could
sneak that in!

201
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,899
Let's nip that
broad‐jump in the bud.

202
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:03,434
Yeah but how do
we do that, Coach?

203
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:06,971
Well, the shorty's broad‐jump
may be insanely fast...

204
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:09,273
But I suspect he has a tendency
to get caught up

205
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:10,975
in the momentum...

206
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:13,812
which limits the accuracy
of its placement, right?

207
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,115
Instead of blocking,

208
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:19,350
I say we counter their
broad‐jump using digs.

209
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,752
Right!

210
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,186
Good point, but if we
can't make the block work,

211
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:24,255
then it's only gonna get
in the way of our receive.

212
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,424
No matter how difficult
it gets out there,

213
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:29,528
don't ever stop thinking or get
out of tune with your teammates!

214
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:31,596
[Toru]:
Nice receive!

215
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:35,066
[Keishin]:
Shouldn't his broad‐jump be
enough to throw them off?

216
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,136
Just when we REALLY can't afford
for them to hit their groove...

217
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:40,505
[Keishin]:
HE'S up to serve again.

218
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,309
Just one point.

219
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:46,277
Yep!

220
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:48,980
[Crowd]:
Oooooooolé

221
00:12:51,015 --> 00:12:53,885
[Seijoh Fan]:
Inside the net!
That boy is lucky!

222
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:57,021
There was no stoppin' that!
Just keep goin'!

223
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:59,824
[Daichi]:
Damn, another
2‐point buffer.

224
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:00,792
Stay calm...

225
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:05,496
[Crowd]:
Oooooooolé

226
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:08,567
Cover!

227
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,635
Okay, right here!

228
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:11,903
[Daichi]:
Kageyama!

229
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:13,872
Last hit, Asahi!

230
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:15,607
That was close!

231
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:17,909
I can tell they're
really nervous!

232
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:25,449
Whoa... I bet that's
really stressful!

233
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,788
One way to gain the flow is to
control a long rally like this,

234
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:33,124
and this one's
high‐stakes.. Let's watch.

235
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:37,061
[Daichi]:
Cover it!

236
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:39,664
You won't get this point and you
will not control the flow!

237
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:41,199
[Shimada]:
It's still in play!

238
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:43,034
[Takinoue]:
Yeah, But who's gettin'
the last hit?!

239
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:45,069
Center!

240
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:47,572
Hinata! It's all you!

241
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:49,674
Hinataaaaaaaa!

242
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:51,943
Block him!

243
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:58,550
Yeah!

244
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:02,053
Uh‐oh...

245
00:14:02,153 --> 00:14:04,255
Now Karasuno's already used up
both of their time‐outs.

246
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,558
What choice
did they have?

247
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:09,293
[Shimada]:
If they hadn't called a time‐out
to physically cut off the flow,

248
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:11,630
Seijoh would've
run away with it!

249
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,066
[Keishin]:
There must be something we can
do to change the momentum here.

250
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,770
We don't need anything fancy,
I just want one good play.

251
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,440
Something that'll clear the air
and get us on the right track!

252
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:35,587
Whew, Seijoh touched the net!
That was a lucky break.

253
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:37,255
Yeah...

254
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:38,356
[Toru]:
Perfect.

255
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:41,192
The shorty's in
the back row now.

256
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:44,262
If we screw up..
They'll be over 20 points!

257
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:46,931
And if they take the momentum,
we'll never catch up!

258
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:48,767
Please make
Seijoh screw up!

259
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,235
Hey, man...
y'seein' this?

260
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:55,373
What the‐?!

261
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:58,442
[Shimada]:
Tadashi is their
pinch server?!

262
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:04,315
Has Keishin completely lost his
mind?! That's never gonna work!

263
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:06,551
The best that kid can
manage is a fluke!

264
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:09,487
Well, maybe a fluke
is what he's hoping for.

265
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,122
Huh?

266
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:12,957
[Takinoue]:
You never know,
something as simple as that

267
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:15,594
might be all you need
to shift the momentum.

268
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:18,496
That's their guy?

269
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:20,532
You guys think he's actually a
good server? Or did they just

270
00:15:20,632 --> 00:15:23,067
throw him in the game
to shake things up a little?

271
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:26,538
Either way, it's
not gonna fly.

272
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:31,976
I hope you do good... But not
as good as I can do!

273
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:34,278
He can't even stand
being out for a second.

274
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:37,448
[Keishin]:
Tadashi! Turn the
tide for us!

275
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:39,183
O‐Okay!

276
00:15:40,184 --> 00:15:42,854
[Tadashi]:
This is it.

277
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:45,957
Beyond this line
is a different world!

278
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:54,666
Wow, it's even a
different temperature!

279
00:15:58,102 --> 00:16:00,939
Hey, this is your time
to shine, Tadashi!

280
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,040
Yeah!

281
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,575
Just do your
best, Tadashi!

282
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:05,109
Yeah, good luck.

283
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,411
Uh, don't worry, just relax
and take it easy out there!

284
00:16:07,512 --> 00:16:09,914
[Daichi]:
You should take
your own advice, Asahi.

285
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:13,284
Jeez, being thrown in now
would make anybody panic!

286
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:16,755
His first high school game AND
his first serve, all at once?!

287
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:18,322
Is Coach some sorta sick‐o?!

288
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:20,391
Man, this is stressing ME out!

289
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:22,594
But I can't let
Tadashi see that...

290
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:25,229
At least he won't hit me
in the head like Hinata.

291
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:29,133
This seems kinda risky... I mean
things are already so tense...

292
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,902
I bet he's feeling
bad being put in

293
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,704
before the
upperclassmen.

294
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:34,939
Yeah, you're right.

295
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,242
[Koshi]:
Hey, Tadashi!

296
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:41,379
You're great! Good luck! Woo!

297
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,127
Oh, boy... This
isn't lookin' good.

298
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:57,729
I don't blame him.

299
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:00,164
[Shimada]:
In a team‐oriented game
like volleyball,

300
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:03,001
serving is the only time
you're ever truly alone.

301
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:07,138
All eyes are on you.
The pressure's unbelievable.

302
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:08,740
[Tadashi]:
I'm scared, but...

303
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:12,210
[Shimada]:
No matter who you are...

304
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,412
the moment you step
into that serve position,

305
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:17,215
you become the
star of the game!

306
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:23,321
[Tadashi]:
This is your chance to
prove yourself, Tadashi!

307
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:30,228
A jump float?!

308
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:33,665
Come on...!

309
00:17:46,144 --> 00:17:50,181
[Crowd]:
Go, go Seijoh! Go, go Seijoh!
Geeeet thaaaaat POINT!

310
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,651
Well then...
that's that.

311
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:54,018
I‐I'm sorry.

312
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:55,119
Hey It's alright.

313
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:56,688
Yeah.. don't
sweat it, bro.

314
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:57,789
You're good.

315
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:01,425
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:02,493
Nah.

317
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:04,295
There is no need
to apologize.

318
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:06,531
Let it go...
Move on.

319
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:08,767
[Daichi]:
Tadashi!

320
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,269
S‐Sorry, Daichi!

321
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:13,738
Next time...
You'll get it.

322
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:18,442
Next time...?

323
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:19,611
Right!

324
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:29,253
[Irihata]:
Karasuno's mood just shifted.

325
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:33,592
That's Daichi for ya...
Always knows just what to say.

326
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:37,328
Wow... For some reason I don't
feel stressed out at all now.

327
00:18:37,428 --> 00:18:38,997
Yeah, me neither.

328
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,432
Weird... They brought that
guy in and then kicked him

329
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:43,735
right back out as soon
as he messed up.

330
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,403
I kinda feel
sorry for him.

331
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:48,406
That's the point of using
a pinch server like that.

332
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:51,142
That point was huge because
it wasn't just the flow

333
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,912
but the whole team's pride
was riding on it.

334
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:55,780
And Tadashi
couldn't cut it.

335
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,749
One point!

336
00:18:57,849 --> 00:18:59,483
[Shimada]:
But this was a chance for him
to develop a frustration

337
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:01,219
with his own
powerlessness.

338
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,387
And that's enough to
make anyone stronger.

339
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:05,724
[Ryunosuke]:
Boom!

340
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:08,259
Get some!

341
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,428
The buzz cut guy's
pretty fired up now.

342
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:13,665
Oh yeah, I was
noticing that myself.

343
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:18,102
That's my point. The smallest
thing can turn the game around.

344
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:22,941
[Daichi]:
The prize for winning this
game is the chance to play...

345
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,208
...again!

346
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:27,345
Yeah! Let's keep
it goin', you guys!

347
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:29,347
It's like we're
chasing after Seijoh,

348
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:31,683
but they're just barely
out of reach.

349
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:36,320
[Shimada]:
Unless we can use the break to
score, we're dead men walking.

350
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,260
[Keishin]:
Their accuracy's dropping
with their energy.

351
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,862
[Toru]:
Kunimi!

352
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:46,898
That's advanced.

353
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:48,667
This is
dragging out...

354
00:19:51,903 --> 00:19:53,004
That was out...

355
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:54,506
[Ryunosuke]:
My bad!

356
00:19:54,606 --> 00:19:59,110
[Crowd]:
Seijoh! Seijoh!
Geeeeet thaaaat POINT!

357
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,244
Woo!

358
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:02,581
Come on...
Get that break!

359
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:08,787
[Tobio]:
Leave it!

360
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,288
[Daichi]:
Good eye!

361
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:14,593
Good, good!

362
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:17,361
Give us another one!
Back‐to‐back!

363
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:22,500
I cannot let it
hit the floor!

364
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:26,971
Did he seriously
use his foot?!

365
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:34,178
There we go!
Ow... Ooh.

366
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:36,681
Nice one, Red!
Wow! Ha‐HA!

367
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:41,285
[Shoyo]:
You're up, Kageyama!

368
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:43,287
One more...

369
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,492
Here you go!

370
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:51,329
Whoa, Daichi!

371
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:53,965
I'm not losing
this game!

372
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:55,433
I'm not losing
this game!

373
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:57,201
I'm not losin'
this game!

374
00:20:57,301 --> 00:20:59,538
[Daichi]:
I'm not losing.

375
00:21:01,873 --> 00:21:03,241
But...

376
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:05,276
Gotcha!

377
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:07,378
[Daichi]:
I'm sure they
feel the same way.

378
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:14,185
I cannot believe this...

379
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:16,955
[Takinoue]:
They got match point!

380
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:23,528
[Crowd]:
One more point! One more point!
One more point! One more point!

381
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:26,698
[Yu]:
Hey! Don't
wimp out now!

382
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:29,367
Let's give it
all we got!

383
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:38,743
Yeah!
Whoo! Now that's
a kill, Asahi!

384
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:40,478
One more!

385
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,280
[Daichi]:
Let 'er rip, Tanaka!

386
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,815
[Tobio]:
One point!
[Asahi]:
Give it to 'em!

387
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:46,751
If I flub this serve,
it's game over...

388
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:50,589
And if they receive and make a
strong attack, we're done for!

389
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:57,028
They're gonna quick attack!
Don't let it fall!

390
00:21:57,128 --> 00:21:58,530
[Ryunosuke]:
At least...

391
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:00,899
...touch it!

392
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:04,435
Oh, crap!

393
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:07,438
[Takinoue]:
It's going over! They're
gonna go for a direct!

394
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:16,915
[Toru]:
A one‐handed set?!

395
00:22:32,564 --> 00:22:36,768
[Crowd/Team Karasuno]:
(loud cheering)

396
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:10,729
[Yu]:
Wow, you two really are
going the extra mile!

397
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:12,096
[Shoyo/Tobio]:
Thanks!

398
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:13,497
[Shoyo]:
24‐24. That's deuce.

399
00:24:13,598 --> 00:24:14,933
[Tobio]:
First team to score
two points wins.

400
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,668
[Daichi]:
And that's gonna
be us, right?

401
00:24:16,768 --> 00:24:18,436
[Team Karasuno]:
Yeah!

402
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:21,806
[Shoyo]:
Next Haikyu!!
"Lonely King No More".

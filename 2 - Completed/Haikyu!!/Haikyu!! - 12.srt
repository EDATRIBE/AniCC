1
00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:10,239
[UKAI]
I'll be seeing you at
Nationals this year.

2
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,408
[NEKOMATA]
Hmph! Yeah, that's what
you say every year, Ukai.

3
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:16,145
[UKAI]
Oh be quiet! This is
going to be the one.

4
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:22,351
[GUY A]
This oughta be good! The
trashcan showdown, cats versus
crows! Can't wait to see it!

5
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:25,487
[TAKEDA]
But that June at the
Inter‐High preliminaries,

6
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:28,123
both schools narrowly missed
earning a ticket to Nationals.

7
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:34,029
[TAKEDA]
In March of the following year,
Karasuno High, representing
Miyagi prefecture,

8
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:38,267
and Nekoma High, acting
as Tokyo's second
representative school,

9
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:41,136
both appeared at the spring
high school national tournament.

10
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:46,141
[TAKEDA]
Karasuno was defeated in the
third game, and Nekoma made it
to the quarterfinals,

11
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:48,511
before they were also
eliminated.

12
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:52,582
After that, the two schools held
many, many practice games...

13
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:58,220
but both coaches eventually
retired without ever having
faced each other in an
official match.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,759
[TAKEDA]
These events led to the steady
decline of both teams over the
years to come.

15
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:14,236
[TAKEDA]
But now...

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,606
Gah!

17
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:21,443
[TAKEDA]
...their fated rematch
is about to start!

18
00:02:57,907 --> 00:02:58,874
[SHOYO]
Kenma!

19
00:02:58,974 --> 00:03:00,810
[KENMA]
Huh? Hey.

20
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,145
You're really on
the Nekoma team?!

21
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:04,614
[KENMA]
Uh‐huh.

22
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:07,282
How come you didn't tell
me that when we met?

23
00:03:07,382 --> 00:03:09,051
Well, you...
didn't ask.

24
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:12,688
[SHOYO]
(stunned) But when you left,
you said "later",

25
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:15,357
so you must've known I was
gonna be here, right?!

26
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:19,428
[KENMA]
Uh, you had "Karasuno
High School" written
on your t‐shirt, so...

27
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,396
[YAMAMOTO]
Well, well, well!

28
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:25,334
You know, that's our setter...
What's your business with him?

29
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:29,438
[SHOYO] (gasp) I...
I'm sorry! Ah!
[KENMA] Calm down.

30
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:35,410
[RYUNOSUKE]
And what about you? Shorty's
with us... So what's YOUR
business with HIM, brush head?!

31
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:36,912
(SHOYO panicking)
[YAMAMOTO] What's
it to you, buddy?

32
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:39,749
You lookin' to rumble?
Eh city boy? (growling)

33
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:42,317
[KOSHI]
Um yeah you guys ARE
about to rumble...

34
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:43,786
The game's just
about to start.

35
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:46,421
And stop saying "city
boy"; nobody says that.

36
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:47,389
(RYUNOSUKE stunned)

37
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:48,758
[YAKU]
Yamamoto please...

38
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:50,693
Could you stop picking
fights all the time?

39
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:52,227
You're making a damn
fool of yourself.

40
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:53,062
(YAMAMOTO stunned)

41
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:54,029
[YAKU]
Yeah..

42
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:55,097
that's our team idiot...

43
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:56,398
You'll just have
to excuse him.

44
00:03:56,498 --> 00:03:57,533
Sorry about ours too...

45
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,168
He's embarrassing.

46
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:01,003
(YAMAMOTO big shock)
(RYUNOSUKE startled)

47
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,910
(YAMAMOTO lovestruck)

48
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,613
[YAMAMOTO]
Girl...
hot... wow...

49
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:12,515
[INUOKA SHIBAYAMA] Sweet!
[SHIBAYAMA] Easy
on the eyes too!

50
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:13,683
[INUOKA]
Love me a girl manager!

51
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:15,618
[INUOKA SHIBAYAMA]
Yeah, yakisoba!

52
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:18,688
[YAMAMOTO]
Damn you, Karasuno!
(dramatic sobs)

53
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:20,956
[INUOKA]
Jeez, get it together,
would you?!

54
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,758
Uh Hinata...

55
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,527
How do you already
know one of those guys?

56
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:26,629
Oh, I met him earlier
while I was out...

57
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,964
I guess he's Nekoma's
setter, that's all.

58
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:31,366
A setter...
(scared)

59
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,936
[KUROO]
I look forward to
playing with you today.

60
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:36,706
And we're also looking forward
to playing with you guys.

61
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:39,374
[SHOYO] Whoa! Check this out!
[INUOKA] Hold that side.

62
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:41,010
[TOBIO]
What? It's just a gym.

63
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,178
[KUROO DAICHI, internal]
Ah, so he's the shrewd type.

64
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:46,982
[NAOI]
Man, 8 years, huh? Barely
recognized you with that
haircut.

65
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:51,353
[KEISHIN]
Yeah, well maybe you oughta
try something new once in a
while, Naoi.

66
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:54,156
(NAOI & KEISHIN chuckle)

67
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:55,424
[NEKOMATA]
Ah, Keishin!

68
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,592
[NAOI TAKEDA] Hm?
[KEISHIN] (surprised)

69
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:59,261
Coach Nekomata!
It's been a while.

70
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:03,566
I see you're still the spitting
image of your old grandfather,
aren't you, boy?

71
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,801
[TAKEDA] I‐I'm
Ittetsu Takeda, sir!
[DAICHI] Let's stretch out!
[ALL] Yes sir!

72
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:08,403
[TAKEDA]
I spoke to you on the phone;
thank you so much for your time.

73
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:10,740
[NEKOMATA] Well, after all
those dozens of phone calls,
(KURASUNO doing stretches)

74
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,509
I started feeling like I had
to respond one way or another.

75
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:15,210
Ah, I'm sorry
about that!

76
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,979
Aw, I'm just pullin'
your leg, son!

77
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,480
We've already had ourselves

78
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:20,716
several good practice games
over the past three days...

79
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:23,418
And I expect this one'll
be interesting too.

80
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,387
[TAKEDA]
Yes! Thank you, sir!

81
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:30,893
Oh, and it matters not to
me that Ukai's not here...
We'll still destroy you.

82
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:32,828
(KEISHIN & TAKEDA
straighten up)

83
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:37,533
[DAICHI]
We haven't been a team
for very long...

84
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,702
We're still kind of
finding our groove...

85
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:41,971
So we're not
very coordinated.

86
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:46,375
[DAICHI]
On top of all that, this is
our first game using our new
starting line‐up...

87
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:49,178
We don't know anything
about Nekoma as a team,

88
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:53,448
but whatever kind of
wall we find ourselves
up against today...

89
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:55,918
...we can rise above it!

90
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:58,754
[KUROO]
We are plasma.

91
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:01,023
Let's make our motions fluid.

92
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:05,961
[KUROO]
Keep the oxygen flowing so
the brain can work to its
full potential!

93
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:07,496
[KUROO]
Here we go!

94
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:08,931
[NEKOMA]
Okay!

95
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:11,166
[KENMA]
Kuroo... don't say that stuff...

96
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:12,868
It's really embarrassing.

97
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:15,805
[YAMAMOTO]
Aw, don't be like that!
It adds to the mood.

98
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:18,240
[KAI]
It helps us get into
the right mindset.

99
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,575
[KUROO]
Guess you're outnumbered.

100
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:22,011
(KENMA sigh)
(long whistle)

101
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:23,513
[TAKINOUE] Sweet! Just in time!
[DAICHI & KUROO] Line up!

102
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:25,147
[SHIMADA]
Ah yes here we go again.

103
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:28,718
Cats versus Crows!

104
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:31,186
[NAOI]
Let the practice game
between Nekoma High

105
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:34,123
and Karasuno High
officially begin!

106
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:36,859
[ALL]
Thank you for the game!

107
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,028
[DAICHI]
You don't seem as nervous today.

108
00:06:39,128 --> 00:06:40,495
[SHOYO]
Really?

109
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,599
[INUOKA]
Huh? You're tiny!

110
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,768
Gah! Don't you mock me!

111
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:47,903
I'm not mocking you
at all, dude!

112
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:48,971
Huh? Really?

113
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,739
[INUOKA]
Yup!

114
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,073
Tch!

115
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:54,143
(internal) He's as
paranoid as always.
(nervous)

116
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,211
[KENMA] Hey Shoyo.
[SHOYO] Huh?

117
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:57,580
[KENMA]
Remember when I told you

118
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,015
that I think Nekoma's
got a pretty good team?

119
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:04,787
Well, it's not because
I'm good... We all are.

120
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:07,422
[SHOYO]
Huh?

121
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:08,558
(whistle)

122
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:09,959
[KUROO]
You can do it, Kenma!

123
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:10,893
[YU]
Asahi!

124
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:11,661
[ASAHI]
I got it!

125
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:13,529
Agh, sorry, guys!

126
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,998
[YU]
That's what happens when
you skip for a month!

127
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:17,432
[ASAHI]
Uh, my bad!

128
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:18,534
[DAICHI]
Kageyama cover!

129
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:19,802
[TOBIO]
Got it!

130
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:26,809
(INUOKA, NEKOMATA
& YAMAMOTO shocked)
(SHIMADA & TAKINOUE pleased)

131
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:30,345
(whistle)

132
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:32,982
Whoa, that was crazy
fast! But how...?!

133
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:35,117
A quick‐attack from
that distance?!

134
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:38,521
How'd he do that? I mean the kid
didn't even open his eyes!

135
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:40,422
[TAKEDA & KEISHIN]
Heh heh!

136
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:44,727
[KENMA] That's amazing...
You've got skill.
[SHOYO] Huh? (laugh)

137
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:46,461
[YU]
Good job, Hinata!

138
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:47,863
[SHOYO] Thanks!
(whistle)

139
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,765
[RYUNOSUKE] Let's do this thing!

140
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:51,133
Kuah!

141
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,267
[YAKU]
Comin' atcha!

142
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,604
[YAMAMOTO]
Eat this!

143
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,305
[TOBIO]
Yes, nice receive!

144
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:57,439
(internal) Another one!

145
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,841
[INUOKA YAMAMOTO]
Agh!

146
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:03,946
(YU surprised)
(whistle)

147
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:06,448
(SHIBAYAMA breathless)
[NEKOMATA] (stunned, laughing)

148
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:08,584
Well, nobody could've
retrieved that, right?

149
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:09,719
[YU]
You got this!

150
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:11,887
(KEI smacked, annoyed)

151
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:13,656
[INUOKA]
All yours!

152
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:14,757
[YAKU]
Thanks!

153
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:16,358
[KOSHI]
Hey, nice work.

154
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,327
[YU] Oh, thanks Suga...
(whistle)

155
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:21,531
[YU] That libero of theirs
isn't playing around.
[KOSHI] Huh?

156
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:25,701
[YU] Even though he's never seen
Asahi spike... he got to it.
[DAICHI] Get ready, Hinata!

157
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:27,703
[SHOYO]
Ah! Sorry!

158
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:29,071
[YU] (surprised) Sorry, but
could you hold this for me?

159
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:30,706
[TOBIO] You're such a moron!
[KOSHI] Uh‐huh...

160
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:32,608
[YU] It's cool, guys!
[RYUNOSUKE] Go for it, Noya!

161
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,110
[TAKEDA]
Nishinoya sure moves
around a lot, doesn't he?

162
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,713
[DAICHI] Left!
[KOSHI] Yes sir... The libero
specializes in defense

163
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:39,915
so he'll come in and out
several times during a game.

164
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:42,952
[KOSHI]
Our middle blockers,
Hinata and Tsukishima,

165
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:46,121
have to go to the rear to serve,
and then after the rally's done,

166
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,724
they switch out positions
with Nishinoya.

167
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:51,527
[RYUNOSUKE]
Aw yeah, it's my turn!

168
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:53,162
[RYUNOSUKE] Yeah!
(whistle)

169
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,233
(whistle)

170
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,368
(KURASUNO cheers)

171
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:00,636
'Kay guys, now bring it in.

172
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:02,004
(long whistle)
[TAKINOUE] Wow.

173
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:03,806
That's a pretty early
time‐out don'tcha think.

174
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:07,309
[NEKOMATA]
Their spiker and libero are
extremely talented.

175
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:11,714
But their setter is the most
outrageous player in the whole
bunch.

176
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:13,816
[NEKOMATA]
That boy's a monster.

177
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:17,587
He's speed‐tossing
straight to the spiker's
optimum strike point.

178
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,089
He could thread a needle
with that control.

179
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:22,858
Well, not much you can do about
a prodigy like that.

180
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,896
But... just because they have
one genius on the team...

181
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:29,932
that doesn't necessarily
mean they'll win.

182
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,769
If their team's offense is
hinging on Hinata...

183
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,605
then we should stop him first.

184
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:36,839
[YAMAMOTO]
Who's Hinata?

185
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,841
[KUROO]
It's Karasuno's number 10.

186
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:42,244
[NEKOMATA]
Right, he and number 9
make for a deadly combination.

187
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:45,447
A demon... and his iron club...

188
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:49,451
So our first step is
taking the club away.

189
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:51,453
(whistle)
(KURASUNO celebrating)

190
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:53,422
[TAKEDA]
Alright! They're in top form!

191
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:55,925
[KEISHIN] I'm getting bad
vibes from these guys.
(TAKEDA question)

192
00:09:56,025 --> 00:10:01,063
[KEISHIN]
For some reason I get the
feeling they're scrutinizing
our every move.

193
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:04,967
(whistle)
[INUOKA] (annoyed) No way!

194
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:08,070
[YAMAMOTO]
It's okay, bro!
You were pretty close!

195
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,840
[TOBIO, internal] Their number
7's got his eye on Hinata.
[INUOKA] I'm sorry!

196
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,109
[TAKINOUE]
Nekoma decided to move
their blockers to the side.

197
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,613
[SHIMADA]
Mm‐hm... an area block.

198
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:19,048
[TOBIO, internal]
What tha...

199
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,617
That kind of block isn't
designed to track the ace.

200
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:22,852
Don't tell me...

201
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:26,455
[KEISHIN]
They're trying to lead Hinata.

202
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:30,059
[KENMA]
We have to confine Hinata
to a smaller area.

203
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:32,728
[KENMA]
From what I've seen so far...

204
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:36,131
I think he just charges straight
to wherever we don't have any
blockers.

205
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:40,770
[KENMA]
So if we block him on one side,
he'll go the opposite way.

206
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,438
And then you just
have to follow him.

207
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:44,607
You got it!

208
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:46,408
That combo move is scary...

209
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:49,512
I think anybody would be
thrown off guard the first
time they see it.

210
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:53,783
But... just like when you can't
beat a level in a game...

211
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:55,450
the more you try...

212
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,253
[KENMA]
...the better you get.

213
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:01,824
[INUOKA, internal]
Okay, I just gotta
follow number 10!

214
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,829
[TOBIO, internal]
He got to it again?!

215
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:10,299
[SHOYO]
It's a quick attack!

216
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,334
(SHOYO surprised)

217
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:14,469
[YU]
(slide) Dammit...

218
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,638
[DAICHI]
Don't let it get to you!

219
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:16,772
[TAKEDA]
A setter dump.

220
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:17,873
(KEISHIN frown)

221
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:19,642
[TOBIO]
Hey... Don't tense up.

222
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:20,776
(SHOYO look)

223
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:22,978
[TOBIO]
They see your weaknesses.

224
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,081
[DAICHI]
Front!

225
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:28,784
[RYUNOSUKE]
(slide) Sorry Noya,
can you cover it?

226
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:29,719
[YU]
Sure thing!

227
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:30,986
[TOBIO]
Right side!

228
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,455
[SHOYO]
Huh? Why's HE calling for a set?

229
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:35,490
[YU]
Kageyama.. heads up!

230
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:41,330
(RYUNOSUKE & ASAHI stunned)

231
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,398
[TOBIO]
Hey! That one's called
a straight hit!

232
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:46,435
It goes down the side!
Be selective with your spikes!

233
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:48,337
(SHOYO annoyed)

234
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:51,406
[RYUNOSUKE]
His perfectionism really
starting to piss me off. Heh...

235
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:53,208
[KOSHI]
You and me both.

236
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:58,948
[DAICHI]
Nice drop, Tsuki!

237
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:00,850
[KENMA, internal]
This guy thinks things through,

238
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,986
and he's in tune with
his surroundings...

239
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,821
He's the complete
opposite of Shoyo.

240
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,590
(whistle)
[RYUNOSUKE] Let's go!

241
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,490
[KUROO]
You got it?

242
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,225
[YAMAMOTO]
You bet!

243
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:11,594
[YAKU]
Nice receive!

244
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:13,963
[KENMA, internal]
Who do I send it to?

245
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:15,698
[KEI, internal]
To the right?

246
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:17,767
[KENMA, internal] Left.
(KEI gasp)

247
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,535
[KENMA, internal]
So he was watching closely.

248
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:21,504
He's quick too.

249
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,907
(whistle)
[NEKOMA] (celebration)

250
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:28,343
[TOBIO, internal]
That glance was just a decoy!

251
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:31,146
[NEKOMATA]
Kenma is not a fan of
interacting with people...

252
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:36,251
but he eventually became so
conscious of their eyes that he
turned it into an advantage.

253
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:39,088
[NEKOMATA]
His skills of prediction
are razor‐sharp.

254
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:41,824
He can tell a lot about
his opponents just by
observing them.

255
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:47,162
But of course, that's not what
makes our team such a force to
be reckoned with.

256
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:11,053
[KENMA]
All my life... I've never
had any luck making friends
for myself.

257
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:17,492
[KENMA]
I don't have any interest in
other people. I'm always
extremely aware of their eyes.

258
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:20,630
[KENMA]
I did all I could not
to stand out.

259
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,800
[KENMA]
Since he was my age and
lived close by, Kuroo was
my one friend.

260
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,235
(KENMA gasp)

261
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:28,303
[KENMA]
I don't like sports very much,

262
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:31,073
but I've always played around
with volleyball.

263
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:33,475
[KENMA]
When we were in middle school,

264
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:36,011
Kuroo talked me into joining
volleyball club...

265
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:38,180
It was okay, I guess.

266
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,050
[KENMA]
I kept playing it when I
got to high school...

267
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,920
Our school had a good team
my first year...

268
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,289
[KENMA]
... but there were
so many people,

269
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:49,224
I couldn't deal with
being a part of it.

270
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:52,962
[GUY B]
Hey first‐year, clean up faster
so we can go home!

271
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:55,731
[KENMA]
There's nothing special
about upperclassmen;

272
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:57,567
they were just born a
year or two sooner...

273
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,503
So why do they act like they're
better than everyone else?

274
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:06,876
[KUROO]
You can't quit... Not only do
you have greater observational
skills than us...

275
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,678
you're also a good strategist.

276
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:13,082
All the first‐ and second‐years
already know how amazing you
are...

277
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:15,718
This team's gonna go
really far with your help.

278
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:18,020
(pensive)

279
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:21,957
[TAKEDA]
He doesn't stand out.

280
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:23,392
[KEISHIN]
Huh?

281
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:25,194
[TAKEDA]
Even an amateur can
tell that Kageyama's

282
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:28,631
got a certain intense greatness
about him, you know?

283
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:32,301
[TAKEDA]
I'm not saying Nekoma's setter
ISN'T doing amazing stuff out
there,

284
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:35,304
but you wouldn't know
just by watching him.

285
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:38,207
Well yeah.. that's because
their receives are stable.

286
00:14:38,307 --> 00:14:42,612
[KEISHIN]
The most important component for
a diverse arsenal of attacks is
solid receiving.

287
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:46,015
You want receives that land
the ball neatly above the
setter's head.

288
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:52,154
The better they are, the
more room the setter has to
put his abilities to work.

289
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:56,792
[KEISHIN]
We've got Kageyama, holding this
ragtag group together with his
overwhelming talent...

290
00:14:56,892 --> 00:15:01,697
whereas Nekoma's setter is
supported by the receiving
skills of his entire team.

291
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:08,270
[KUROO]
We are plasma... Let's make
our motions fluid...

292
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,008
Keep the oxygen flowing..
so the brain can work to its
full potential!

293
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:17,246
(SHOYO grunt)
[INUOKA] One touch!

294
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,782
[YAMAMOTO]
Nice cover, Yaku!

295
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:23,953
[NEKOMATA]
We don't need a superstar
for the team ace.

296
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:26,656
[NEKOMATA]
All we have to do is keep
racking up points one by one,

297
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:28,591
slowly but surely.

298
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,561
(whistle)
(NEKOMA celebrating)

299
00:15:31,661 --> 00:15:35,164
[SHOYO]
I'm really going for it on
the next spike, so give me
a set, okay?

300
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,667
But that's really risky
for us right now...

301
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,468
One mistake and
we lose the set.

302
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:42,872
[SHOYO]
(panic) I know that! Trust me!

303
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:44,674
(whistle)

304
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:46,509
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice!

305
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:49,645
[KENMA]
But it's just like when you
can't beat a level in a game...

306
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:51,514
[KENMA]
The more you try...

307
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:57,853
(SHOYO gasps)
(TOBIO grunts)

308
00:15:57,953 --> 00:15:59,722
[KENMA]
...the better you get.

309
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:08,898
[INUOKA]
Finally got you that time!

310
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:11,366
(long whistle)
NEKOMA] (happy) Alright!

311
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:15,137
[TOBIO]
Look.. we can't get
discouraged right now...

312
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:16,739
We can take the next set!

313
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,141
There's not a spike in the world
that can't be stopped, Red...

314
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:20,710
You gotta stay focused.

315
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,044
We'll nail this
one for sure!

316
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:23,679
Kick its ass!

317
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:26,015
Right!

318
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,817
(long whistle)

319
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,819
(whistle)
[SHIMADA] Aw, not again.

320
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,886
(INUOKA triumph)

321
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:32,354
[YAMAMOTO]
Nice block, Inuoka!

322
00:16:32,454 --> 00:16:34,089
[KEISHIN]
Their Number 7's no joke.

323
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:36,892
He's got Hinata's
patterns figured out.

324
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:39,662
(SHOYO panting)

325
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:45,935
[YU]
Nice cover, Daichi!

326
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:48,003
[RYUNOSUKE] Left!
[TOBIO] Tanaka!
[KEISHIN] I can smell you
wondering

327
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:50,105
why I'm not taking
Hinata out of the game?

328
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:51,674
(KURASUNO celebrate)
[KEI] (surprised) Nope.

329
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:55,210
If this was an official game,
I probably would have...

330
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,180
but for now I'd rather give him
a chance to find a solution.

331
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,951
(SHOYO panting)
[KEISHIN] Of course, if
this makes him lose his
will to fight,

332
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:04,186
I'll take him out
in a heartbeat.

333
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,625
[TOBIO]
He juked him!

334
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:13,162
(whistle)
[RYUNOSUKE] Damnit!

335
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:14,329
[TAKEDA]
So close!

336
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:17,967
(SHOYO panting)
(NEKOMA cheers)

337
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:21,737
[KOSHI, internal]
He was completely shut down
during his first and only game
in middle school...

338
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:25,808
and now he's no match
for Tsukishima's height
in high school.

339
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:31,714
[KOSHI]
So he found a way to overcome
those setbacks and face even the
tallest opponents...

340
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:35,350
but now, even when he
uses his best attack...

341
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,554
[KOSHI]
All it takes is a single
blocker to stop him!

342
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:45,561
He's staring straight into the
"human wall". The more it stops
you, the more your heart breaks.

343
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:46,762
Huh?

344
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,101
(SHOYO panting)

345
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,135
(TOBIO shocked)

346
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:54,269
(KENMA surprised)

347
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:55,437
(KUROO surprised)

348
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:57,406
He's smiling.

349
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:58,908
Hinata...

350
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:01,777
[SHOYO] Somehow...
that was different.
[TOBIO] What?

351
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:06,148
[SHOYO]
It wasn't the same as the
confusion I felt back then.

352
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:08,317
When I couldn't see past the
blockers to the other side

353
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:12,454
and didn't know what to do.
It wasn't like that.

354
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:15,625
[SHOYO]
I can tell my opponent's having
trouble keeping up with me.

355
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:19,428
Before, all I felt was fear and
hate whenever I got blocked.

356
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:24,166
[SHOYO]
Now when a blocker stands in my
way, it's just exciting!

357
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:26,669
[SHOYO]
With your amazing sets
and a good strategy...

358
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:29,772
I think I can find a
way to get past him.

359
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:32,241
[SHOYO]
All I want is...

360
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:35,210
One more set...
How's that sound?

361
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:38,447
[TOBIO]
Yeah we'll see.

362
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:39,281
(whistle)

363
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:41,717
[YAMAMOTO]
Let's go!

364
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:47,422
(gasp)

365
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:47,990
What?

366
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,191
(shocked)

367
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,798
(whistle)

368
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:57,833
His... eyes were open...

369
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:58,934
Yeah, you're right.

370
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:00,369
Hey, what was that?

371
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:02,538
Hinata's been leaving it
up to Kageyama...

372
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:04,039
[KOSHI]
Something must be wrong!

373
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:06,175
[KEISHIN]
Hey, time out, time out!

374
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,844
(long whistle)

375
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:13,649
[SHOYO]
(panic) I‐it's not that I don't
trust you or anything, but...
uhh let's see...

376
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:15,618
Dude. What are you
freaking out about?

377
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:17,553
[KEISHIN]
Kageyama... From now on,

378
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:20,289
I want you to try sending
slightly weaker sets to Hinata.

379
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:22,658
[KEISHIN]
No more direct delivery.

380
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:29,565
So you want an
indirect delivery?
A what?

381
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:32,968
[KEISHIN]
Your sets are usually powerful
with a straight trajectory...

382
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:35,905
It needs to float a little bit.

383
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,439
[KEISHIN]
I know it's kinda
tricky to change it

384
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,842
on the spot though...
Can you handle it?

385
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:41,777
[TOBIO]
I can do it.

386
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,045
(long whistle)

387
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,480
So what's the purpose
of floating the set?

388
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,717
I want to give Hinata some
extra freedom in the air...

389
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:51,286
I noticed that he was
trying to dodge that
blocker mid‐jump just now.

390
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:52,855
[TAKEDA]
Huh?

391
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:55,024
[KEISHIN]
There's a technique for
shaking off blockers;

392
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,727
it looked like that's
what he was after.

393
00:19:57,827 --> 00:19:59,862
Too bad it was a complete
and utter failure.

394
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:01,664
(awkward laugh)

395
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:10,272
[SHOYO, internal]
Up 'til now, I could hit it
without thinking at all...

396
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:12,474
It's so weird to be the
one lining up the shot!

397
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:13,909
[KEISHIN]
One more time‐out!

398
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:15,444
(long whistle)

399
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,212
[RYUNOSUKE]
Whoa whoa whoa...
You gotta calm down, kid.

400
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:20,550
[SHOYO]
Yes, sir! I'm sorry, I just keep
screwing up over and over.

401
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,885
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey, don't even
worry about that!

402
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:25,387
Thanks to you, I always
get to hit the ball unmarked!

403
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:26,989
There's nothin' wrong with
lettin' me carry the game

404
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:28,924
every once in a while,
right buddy?
(ASAHI awkward laugh)

405
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:31,260
[YU]
Okay, but Asahi's getting
more points than you.

406
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,897
[RYUNOSUKE]
Ah! That's beside the point!
Who asked you?! Ain't that
right, Asahi?

407
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:38,734
[ASAHI]
Oh, yeah, it doesn't matter...
We're gonna win all of those
points back.

408
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:43,138
(SHOYO surprised)
[KEI] But if you keep messing
up, you're probably still gonna
get switched out.

409
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,339
(SHOYO nervous)

410
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:46,008
[RYUNOSUKE] Tsukishima!
(KEI startled)

411
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:47,877
[DAICHI]
If you're trying to learn
something new,

412
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:50,780
then you should keep at it...
You might jump all by yourself,

413
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,315
but we're all right
here to back you up.

414
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:54,684
(RYUNOSUKE grin)
(SHOYO amazed)

415
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:56,385
[DAICHI]
And besides, Mr. Ace here says

416
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,187
he's gonna win all of
those points back for us.

417
00:20:58,287 --> 00:20:59,689
[ASAHI]
(slapped) Uh. That's
not what I said.

418
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:01,557
[KOSHI]
Daichi! Don't put too much
pressure on him;

419
00:21:01,657 --> 00:21:03,425
what if he breaks into
a million pieces?

420
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:05,160
[YU]
That's right! This guy's
fragile, you know!

421
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,898
[RYUNOSUKE]
Uhh... can we just get
back to the game? Please.

422
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:10,666
(long whistle)

423
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:13,135
[YU]
Asahi!

424
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:14,604
[ASAHI]
Left!

425
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:16,371
[TADASHI]
Go!

426
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:17,673
[CHIKARA]
That was great!

427
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:19,008
(whistle)

428
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,112
[TAKEDA]
Aw, it's all he can do just to
return the ball!

429
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:27,082
[TAKEDA] Is there any way we
could make this go smoother?
[KUROO] Go for it!
[YAMAMOTO] Yes sir!

430
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:28,951
[KEISHIN]
Not even a pro can be
expected to get a play
right the first time.

431
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,220
[RYUNOSUKE] Nice receive!
[SHOYO] Right here! (leap)

432
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,423
[KEISHIN]
But every great accomplishment
begins with baby steps, you
know?

433
00:21:34,524 --> 00:21:37,660
[YAMAMOTO] Hey, I'm open!
Send it this way!
[KEISHIN] You remember
Karasuno's Tiny Giant,

434
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,462
Sure, that's the ace
Hinata wants to be like.

435
00:21:40,563 --> 00:21:44,433
He lived up to the nickname...
Only stood at about
five‐foot‐five or so...

436
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:47,036
And he kept getting blocked
whenever he first started.

437
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,672
[KEISHIN]
But by the second half
of his second year,

438
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:53,275
there was nobody who
could compete with him
in midair combat.

439
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:57,780
[KEISHIN]
He couldn't rise above the high
blockers, so he would aim for
the gap instead.

440
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,917
Sometimes he would intentionally
make the ball ricochet off their
fingertips.

441
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:06,221
And that's how he developed
his own personal style as a
smaller player.

442
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:09,191
[KEISHIN]
Well, that's what I understand
from what my grandpa anyway.

443
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,260
Former Coach
Ukai said that?

444
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,795
Yup, the one and only.

445
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:15,965
And I still remember his advice
like it was yesterday too.

446
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:22,838
[UKAI]
Man has no wings... so he
finds his own way to fly.

447
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:25,641
(INUOKA straining)

448
00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:31,480
(shocked)

449
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:39,889
(whistle)

450
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:42,157
Aagh! That's an out!

451
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:44,927
Wow, Shoyo...

452
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:46,395
That was amazing!

453
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:51,534
(pant) Once more!

454
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:26,962
[KUROO]
The small fry... Hinata, was it?
He was pretty good, even if that
last one was out.

455
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:32,434
[DAICHI]
Oh no, he's nothing compared to
that Inuoka guy, even though he
seemed kinda impressed by us.

456
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:34,403
[KOSHI]
Uh, you guys are
creeping me out.

457
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:37,206
[KOSHI]
Next Haikyu!!
"Worthy Adversaries."

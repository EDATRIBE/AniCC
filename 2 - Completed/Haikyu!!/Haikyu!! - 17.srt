1
00:00:02,275 --> 00:00:05,278
(final whistle)

2
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:13,453
[Asahi]:
It's been three months
since they defeated us.

3
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:15,322
The wall just fades away,

4
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:19,126
and then the view of the other
side is totally clear!

5
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:21,494
In the past,

6
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:25,132
I'd been able to see the view
he was talking about...

7
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:27,367
[Asahi]:
but when faced
with that iron wall,

8
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:31,438
I couldn't picture
anything beyond it.

9
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:37,244
I still wonder... what
it must look like over there.

10
00:00:37,344 --> 00:00:39,647
Rollinggggg...

11
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:43,684
Thundeeeeeeer!

12
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:45,352
[Yu]:
Again!

13
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:48,488
Alright, listen here!

14
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:51,925
You guys have nothing
to be afraid of at all!

15
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:54,327
Focus on what's in front of you!

16
00:00:54,427 --> 00:00:57,565
I promise I'll
always have your back.

17
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,636
Whoa... HE'S AMAZING!

18
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:07,675
[Captains]:
Line up!

19
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:15,883
Thank you for the game!

20
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:55,282
[Crowd]:
Go, go, Date Tech,
Date Tech, here we go!

21
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:56,917
[Oiwake]:
Listen to me, boys.

22
00:02:57,017 --> 00:03:00,120
So Karasuno surprised us
with that quick attack...

23
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,454
but it was just
the spiker's height

24
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:03,423
that threw us off,
that's all.

25
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:06,527
[Oiwake]:
Despite that incredible jumping
power, at the end of the day,

26
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:08,495
all he did was
a normal quick attack.

27
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:10,197
Don't lose sight of that.

28
00:03:10,297 --> 00:03:14,201
Just don't let him or that ace
of theirs score a single point!

29
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:16,169
They know we're
the iron wall...

30
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,639
so get out there...
and remind them!

31
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:20,774
[Team Date Tech]:
Yes sir!

32
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:23,210
[Keishin]:
From what they showed us
in round one...

33
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,279
I'm thinking they'll come out
strong with their first serve...

34
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:28,081
They as notorious
for their serves

35
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:30,017
as they are for their blocks.

36
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:32,352
[Keishin]:
Date Tech's strategy is
to tank their opponents' morale

37
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:33,854
from the get‐go.

38
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:36,023
So let's be sure to
receive high on the first one,

39
00:03:36,123 --> 00:03:37,591
you guys got
that?

40
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,659
Right!

41
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,228
Oh, and... you know
what to do, don'cha?

42
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:42,896
Yeah.

43
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:47,200
Perfect... Make me proud, team!
Let's clear that wall!

44
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,202
[Team Karasuno]:
Sir!

45
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:52,039
Karasunoooo... fight!

46
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,341
Fiiiight!

47
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:58,378
Hey, looks like Karasuno's
starting their ace

48
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,213
in the back row.

49
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:02,916
[Irihata]:
Right, probably because that's
the strongest formation

50
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:05,052
for receiving.

51
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:08,488
Date's in the same position
as the first round.

52
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,395
You can do it!

53
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:18,431
Let's go!

54
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:19,533
Bring it on!

55
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:20,634
[Moniwa]:
Do it, Kamasaki!

56
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:21,902
[Sasaya]:
Serve's up!

57
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,338
Daichi!

58
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:26,774
Nice receive!

59
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:30,744
His form is flawless.
He's able to mask where he plans

60
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:33,046
to send the set... but...

61
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:46,994
[Ryunosuke]:
Sweet! Nice moves, Hinata!

62
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:52,533
Uh‐oh! So they
DID block it!

63
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,836
And here I was thinking
we had them a step behind.

64
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:58,371
[Takeda]:
Jumping after seeing the set.

65
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:00,874
That's called
read‐blocking, right?

66
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:02,375
[Keishin]:
Yeah.

67
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,712
The other schools we've dealt
with used "commit blocks",

68
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:06,714
meaning they make the jump as
soon as they have a vague idea

69
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:08,381
of where the set is headed.

70
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:10,718
[Keishin]:
But Date Tech prefers
hardcore read‐blocking,

71
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:13,821
meaning they don't jump until
they can see the set in motion.

72
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:16,624
In other words...

73
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:20,828
...it'll be almost impossible
to fake them out.

74
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:23,731
That WOULD put them a step
behind to block it, but...

75
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:27,400
That number 7... he's so
damn big and so fast...

76
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,102
he could close
the gap, quick.

77
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:31,371
Wow, that's scary.

78
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:33,707
That read‐blocking is
gonna be a problem...

79
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:35,776
How do you think they're
going to fight it?

80
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,310
Who knows?

81
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,446
After all, Karasuno hasn't
even brought out the big guns

82
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,549
in this tournament yet.

83
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:45,553
[Daichi]:
Go for it, Kageyama!

84
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:47,487
[Shoyo]:
Yeah, get the point!

85
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:54,194
Damn! It went straight
to the libero!

86
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:56,830
That was a pretty
impressive serve, there...

87
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,632
Now if he can just learn
how to control it,

88
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:00,768
he'll be in
business.

89
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,437
Whoa, he saved it!

90
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:05,438
Amazing!

91
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,074
Tanaka, cover it!

92
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:07,875
Gotcha!

93
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:09,276
Back here!

94
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:10,644
A back attack?!

95
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:13,180
There were barely any of
those in the last game.

96
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,882
Hey, Asahi!

97
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:22,389
Man...

98
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:23,691
Oh, darn.

99
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,826
Don't let it get you
down! Keep moving!

100
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:29,830
[Crowd]:
Go, go, Aone! Way to go, Aone!
Hey, Aone! Hey, hey!
I'll get it next time!

101
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,900
Thanks, but I don't mind...
I'll do better too.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,168
C'mon, this is
a sports tournament...

103
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:36,937
You should be at
each other's throats!

104
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:39,406
What good do you think that
would do, Futakuchi?

105
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:40,708
Ow!

106
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,322
A net touch, huh?
[Daichi]:
That was lucky!

107
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:58,191
I‐It's fine!
Don't sweat it!

108
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,928
They must be really happy
that Date Tech hit the net.

109
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:03,531
Karasuno would have been
in a lot trouble.

110
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,699
They're not
half bad, though..

111
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,100
Their blocks and
their quick attacks

112
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,670
seem to work
fairly well together.

113
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,072
[Irihata]:
They've got potential.

114
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:16,009
[Moniwa]:
Nice receive!

115
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,947
I'm open!

116
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:21,148
Asahi!

117
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:30,691
Wait, I'm confused; did we
get a point for it being out?

118
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,726
Asahi, it's your serve!

119
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:41,802
Karasuno's doing a good job
of keeping the lead.

120
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:44,838
But Date Tech's not giving them
enough room to make any spikes.

121
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:47,941
Well, not the kind of
spikes they need, anyway.

122
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,442
Mm‐hm.

123
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:51,812
So far, they've been able to
narrowly avoid Date's blocks,

124
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:53,313
but if they slip up once,

125
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:55,448
they'll have the rug pulled
out from under them.

126
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:57,184
[Moniwa]:
Futakuchi!

127
00:07:58,485 --> 00:07:59,419
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice one, Hinata!

128
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,621
Seriously?

129
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,556
Chance ball!

130
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:05,726
[Oiwake]:
In a fraction of a second, we
take what was almost their point

131
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:08,328
and make it our own.

132
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:12,633
[Oiwake]:
We break their spirits while
boosting our own morale.

133
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,736
The perfect marriage
of offense and defense.

134
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:19,740
That... is the block.

135
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:29,583
[Obara]:
Nice block!

136
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:33,353
That was awesome,
Aone!... Agghhh!

137
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:37,825
They ARE called the iron wall...
And he's part of the reason.

138
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:41,328
[Keishin]:
I was right.

139
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,364
This is bad.

140
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:49,637
Dangit!

141
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,039
Just shake it off
and stay focused.

142
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,006
Huh?

143
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:55,609
Trust me... The next one's ours.

144
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,277
You think so?

145
00:08:57,377 --> 00:09:01,549
Oh! You mean... time for
whoosh?!... And kaboom?!

146
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,817
It's been quite
a while, hasn't it?

147
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:08,155
I'm gonna need your fastest
speed and your highest jump too.

148
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:10,958
And I'll bring the
ball straight to you.

149
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,994
You can count on it.

150
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:36,950
Karasuno's probably going
to use that Number 10

151
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,219
for their
fastest attack.

152
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:43,857
Still, they won't be able to get
around our iron wall.

153
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:47,260
So why aren't they acting
the least bit nervous?

154
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:50,831
[Keishin]:
When we played against Nekoma...

155
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:53,500
who can tell me why our
special technique didn't work?

156
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:56,269
Ooh! 'Cause Inuoka's
too awesome!

157
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:59,306
That's uh... not quite the
answer I was looking for,

158
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:00,708
but you're
not wrong.

159
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,676
It's because of
their middle blocker...

160
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,878
He learned Hinata's
movements.

161
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:07,515
Uh‐huh... That's it.

162
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:08,949
That wasn't all though.

163
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:11,151
Nekoma had another star player
that made things

164
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:14,254
complicated for us.
What was his name?

165
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:16,423
[Keishin]:
The one with the
two‐toned hair.

166
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,759
Kenma!

167
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:20,594
Seriously dude, what do you
have a cold or something?!

168
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:23,263
I'm fine Inuoka;
just leave me alone.

169
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:25,633
To tell you the truth,
I didn't expect them to come up

170
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,467
with a countermeasure
that quickly...

171
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,503
but once the word gets around,
every team is gonna learn

172
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:32,806
how to adapt to that
Hinata‐Kageyama combo we've got.

173
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:35,643
[Keishin]:
Don't get me wrong...
it's a deadly weapon,

174
00:10:35,743 --> 00:10:40,881
but it's not invincible...
The most important thing is...

175
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,116
[Tobio]:
Is how we use it.

176
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:50,290
Tanaka!

177
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,692
Got it!

178
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:55,028
[Tobio]:
Even flawless
read‐blocking is no match

179
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:57,430
for Hinata's
breakneck speed!

180
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:07,307
(crowd cheering)

181
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,777
That was intense!

182
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:12,880
Yeah!

183
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,182
[Hajime]:
There's that monster
quick‐attack.

184
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:16,950
[Mizoguchi]:
That move is killer.

185
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,286
It's a game‐changer...
That's for sure.

186
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:22,890
Nothing pisses me off
worse than a prodigy.

187
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,525
That was a
crazy set...

188
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,794
It's like he sent the
ball extra hard just to get

189
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,562
Aone out of the way
or something.

190
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:31,765
It had to have been calculated;
the spiker hit it perfectly.

191
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,233
There's no way they
planned to do that;

192
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,168
it must have
been a fluke!

193
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:36,537
That kid...

194
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:38,005
You ever seen him?
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice going, carrot top!

195
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:39,707
No sir...
You nailed it!

196
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:41,141
Well at least not
from the most recent

197
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:42,743
middle‐school
tournament anyway.

198
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:45,513
Was it a fluke... or not?

199
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:48,148
It's all you, Tsukishima!

200
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:49,016
Yep.

201
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:50,718
Hey, Your Highness..

202
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,352
How about a little something
a further from the net...

203
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:55,022
I'd like to stay
clear of their blockers.

204
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,025
Sure, asshole.

205
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:58,692
Huh?

206
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,327
I said sure, okay?!

207
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,362
Look, I know it's not easy
for you to take orders from us

208
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:05,498
peasant commoners, but I'm here
to win if you don't mind.

209
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,000
What?!

210
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,102
Guys, knock it off,
now's not really the time!

211
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:11,138
Looks like Kageyama
finally busted out

212
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:12,740
that quick
attack, huh?

213
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,542
Date Tech must be
shaking in their shoes...

214
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:17,277
And for good reason; you won't
find another technique like that

215
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:19,680
combo attack in
the whole world.

216
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,015
[Irihata]:
It's something
else, alright.

217
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,686
[Team Date Tech]:
Yeah!
[Tobio]:
Great job, dumbass!

218
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,487
[Shoyo]:
I'm so sorry, guys!
There's still plenty
of things they could stand

219
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:29,523
[Shoyo]:
My bad, Noya.
to improve upon though.

220
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,091
I got you!

221
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:33,594
[Moniwa]:
Show 'em what
you got, man!

222
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,601
You see, that was
just a normal Set.

223
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,403
He must have
been really lucky...

224
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:45,973
or only number 10 can
pull that move off.

225
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:47,608
Good job!

226
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:52,379
That was great,
Tsukishima, keep it up!

227
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,214
[Tadashi]:
Go, Tsukki!

228
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:01,922
Yeah! Time to take
back what's ours!

229
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:03,256
[Moniwa]:
Nice, Kamasaki!

230
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:05,158
[Sasaya]:
Yeah, that was great!

231
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,160
I don't think so!

232
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,328
Yeah!

233
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:21,441
The point gap
isn't changing.

234
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,744
That's true, but look
at the rotation.

235
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,214
[Irihata]:
Karasuno number 10's
back on the front row.

236
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,316
Oh great... him again.

237
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,952
Kageyama hasn't thrown
any of those crazy sets

238
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:34,021
since his Number 10
left the front...

239
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:35,388
And come to think of it,

240
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,324
when I saw him play
back in middle school,

241
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:39,126
[Date Coach]:
I seem to remember
him repeatedly

242
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:40,961
leaving Keetagawa's
spiker in the lurch

243
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,496
with impossible balls
just like that.

244
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:47,200
I know, and as soon
as I saw him set before...

245
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,337
I was really afraid he had gone
back to his old bad habits.

246
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:51,972
But then...

247
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:54,441
[Oiwake]:
...their number 10 hit it.

248
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,513
[Oiwake]:
Almost like it was planned out.

249
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:01,915
[Moniwa]:
Futakuchi!

250
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,251
[Kamasaki]:
That's how it's done!

251
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:06,253
Date Tech's pretty
tenacious, aren't they?

252
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:09,389
Yeah, now that Karasuno's number
10's moved up to the front...

253
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:12,960
[Spiky‐haired Guy]:
Date's best blocker
Number 7's up there too.

254
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:19,232
[Spiky‐haired Guy]:
Unstoppable force
meets immovable object.

255
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:22,135
They're probably thinking
that superhuman quick attack

256
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:24,705
was just happenstance.

257
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,239
Let's go all in!

258
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,340
Right!

259
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:33,113
[Daichi]:
It's in! Forward!

260
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:34,948
He saved it!
That's nuts!

261
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,084
[Tobio]:
Nice receive!
[Spiky‐haired Guy]:
But there's no way they

262
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:39,152
Where's he
gonna send it?

263
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:45,425
That's right!

264
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:47,661
[Daichi]:
Excellent work, you two!

265
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,863
[Tobio/Shoyo]:
Thanks!
The kid did it again! The exact
same lightning‐fast set

266
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:52,766
but even farther
back from the net!

267
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:56,269
You mean that
wasn't... just a fluke?

268
00:14:58,205 --> 00:14:59,573
[Team Karasuno]:
Let's go!

269
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:01,509
Oh, wow. Date Tech just
called for a time‐out.

270
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,144
Dude, is that
number 10 even human?

271
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:06,413
How is he able to hit
all those sets?

272
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,549
Technically it's not
the spiker who's so amazing;

273
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,483
it's the setter who
lines up the ball for him

274
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:12,019
to hit it
so perfectly.

275
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,486
Tch!

276
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:16,023
It's like watching a pair
of fine‐tuned robots...

277
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,358
We were mind‐blown
the first time, too.

278
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,327
[Oiwake]:
If that quick attack
is for real,

279
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:22,930
we won't be able
to read‐block it.

280
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,698
But if we don't
counter somehow...

281
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,100
then that'll be just as bad
as throwing in the towel.

282
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,004
[Oiwake]:
If it looks like number 10 might
attack, don't mark the set.

283
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:34,207
Mark HIM. Stay one
step ahead of his jump.

284
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:36,810
There's still the possibility
that it was just luck,

285
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,078
so keep that in mind.

286
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:39,813
Don't concentrate
too hard on it,

287
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:41,448
just stay cool
and play it by ear.

288
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,817
Right!

289
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,853
I don't think I've ever seen
anything like that before.

290
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:49,890
Do you think he's the only
one that can do that move?

291
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,324
[Moniwa]:
If that WASN'T a fluke,

292
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:53,193
then they've gotta be
some kind of monsters.

293
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:55,896
True, that quick attack
was terrifying...

294
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,631
but if we focus too
hard on that,

295
00:15:57,731 --> 00:15:59,900
they're just gonna sneak
past us with a normal attack.

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,334
It's not that
big a deal...

297
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:04,004
All we really have to do
is stop their number 10.

298
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:06,406
[Kamasaki]:
You're WAY too chill,
you know that?

299
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,075
[Futakuchi]:
Better than
having NO chill.

300
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,409
That's why you can't
get a girlfriend.

301
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,211
[Kamasaki]:
What'd you
say to me?!

302
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:13,280
Aone, You know
what to do!

303
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,986
But still... if Date
can stop that number 10,

304
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:20,253
they'll
be golden.

305
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:21,789
Hm?

306
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:23,524
I mean, he's the only Karasuno
guy who seems to be untouchable

307
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:25,726
when it comes to
Date Tech's iron wall.

308
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:27,360
Yeah, I guess so.

309
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,531
Either way, we know we have
our strategy planned out!

310
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:32,432
Yeah!

311
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,669
[Oiwake]:
We've gotta do something
about that Number 10.

312
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,672
[Team Date Tech]:
Number 10.

313
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:40,440
[Crowd]:
Number 10.

314
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:43,644
[Crowd/Team Date Tech]:
Number 10.

315
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,347
[Keishin]:
That's right Kageyama...

316
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:49,983
We're building a reputation
with everybody talking about our

317
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,318
little red 10...

318
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:54,021
So we need Hinata to
shine bright out there.

319
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,256
Bring it on!

320
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:06,634
Jeez, you're slow!
We almost missed the game!

321
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,136
Yeah well we actually had
some customers for once!

322
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,371
[Yui]:
Hurry, hurry!

323
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:14,241
Oh, good, we made it! The boys
are still playing round two!

324
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:16,276
Can't believe they're
beating Date Tech!

325
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:17,911
[Shoyo]:
Bring it here!

326
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,184
Damn, that guy
is really fast...

327
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:26,787
Whatever, we at
least tried, right?

328
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,722
Huh?... What was that?

329
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,057
So quick!

330
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:31,692
Those two are first‐years,
aren't they?

331
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:35,195
Hey did you see how high
that little guy can jump?

332
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:38,498
What are YOU
looking smug for?

333
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,100
[Koshi]:
Great work, Hinata!

334
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,669
Who's that?

335
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,437
Right! Now do another
quick attack just like that!

336
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:48,108
[Koshi]:
Make it count!
So Suga's not in the lineup?

337
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,843
[Asahi]:
Nishinoya!

338
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:53,180
Go!
Give it here!

339
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,415
Which one of them
will it be?

340
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:57,718
He's jumping!

341
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:00,821
O‐Or not?!

342
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,694
That was a
normal one.

343
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,529
So I guess they're setting
at different speeds

344
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,664
for different
situations.

345
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:14,668
You haven't seen these crazy
first‐years we just got.

346
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:17,337
They still have a lot of work to
do, but if they keep trying,

347
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:20,073
[Daichi]:
I really believe Karasuno
High's gonna have the

348
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:22,610
perfect volleyball
team one day.

349
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,245
I get it.

350
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:28,281
Damn it. Who IS
that little guy?

351
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,417
[Moniwa]:
Alright, alright!

352
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:32,152
Don't lose focus!

353
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:35,288
Remember, you're putting in
some good work out there too...

354
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:37,558
Their number 10 might
have caught you off guard,

355
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,561
but you guys have outdone all
kinds of spikers in the past...

356
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,063
Including Karasuno's ace!

357
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,398
And this time is no different!

358
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,434
Right!

359
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:48,936
Why do you keep
saying "you guys"?

360
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:50,704
You're part of this
team too, you know?!

361
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:52,640
Futakuchi...

362
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,241
And I always thought
you were just a dumb,

363
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,876
bratty underclassman!

364
00:18:55,976 --> 00:18:58,245
Wow, thanks a lot, pal.

365
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,662
YEAAAAHHH!

366
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,897
[Date Tech Fan]:
Nice kill, Aone!

367
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:19,700
Whoa, did that guy really
just jump twice?!

368
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,602
Well, I guess when
you're that enormous,

369
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,705
even a little jump can
put your hand over the net.

370
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:28,141
[Keishin]:
Not only is he tall, he's got
long arms and broad shoulders

371
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,677
to his
advantage.

372
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:32,312
But there's even
more to him than that.

373
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:34,915
He's calm enough not to get
tunnel vision,

374
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:39,052
plus he's got the tenacity
to stop the ball no matter what.

375
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:40,453
Those two traits combined,

376
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,657
are what make his blocks
so incredible.

377
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:45,859
Check it out...
Now THAT'S a block.

378
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:48,729
Yeah, that kind of technique can
completely turn things around.

379
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,898
So if Karasuno doesn't
score the next point,

380
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:53,233
then Date Tech will
just ride the wave.

381
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,768
We'll stop this too!

382
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:56,504
Yeah!

383
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:00,874
Let's go! Keep your head
in the game!

384
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:02,610
Come on!

385
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:07,447
[Moniwa]:
Futakuchi! You got this!

386
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:11,519
[Daichi]:
Cover me!

387
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:13,053
[Yu]:
All you!
[Ryunosuke]:
Open!

388
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:14,021
Center!

389
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:14,855
Hinata!

390
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:15,823
Right!

391
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,693
Yeah!

392
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:21,361
Nishinoya!

393
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:23,831
Kageyama!

394
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,165
Here!

395
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,301
Three attackers up
front... Which one?!

396
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,370
Bring it here!

397
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,111
NUMBER 10!

398
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,623
[Tobio]:
I have to create a path...

399
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,792
...for the ace!

400
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:58,599
...And then the view of the
other side is totally clear!

401
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,805
Yeah...

402
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:07,808
I remember!

403
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,687
OOOOH YEAAAAAH!

404
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,757
Hey, wasn't that...

405
00:21:23,857 --> 00:21:26,560
[Shimada]:
the same pipe
Nekoma did?!

406
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:30,698
Asahi!

407
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,134
You guys are great...
I really mean it.

408
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:35,803
Thank you so much.

409
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:37,771
[Yu]:
Are you kidding me?
That was all you, dude!

410
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:39,840
[Tadashi]:
Good job, Asahi!

411
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,011
Please blaze a trail
for Asahi too!

412
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:48,949
Yes!

413
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,284
Hey, what's the matter?

414
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:55,155
Well, I... I wasn't the one
who scored that last point.

415
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:56,890
I can't take
the glory...

416
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:02,429
NUMBER 10!

417
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:08,602
But still, it...
it felt really good.

418
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:15,909
Like I said, decoy...
Your job is just as cool.

419
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:23,717
The greatest decoy...
I get it.

420
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:26,754
Alright... At this point,
we've showed 'em every weapon

421
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:29,022
we've got
in our arsenal.

422
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:35,729
[Keishin]:
Now... the real work begins.

423
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:09,557
[Aone]:
It's changed.

424
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,591
[Futakuchi]:
What's changed, Aone?

425
00:24:10,691 --> 00:24:12,593
[Aone]:
Karasuno.

426
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:14,595
[Futakuchi]:
No kidding! Now that they have
that setter and the short guy,

427
00:24:14,695 --> 00:24:15,929
it's hard to figure
out where to block‐

428
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,965
[Aone]:
The manager's
girly hairstyle.

429
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:21,935
[Futakuchi]:
Oh, that? Our next Haikyu!!
"Back Protection."

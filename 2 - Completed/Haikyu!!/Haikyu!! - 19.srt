1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,509
(whistle blows)

2
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,097
That's rough!

3
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:28,433
Yeah, that makes the
4th service ace in a row.

4
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:30,769
He's obviously got
quite a lot of power...

5
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,705
but that control
is simply unreal.

6
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:36,609
Okay... but if we can
deal with that serve...

7
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:39,011
It's true that his
serve is nasty...

8
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:41,580
[Koshi]:
but the worst thing is,
we don't know anything about him

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,447
as a setter.

10
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:43,849
One more, like that!

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,084
(whistle blows)

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,825
[Crowd]:
Ooooooolé!

13
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:54,593
[Omisaki #2]:
Sorry!
[Yutaro]:
Chance ball!

14
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:56,261
I got this one!

15
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,496
Okay!

16
00:00:58,597 --> 00:01:02,234
Yeah, the thing
about setters...

17
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:05,838
[Keishin]:
They're a lot like
conductors for an orchestra.

18
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,042
You can have the same song
and the same musicians...

19
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:13,979
but changing the conductor gives
you a whole different sound.

20
00:02:58,517 --> 00:03:03,021
Aoba‐Johsai... Their teamwork
seems to be really polished.

21
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:05,658
See that number 4
on the left side?

22
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:09,127
That is Hajime Iwaizumi.

23
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:11,797
[Tobio]:
I heard he's played with Oikawa
since elementary school.

24
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:14,499
They have almost a
psychic connection.

25
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,368
I don't think the
vibe's different

26
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:18,771
because the junior setter they
used during the practice game

27
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:21,339
a while back was no good
or anything like that...

28
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,241
I mean,
he's at Seijoh.

29
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:24,610
True.

30
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,779
But... this Oikawa
character here...

31
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,915
[Keishin]:
He seems to know his team so
well that he's able to conduct

32
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:34,186
them all at 100% of their
potential. Impressive.

33
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:38,691
[Shoyo]:
The Great King
is awesome!

34
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:40,559
I wanna play him!

35
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:41,994
Me too!

36
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:43,361
I hope he aims one of
those serves at me!

37
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:44,663
[Yu]:
Oh, man...

38
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:46,364
[Shoyo]:
You're cool
too, Noya!

39
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:47,966
Someone's excited.

40
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:51,403
Hey Hinata! Look over
there! The Paparazzi!

41
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:54,172
[Shoyo]:
A TV camera! Sweet,
we're gonna be famous!

42
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:57,342
[Committee Member]:
Hey, you two!
Middle sc‐

43
00:03:57,442 --> 00:04:01,980
Sorry, elementary schoolers...
Please, keep it down, alright?

44
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:04,116
Sure...

45
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:05,784
Sorry, mister...

46
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,758
(final whistle)

47
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,081
Wow, it's quiet
for once.

48
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:38,584
Because everyone's
exhausted.

49
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:40,052
We played two games...

50
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:42,054
But we won both in
straight sets though,

51
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:44,156
so it could be
a lot worse.

52
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:46,892
[Keishin]:
If we win tomorrow, we'll be
up to two full games a day,

53
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:48,994
PLUS the opponents
will be tougher.

54
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:51,463
We'll have to work hard
to keep the energy up.

55
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:52,931
Right.

56
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:01,173
Okay, meeting time,
everybody.

57
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:03,976
(yawning)

58
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:06,444
You kids have
got to see this!

59
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:07,813
Get your butts in here,

60
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:09,615
the volleyball club
is on television!

61
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:11,617
What?! TV?!

62
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:13,218
[Shoyo/Yu/Ryunosuke]:
Show us!

63
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,186
[Koshi]:
Please?

64
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,189
Duuude!

65
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:18,557
We're on TV!

66
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:19,925
Awesome!

67
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:22,027
You do know that's
just the local news...

68
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:22,861
Quiet!

69
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,897
It's still
cool, alright?!

70
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:28,734
[Female Anchor]:
Champion ace Wakatoshi Ushijima
from Shiratorizawa Academy

71
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:32,370
in Block I set his team off
to a great start today...

72
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,508
These reigning champs kept the
momentum going from last year

73
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:39,044
by scoring 25 to 10
against the opposing team

74
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:41,479
from Ougi South High School
during the first set,

75
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,551
and a devastating 25 to 6
in the second set.

76
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:48,153
Did she say "25 to 6"?

77
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:52,124
[Female Anchor]:
They won by a landslide,
never once losing the lead.

78
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:55,928
With that kind of skill, it's
easy to see why Shiratorizawa's

79
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:58,430
worthy of the Inter‐High title.

80
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:03,035
That said... Block A seems
to be the group to watch.

81
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,303
That's the gym
we played at today!

82
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:08,841
[Female Anchor]:
And the PLAYER
to watch is Toru Oikawa,

83
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:10,743
the team captain
from Aoba‐Johsai High.

84
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:13,812
(growling)
Not only is he talented,
but his striking good looks

85
00:06:13,912 --> 00:06:17,883
and personality make him popular
with female fans as well.

86
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:20,152
The next opponent,
of Aoba‐Johsai

87
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:22,220
made a strong
impression today...

88
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,156
[Female Anchor]:
beating Date Tech
in straight sets

89
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,925
despite every little
indication that Date

90
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:29,562
would go on to the Best 8.

91
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:30,495
Karasuno High.

92
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,898
Yeah!

93
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:35,367
[Ryunosuke]:
What?! It's THAT douche?!

94
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:38,704
[Female Anchor]:
We asked the captain for his
thoughts about facing Karasuno

95
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:40,806
in round three tomorrow.

96
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:42,708
Karasuno's a decent team...

97
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:46,945
I hope they do their best...
so that we can annihilate them.

98
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:50,649
[Female Anchor]:
I'm sure everyone watching
hopes the best team wins!

99
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:53,819
Coming up next, it's time
for the local weather.

100
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,522
Let's go to Komata over
at the Sendai Station.

101
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:59,191
Ah! They showed your game
for a second or two

102
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,793
at the start
of the broadcast!

103
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:02,595
You all looked
very impressive to me!

104
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:04,129
Listen, sir...

105
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:05,598
We get what you're trying
to do, alright...?

106
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:07,199
Um... sorry!

107
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:09,668
[Daichi]:
We should probably
get going guys.

108
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,437
Let's go.

109
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:13,739
I messed everything up!

110
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,675
I‐I‐It's just a
meeting! Come on!

111
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:19,612
[Keishin]:
Alright, today's game
with Date Tech...

112
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:22,981
it's sorta like...
your first sip of beer!

113
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:27,085
The first sip of a
beer tastes the best...

114
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:29,555
It's great! There's
nothing like it!

115
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:30,989
Um hey Coach...

116
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,458
could you put that into
terms minors can understand?

117
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,527
Ah...

118
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:40,766
Well... by using the Date Tech
game to debut that freak quick

119
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:42,434
we've been workin' on,

120
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:45,037
we were able to take the enemy
by surprise, you know?

121
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:47,405
[Keishin]:
But we've played
against Seijoh before,

122
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:51,009
so they already know most of
what's in our bag of tricks.

123
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:53,211
That said...

124
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:55,480
you need to remember that you
guys still have a great deal

125
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:57,750
of offensive power.

126
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,154
[Keishin]:
The first step is surviving
that serve Oikawa does...

127
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:05,290
We can't let it control
the flow of the game.

128
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,362
Because if that happens, we're
toast. So try to be careful.

129
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:13,498
[Keishin]:
As you know, our current
formation is based on all of you

130
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,735
except the setter
going after the serves.

131
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:19,071
But this time, I want
our two middle blockers

132
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:20,839
to focus entirely
on attacks

133
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:23,008
and not participate
in serve‐receives.

134
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,910
You got that, boys?

135
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,911
Yeah...

136
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:27,513
I guess...

137
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:30,616
Hey, it's called division of
labor. Cheer up little Ginger.

138
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:32,250
Oh, also...

139
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,154
Seijoh made you think... "Whoa..
They're tough. We're screwed."

140
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:37,422
That sound about right?

141
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,691
Huh?

142
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,192
[Keishin]:
But think.

143
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:42,360
What if we had been watching
ourselves in that game?

144
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,231
If we were able to see it from
the spectators' perspective?

145
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:49,267
[Keishin]:
We'd be sayin' "Check out
that block, it's terrifying!

146
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:52,571
No way are we gonna win!"
We'd be losing it!

147
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:58,376
But we took those guys on...
and won. And we can do it again.

148
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:07,085
YEAH!

149
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:09,221
Alright! Let's run
through the formation

150
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:10,956
while we've still
got some time!

151
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:12,490
[Team Karasuno]:
Yes, sir!

152
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:15,360
[Mori]:
Hey Coach.

153
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:17,295
Oh, Mori!

154
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:19,832
Here you go.
It's today's game.

155
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:22,067
[Keishin]:
Ah, thank you!

156
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,803
Next time we go
drinking... it's on me.

157
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:28,774
Aw yeah, that's what I'm talkin'
about! I'm holdin' you to it!

158
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:30,776
Oh, is that
the Aoba‐Johsai game?

159
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,745
Yeah... Sure is.

160
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:35,748
It'll be a big help, but I don't
expect us to magically overcome

161
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:39,251
Oikawa's serves just
by watching it today.

162
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:43,055
But then again, though...
it's better than nothing, right?

163
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:45,423
Wow, Coach, next time
your drinks are all on me!

164
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:49,094
Sweet talker! See you
tomorrow. Don't be late!

165
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:50,763
[Team Karasuno]:
Yes, sir!

166
00:09:56,134 --> 00:09:59,738
[Toru]:
Listen carefully. The Inter‐High
tournaments are coming up.

167
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:03,341
My special protégé, I'm wanna
crush you fair and square

168
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:06,411
at an official game where
we both play the setter.

169
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:15,020
Is it just me...

170
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,423
or is Kageyama more tense
than he usually is?

171
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:19,858
Here he goes.

172
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,393
Stop frowning,
Kageyama!

173
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:23,195
If you don't, you're gonna
get wrinkles and you'll end up

174
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:24,930
looking like a
gross old grandpa!

175
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,164
Huh?!

176
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:29,201
Tomorrow...
That guy's going down.

177
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:33,506
Can we...
really stop Oikawa?

178
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:35,608
Not only that,
but we're gonna be on TV

179
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,843
so you need to practice
smiling for the camera too!

180
00:10:37,943 --> 00:10:39,512
Oh give me a
frickin' break!

181
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:43,115
If we're gonna win this... We're
gonna have to stay focused!

182
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:47,319
Sweet!

183
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:54,092
[Yutaro]:
Goodnight, captain!

184
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,428
[Toru]:
Uh‐huh! See ya.

185
00:10:57,062 --> 00:11:03,536
[Toru]:
(humming)

186
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:04,570
Huh?

187
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:12,711
Hey... Tomorrow's a big day;
so don't stay up too late.

188
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:15,914
Oh really, now...
What are you, my mother?

189
00:11:17,616 --> 00:11:19,384
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
I take it back!

190
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:21,319
I'll be there, bright‐eyed
and bushy‐tailed, I promise!

191
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,623
Don't you worry!
[Yutaro]:
I don't have time
for this, Loserkawa.

192
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:27,993
I have to lock up the club room,
so move your ass, Lazykawa!

193
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:29,161
[Toru]:
I don't like
these names...

194
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:30,529
[Yutaro[:
Shittykawa then!

195
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,497
[Toru]:
Now you're just
being vulgar!

196
00:11:54,987 --> 00:11:58,591
Wait a sec...
Could this kid be...?

197
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:25,450
[Crowd]:
You try to get all in our space,
we'll slam that ball

198
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:27,385
back in your face!

199
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:54,580
[Cheer Leader]:
Let's go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

200
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,915
[Crowd]:
Go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

201
00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:59,451
[Cheer Leader]:
Go go, Sei‐Sei‐Sei‐S‐SeiJOH!

202
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:02,555
[Crowd]:
Go go, Sei‐Sei‐Sei‐S‐SeiJOH!

203
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,626
May the best
team win today.

204
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:09,461
We plan to.

205
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:12,631
Karasuno cleared the
first day... Not bad!

206
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,633
I had to take another
day off for this.

207
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,135
Guess I can forget
vacation for a while.

208
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:18,470
Got that right.

209
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:21,306
You know, Date Tech had
a supportive crowd...

210
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:22,608
but this...

211
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,543
[Oikawa Fangirls]:
Ready, go!

212
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:29,481
Go Oikawa!
You're amazing!

213
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:30,816
This is
something else.

214
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,752
I'm not losing
to these assholes!

215
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:35,854
YEAAAAAAH!

216
00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:39,992
Coach. Looks like we've
got the opening serve.

217
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:40,826
Alright.

218
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:45,631
Okay! Now!

219
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:48,834
Good luck, Oikawa!
We love you

220
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,235
Karasuno High...

221
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:52,270
[Daichi]:
Fight!

222
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,006
[Daichi]:
Fight!

223
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:55,307
[Daichi]:
Fight!

224
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:56,842
[Daichi]:
Fight!

225
00:13:58,644 --> 00:14:00,779
[Daichi]:
Now let's do
some serves!
They're sure

226
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,248
Oh! Hey, uh, that
apprentice of yours,

227
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:04,650
how are his serves
coming along?

228
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,853
Well, I wouldn't
say "apprentice."

229
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:09,321
The jump float serve...

230
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,456
do you think you could
teach me how to do it?

231
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:12,858
That was only
a week ago.

232
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,160
[Shoyo]:
Come on!

233
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,995
He might just
pull off a fluke...

234
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:20,833
but he's got a long way to go
before he can really do it.

235
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:28,674
Excellent work, Makki!
You are sharp as ever.

236
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:33,378
Hey, I'm sorry, Kindaichi...

237
00:14:33,478 --> 00:14:35,347
That was a bit high
for my taste.

238
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:37,583
Um... okay...
Right!

239
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:42,320
Our little Iwa seems
kind of tense today!

240
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,022
Hey, you shouldn't
worry yourself too much

241
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:45,591
about looking good...

242
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:49,427
After all, the girls are too
busy watching me to notice you.

243
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:50,896
I really gotta
hand it to him;

244
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:54,432
Oikawa pays pretty close
attention to his teammates.

245
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:57,369
I can't make an informed
assessment of their technique...

246
00:14:57,469 --> 00:15:00,839
but I can tell that
Seijoh's got strong chemistry.

247
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:02,575
They're so in sync.

248
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,146
Really?

249
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:12,484
Hey, let's line up guys!

250
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:08,140
For the first time, I'm playing
against him in an official game.

251
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:16,181
Thank you for the game!

252
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:20,118
Alright, the game's about to
start! Time for round three!

253
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:21,654
Who's gonna make
the Best 8?

254
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:23,088
It's an
interesting matchup.

255
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:26,191
Yeah, but Aoba‐Johsai's
got this one in the bag.

256
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,427
[Toru]:
Oh, Tobio?

257
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:32,064
I came here looking forward
to defeating a setter

258
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:33,599
who's worthy
of facing me.

259
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:37,002
So at least...
try to keep up.

260
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:40,105
Let me tell you somethi‐

261
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:41,674
We're not gonna lose!

262
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:45,110
Hinata, you idiot! Can't you
be quiet for five minutes?!

263
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:47,813
We'll beat you.

264
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:51,483
Just like last time!

265
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:54,486
Let's go, S‐S‐S‐S‐SeiJOH,

266
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:56,922
[Crowd]:
Go, go, S‐S‐S‐S‐SeiJOH,

267
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:58,991
[Cheer Leader]:
You can do it, S‐S‐S‐S‐SeiJOH,

268
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:02,127
[Takeda]:
Remember, guys! You've
beaten Aoba‐Johsai before.

269
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,830
They may not have been
at their best last time,

270
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,600
but I still think the fact that
we've overpowered them once

271
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,503
already is good enough
reason to be confident.

272
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:14,006
Not to be cocky!
But confident.

273
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:15,073
[Team Karasuno]:
Sir!

274
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:17,442
[Daichi]:
Karasunooo, fight!

275
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:19,077
[Team Karasuno]:
Fiiight!

276
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:21,847
Well then, let's do
this thing, shall we?

277
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:24,550
Just like we
did yesterday.

278
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:29,622
Don't let me down,
fellas... alrighty?

279
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,994
That was... intense.

280
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:39,932
[Takinoue]:
Aoba‐Johsai's mood
just did a 180.

281
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:42,735
He says that
before every game.

282
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:45,337
Coming from him, that kind of
thing can sound like a joke,

283
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:49,107
but to his teammates, it's as
serious as a heart attack.

284
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:52,477
They know that he's saying
exactly what he means,

285
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:54,379
and they respect
him for it.

286
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:57,983
[Irihata]:
That's why they put all
their trust in him in return.

287
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:00,919
Here we go!

288
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:02,621
Yeah!

289
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:43,228
[Daichi]:
Let's see it, Tsukki!

290
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:44,797
Kunimi!

291
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:46,665
Right!
Good one!

292
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:48,466
Look, two of them are
getting ready to jump!

293
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:49,568
Interesting...

294
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:51,203
I'm open!

295
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:53,672
[Tobio]:
It's been a while since
I saw him set a ball up

296
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:55,307
from this close.

297
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,886
(crowd cheering)

298
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:09,822
[Takinoue]:
A setter dump,
right off the bat?!

299
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:18,797
Work it Owikawa, Work it
Owikawa! Get thaaat Point!

300
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,401
Really?!

301
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:24,937
A setter dump...?

302
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:27,305
That's when the setter
makes an attack, right?

303
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:30,242
I'll give you a little hint;
I'm about to do that again...

304
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:33,378
Pay attention this time and
maybe you'll be able to stop me.

305
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:39,518
Hey... is he really serious
about doing another setter dump?

306
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:41,620
People never do those
moves twice in a row.

307
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,288
Making you think that

308
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:45,057
is exactly how they trick
you into screwing up.

309
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:47,560
Aah, so THAT'S it!
You're really smart, Tanaka!

310
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,094
Alright
cut it out,

311
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:50,829
there's no sense in
psychoanalyzing it...

312
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,631
That's just like
trying to predict

313
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:54,032
what somebody's next
move is going to be

314
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:56,802
in a game of
rock‐paper‐scissors.

315
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:58,671
[Daichi]:
Don't think
too hard.

316
00:19:58,771 --> 00:19:59,938
[Shoyo/Ryunosuke]:
Okay!

317
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:02,240
[Hajime]:
Matsukawa's serve!

318
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,642
Stay focused!

319
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:05,177
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice one, Cap!

320
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:06,244
[Ryunosuke]:
B!

321
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:07,780
Bring it this way!

322
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,515
Hey, it's Number 10!

323
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:10,983
He's gonna do it!

324
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:15,721
[Brown‐haired Guy]:
It's that quick attack!

325
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,990
Crap... this
one's head‐on!

326
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,358
Hey! Check out
the Seijoh setter!

327
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:25,330
[Takinoue]:
It's gonna be another dump...
but way more obvious, this time!

328
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,032
Nice try!

329
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:35,841
He just changed from
a spike... to a set!

330
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:41,479
Hey... that
was too low.

331
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,448
Oh yeah?
My bad...

332
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,083
But well,
y'know, Iwa...

333
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,952
you do always seem to
hit them either way.

334
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:48,521
Did you
see that?!

335
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:50,523
They're so good,
it kinda pisses me off!

336
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:53,258
Oh, Oikawaaaa!

337
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:56,028
He's so incredible!

338
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:57,930
They're a lot tougher
than I thought...

339
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,698
What the hell are
they feeding these kids?

340
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:01,299
Well... it may be true...

341
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:04,803
that we won a practice
game against Aoba‐Johsai...

342
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:06,438
[Takeda]:
...but like you said,

343
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,841
now that they've got
their official conductor...

344
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:11,109
the tune is
different.

345
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:13,078
Crap.

346
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:14,980
[Daichi]:
Relax, you two.

347
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,850
Listen, we already knew
Oikawa was good, remember?

348
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,286
Our setter and our attacks
are impressive too...

349
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:23,021
We can win this.

350
00:21:23,455 --> 00:21:24,923
Right!

351
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:28,260
[Hajime]:
Give us another one, Matsukawa!

352
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:30,295
[Daichi]:
Nishinoya!

353
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:31,363
Gotcha!

354
00:21:31,463 --> 00:21:34,066
Okay! Bring it to me!

355
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:40,939
[Hajime]:
Number 5!

356
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:44,877
Ooh! They
faked him out!

357
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:52,551
A pipe?!

358
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:17,910
(crowd cheering)
[Brown‐haired Guy]:
He did a setter dump too!

359
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,412
That guy must
really hate losing.

360
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,080
That was pretty amazing!

361
00:22:24,683 --> 00:22:26,151
Oikawa.

362
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,286
That's our
next play too...

363
00:22:28,386 --> 00:22:31,389
So I suggest that
you pay attention.

364
00:22:32,157 --> 00:22:33,491
That so?

365
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,394
You little prick...

366
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,822
[Toru]:
Tobio's Kageyama's
an insufferable brat.

367
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:12,525
[Hajime]:
Look who's talking; you were the
first one to do a setter dump‐

368
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,327
[Toru]:
Luckily I have
you guys! Group hug!

369
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:17,930
[Hajime]:
Yeah, you're way more
annoying than he is.

370
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,667
Next Haikyu!!
"Toru Oikawa is No Genius."

1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,049
(sneakers squeaking on court)

2
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:06,450
(hitting ball)

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,019
[SHOYO] (faceplant)

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,753
Dammit, stop dragging your feet!

5
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:13,757
What happened to those
reflexes you had? Get it
together!

6
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:16,995
[SHOYO]
(grunt) All I'e been
doing is receives...

7
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:21,199
Kageyama, we're running out
of time! I wanna jump around!
I wanna do some spikes!

8
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:22,333
[TOBIO]
Well that's too bad!

9
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:23,835
[RYUNOSUKE]
That's enough!

10
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:25,937
A word to the wise.

11
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:28,106
Daichi's a nice guy
most of the time,

12
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:31,843
but you will NOT like him
when he's mad. Trust me.

13
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:35,746
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Yeah, we know.

14
00:00:35,847 --> 00:00:38,349
If he were to find out
we're practicing early...

15
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:39,851
I'm so dead. (realize)

16
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:41,853
Not that I'm afraid
of him or anything!

17
00:00:41,953 --> 00:00:44,923
Of course not; that would be
ridiculously ridiculous!
[SHOYO TOBIO] Hm?

18
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:50,929
[RYUNOSUKE] Anyway, it's
probably for the best if we keep
this little practice session a
secret between the three of us‐

19
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:54,298
(startled)
[KOSHI] Aha! Just
as I suspected!

20
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:56,200
[RYUNOSUKE] Suga!
[KOSHI] Hey.

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,902
[RYUNOSUKE] How'd you know?!
[SHOYO, internal] The
third‐year.

22
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:00,571
[KOSHI] Come on.
Something was obviously up...

23
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:02,841
I mean, why else would you
offer to take the key to the gym

24
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:05,309
when you always show up to
practice at the last minute?

25
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,111
[RYUNOSUKE]
(startled) (nervous)

26
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:09,713
Don't worry, I won't tell;
your secret's safe with me.

27
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:13,584
[KOSHI]
A clandestine crash course;
that's pretty exciting.

28
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:16,087
(breath of relief)

29
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:53,251
[RYUNOSUKE]
(battle roar, into spike)

30
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:55,920
[RYUNOSUKE] Whoo, I'm on fire!
[KOSHI] (hit effort)
[SHOYO] (bonked)

31
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,789
(annoyed) Hey, you're
not paying attention.

32
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:01,926
[SHOYO]
Hey, I wanna hit too! Throw
me a bone here, Kageyama!

33
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:04,662
you're all about
your sets, aren'tcha?

34
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:08,432
Go ahead, send one
over this way!

35
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:13,137
[SHOYO] Come on, just one!
For practice! Please?
[KOSHI] I don't think
he wants to.

36
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:15,439
[TOBIO] No.
[ALL] (stunned)

37
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,341
[SHOYO]
Aw man, don't be like that!

38
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:19,543
[RYUNOSUKE]
Yeah, dude, send him one!

39
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,980
[SHOYO]
Mmph! Fwup! ...Ah.

40
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:24,783
I sent that one head‐on...

41
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:27,051
You received to make
a set and attack...

42
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:29,520
Don't run your mouth if
you can't follow through.

43
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,592
[TOBIO] I'll be sending all the
sets to Tanaka during the match
on Saturday.
[SHOYO] (surprised)

44
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:40,764
[TOBIO] Leave all the attacking
to him... You just do your best
to not get in my way.
[SHOYO] (angry)

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,769
[SHOYO]
Okay fine, then as soon as I
get good enough at receives.

46
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,172
Will you at least throw
a few sets to me too?

47
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:51,943
[TOBIO]
I'll set to whoever
I have to to win.

48
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:57,115
It's just... I highly doubt that
person is going to be you.

49
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,918
[SHOYO] (surprised)
(extended angry breaths)
[RYUNOSUKE] Watch your mouth!

50
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:02,553
[KOSHI]
How's he ever gonna learn
if you don't set to him?

51
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:04,388
[TOBIO]
It's almost 7.
We should clean up.

52
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:06,991
[RYUNOSUKE]
Oh, crap! Hurry up!‐
We can't leave any traces!

53
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:10,261
[KOSHI] (worried)
We need to find a mop!
[SHOYO] Rrghh...

54
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,696
(courtyard chatter)
[SHOYO] Dammit!

55
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:17,401
[HIKARA] (snooze)

56
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:21,840
[RYUNOSUKE] (snoring)
(GIRLS giggling)

57
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:27,111
[SHOYO]
(startled) (disappointed)

58
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:29,781
[KOSHI]
Try this... Drop your hips down
a little bit lower

59
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:33,184
and hit the ball like you're
trying to return it to exactly
where it came from.

60
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:34,252
[SHOYO]
Okay!

61
00:04:34,352 --> 00:04:36,520
[KOSHI]
Here we go!

62
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,022
[SHOYO]
Ooh, nice one!

63
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:40,224
[KOSHI]
Hey, Hinata. How about I start
setting

64
00:04:40,324 --> 00:04:42,093
for you tomorrow morning?
Would you like that?

65
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:44,628
[SHOYO]
(look) (gasp) You
mean it?! Really?!

66
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:47,731
Well, I am Karasuno High's
official setter, after all...

67
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:49,868
And you want to
practice spikes, right?

68
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:53,104
Exactly! Spikes are my
favorite thing to do!

69
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:56,507
When you hit the ball just
right... It feels so cool!

70
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:59,944
[KOSHI]
(laugh) I guess you really got
a thing for spikes, don't you?

71
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:03,848
Yeah... When I was in middle
school, I could barely get
teammates at all,

72
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:06,517
much less a setter to toss
practice balls with me.

73
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:09,653
[SHOYO]
I used to get my friend in
basketball club to help me out.

74
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:14,225
Hup! Ah, oops, sorry, I hit
it the wrong way again!

75
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:19,497
[SHOYO]
After I dropped out of the club,
I would ask the first‐years, the
setters from the girls' team,

76
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:22,766
and pretty much anybody
who didn't say no to
practice with me.

77
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:26,104
I made a lot of
friends along the way...

78
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:30,041
But none of those people could
ever become my real teammates.

79
00:05:31,642 --> 00:05:35,313
[SHOYO]
That's why... I was so
excited to see who the
setters were here.

80
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:36,815
You're an idiot.

81
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:38,516
And now, uh...

82
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:39,450
You're clumsy.

83
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,418
(piano slam)

84
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:41,685
...you know the rest.

85
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:43,822
Well like I said,
I'm a setter too...

86
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:45,323
I'll toss you a few, okay?

87
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:49,861
[SHOYO]
(excited) (piano slam) That'd be
nice, but...

88
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,330
if I were to say yes after
telling you all that...

89
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,566
it kinda feels like... I would
be admitting that he beat me.

90
00:05:55,666 --> 00:06:00,738
(awkward sigh) So why do you get
so competitive when it comes to
Kageyama?

91
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,010
[KOSHI]
If you ask me, it's better to
avoid making enemies with guys
like that.

92
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,880
[SHOYO]
That day at the tournament...

93
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,549
Kageyama was so good at
everything he did.

94
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:15,319
And he was way taller
than me... and stronger.

95
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,723
[SHOYO]
It just really bothered
me to see him standing
in my way like that.

96
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:21,392
[KOSHI]
Yeah, I think I get it.

97
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:23,127
[TOBIO] (yawn)

98
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:26,764
[SHOYO]
That's why I came to Karasuno...
because I want to beat him!

99
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:29,400
[KOSHI]
Really? If he's the reason you
came here...

100
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,636
Then is he whole the reason
you play volleyball in the
first place?
[TOBIO] hm?

101
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:34,738
[SHOYO]
Ah! Um, well...

102
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,841
[TOBIO, internal]
Is he practicing during lunch?

103
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:40,711
[SHOYO]
I just think that if I can get
strong enough to finally win
against Kageyama...

104
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:44,682
then I will be able to
stand up to all kinds
of tough opponents...

105
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:47,351
cause I've never seen
anyone play like him.

106
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:50,254
I don't ever want to lose again!

107
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:53,624
[KOSHI]
I see. So what you're saying is,

108
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:56,060
if you had to rank all the
players in your own age group,

109
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,863
you'd give Kageyama the
top spot? That's quite
an endorsement.

110
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:03,767
[SHOYO]
(startled) (groaning) Well...

111
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:07,138
[KOSHI, internal]
He doesn't want to admit it.

112
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:10,474
[KOSHI] He's no longer your
most powerful enemy...
[SHOYO] (listen)

113
00:07:10,574 --> 00:07:13,945
[KOSHI] Now, he's your
most powerful ally.
[SHOYO] (think)

114
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:17,615
I can do everything
without your help.

115
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:20,651
[SHOYO] (seething)
[KOSHI] (laugh)

116
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,453
[KOSHI]
Anyway, let's do some receives.

117
00:07:22,553 --> 00:07:24,022
[SHOYO] Sure!

118
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:29,360

Thanks for taking out the trash!

128
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,927
[TOBIO] Let's go.

129
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:06,264
[SHOYO]
What?! Sorry, where are we
going now?

130
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:11,002
Well it's not like we can play
volleyball here, can we? I found
a practice spot.

131
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:15,239
Ah? Really?! Where is it?!
Wow, great job, Kageyama!

132
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,608

Oh my God, you're so annoying!

sleepier than usual.

O‐oh, really? Maybe I've
been studying too hard or
something...

137
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:53,744
[RYUNOSUKE] I've been
studying hard too!
[KOSHI] It doesn't sound very
convincing when YOU say it!

138
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:55,513
[RYUNOSUKE] Eat it!
[KEI] Excuse us.

139

week to start new members,

141
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:05,356
[DAICHI] but since we have that
match on Saturday,
[KAZUHITO] Wow, they'e huge.

you to focus!

and get let into the gym!

00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:31,215
If we lose on Saturday, you
don't ever get to be the setter.

153
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:33,617
[TOBIO]
That's why I need you to focus!

154
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,556
[SHOYO]
Gaah!

155
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:42,293
[SHOYO]
I told you, you gotta ease
up a little when we're
practicing outside!

156
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:45,596
[TOBIO]
If you could receive worth a
damn, I wouldn't have to!

157
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:48,867
[SHOYO] Pardon me... your
Majesty.

158
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,434
What?

159
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:52,370
[SHOYO]
(scared) Uh‐oh.

160
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,038
[TOBIO]
Tch.

161
00:09:56,107 --> 00:10:00,278
[SHOYO, internal]
What's with him? He doesn't like
being King of the Court?

162
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:02,446
I think that's a
pretty cool nickname.

163
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:08,319
Hey, I wonder if I'll get
a nickname too? Just like
the Tiny Giant!

164
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:12,723
The Wind of the... Whirlwind!
No wait, that' too much wind.

165
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:19,931
The Forest... no that's lame...
the Shadowy, um... The North
Eastern... Tornado?

166
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,900
[TOBIO] Hey! Pull your head out!
[SHOYO] (startled)

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,136
So anyway, what do you think
the first‐years we're gonna
be up against are like?

168
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:27,671
They can't be tougher
than the upperclassmen.

169
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:32,510
It makes no difference to me how
skilled they are... We'll defeat
them no matter what they'e like.

170
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,446
you're right; that's exactly
what I was gonna say!

171
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:36,881
(taken aback) Tch.

172
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:38,182
don't you "tch" me!...

173
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:41,719
One more time!
(smacked, fall over)

174
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,524
[TOBIO]
You've got to learn to stop
receiving with your face!

175
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:49,828
I can't put my finger on it,
but there's something I don't
like about those rookies.

176
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:53,464
But you never like anybody when
you first meet them, Tanaka...

177
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:56,500
It's you... you're
just a paranoid guy.

178
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,036
I don't like
your tone...

179
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:00,338
They're a bit further along
than I expected they'd be...

180
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:02,841
you think Saturday's
game will be okay?

181
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:08,212
[RYUNOSUKE]
(surprised) Are you kiddin'‐
Of course it will! They've got
Yours Truly on their side!

182
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,815
Well, at least
Kageyama's good.
(hurt)

183
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:15,019
[KOSHI]
You know, I think he's actually
calmed down a bit since middle
school. That's positive.

184
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:18,156
[RYUNOSUKE]
What?! No way, he's
a snotty little shit!

185
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:21,793
[KOSHI]
Well, he seemed to have absolute
confidence in himself back
then...

186
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:26,630
Maybe over confident.
He's a lot less brazen
now, don't you think?

187
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,867
[RYUNOSUKE]
Okay, but he's still
a little shit.

188
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:33,204
[KOSHI]
Oh, right, my bad... Maybe
you're not the best person
to ask about that.

189
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:37,308
[RYUNOSUKE]
Uh... hey...
That's not cool...

190
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:41,112
[SHOYO]
(slide) (panting)

191
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:43,081
(catch)

192
00:11:43,982 --> 00:11:47,351
[SHOYO]
Okay... One more try!

193
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:48,987
[TOBIO] You ready?

194
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:50,354
[SHOYO]
Yeah!

195
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:52,924
[TOBIO]
(startled) Behind you!

196
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:55,994
[SHOYO]
Gotcha! (confused)

197
00:11:56,094 --> 00:12:00,664
[KEI]
Are you guys seriously
practicing out here?

198
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:03,501
You must be the first‐years
who made all that trouble on
the first day.

199
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:06,170
[TADASHI]
T‐shirts, out here?
Aren't you cold?

200
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,239
[SHOYO, internal]
Whoa, they'e tall!

201
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,974
[SHOYO]
Give it back! Hey!

202
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:12,676
[KEI]
Shouldn't you elementary
schoolers be home at this hour?

203
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:16,514
[SHOYO]
(irritated) Who are you
s'posed to be?! (look)

204
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:18,682
[TOBIO]
I guess you're the other
new first‐year players.

205
00:12:18,783 --> 00:12:20,051
[KEI] Hm?
[SHOYO] Huh? Quiet!

206
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:21,886
[TOBIO, internal]
Interesting.

207
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:24,188
[SHOYO] I'll do
the talking! Hey!
[TOBIO] Question..
How tall are you?

208
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:26,991
Glad you asked! Tsukki here
happens to be six‐two!

209
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:28,492
He's almost six foot three!

210
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:30,328
[SHOYO]
(surprised) Six foot two?!

211
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:32,797
What's the point of you bragging
about how tall I am, Tadashi?

212
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:34,765
you're right,
sorry, Tsukki.

213
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,736
You're Kageyama from
Kitagawa First, aren't you?

214
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:42,440
[TOBIO] Tch.
[KEI] A star player like you at
a school like this...

215
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,374
[TOBIO] So?

216
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:45,309
[SHOYO] Look, pal!
[KEI TOBIO] Hm?

217
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:48,546
We're not gonna lose to you,
do you understand me?!

218
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:52,716
(seething)

219
00:12:54,953 --> 00:12:57,088
[KEI] Isn't that cute?
(SHOYO confused)

220
00:12:57,188 --> 00:13:00,758
[KEI]
I didn't realize that little
skirmish actually meant
something to you...

221
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:02,626
We couldn't care less about it.

222
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:05,196
[SHOYO] Huh?
[KEI] we're not concerned with
winning or losing,

223
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:07,799
but if it's that important
to you two...

224
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,201
Maybe... we'll just
throw the game.

225
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,003
You mean WHAAAAT?!

226
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:15,439
Fine... I don't care if you
throw it or work yourselves
to death...

227
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:17,842
cause I'm still going
to win on Saturday.

228
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,210
You mean "we" right?!

229
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,379
(laughter) So confident!

230
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,181
Well that's the
King for you!

231
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:24,382
[SHOYO] (OM startled)
(OM nervous)

232
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:26,450
Hey... don't call me that.

233
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,586
[TOBIO] (grunt) Huh?!
[KEI] Ha, I knew it.

234
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:32,023
Rumor has it you lose your
cool every time someone
brings up your old nickname.

235
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:37,595
[KEI]
But who wouldn't want to be King
of the Court? I mean it really
suits you, Your Highness!

236
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:40,164
[TOBIO] (seething)
[SHOYO, internal]
Your funeral, dude.

237
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:42,300
[TOBIO]
What is your problem?

238
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:52,043
[KEI] I saw you, you know?
At the finals.
[TOBIO] (surprised)
[SHOYO] Hm?

239
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:56,647
I still can't believe your
teammates put up with all
those selfish sets you used
to toss up...

240
00:13:56,747 --> 00:13:58,716
I know I wouldn't. Oh!

241
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:03,221
[KEI] So that's why you're
here! I bet they finally
got sick of you.
[TOBIO] (breath)

242
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:05,089
[TOBIO]
(angry) (grab)

243
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:06,791
[KEI] (grabbed)
[SHOYO] (gasp)

244
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:07,792
[TADASHI]
(gasp) Tsukki!

245
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:09,660
(quiet anger)

246
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,262
Hmph.

247
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:16,935
[SHOYO, internal]
What the? I don't really
understand what's going on,

248
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:20,571
but it's not like him to not
just say anything back to these
jerks!

249
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,843
[SHOYO, internal]
Come on, Kageyama, get the last
word as you walk away like you
always do!

250
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:25,977
[TOBIO]
We're leaving.

251
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:28,179
(stunned) What?! Wait!

252
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,884
[KEI] Running off?... Guess the
King's not a threat after all.
[SHOYO] (glare)

253
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:36,554
[KEI]
I hope His Majesty puts up more
of a fight on Saturday.

254
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:40,158
[KEI]
(shocked)

255
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:42,726
Would you just shut up
about the stupid King?!

256
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:44,628
I'm here too!

257
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:47,298
[SHOYO]
You have no idea what
I'm capable of!

258
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:49,700
[KEI] Oh yeah?
[SHOYO] (startled)

259
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:53,504
What's that look for anyways,
buddy?! Are you trying to
start something with me?!

260
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:57,708
(sigh) There's no need
to argue, alright?

261
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,444
Let's all just enjoy playing
some volleyball together.

262
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,313
[KEI]
It's just a game, right?

263
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,748
[SHOYO] (gasp)
What's that supposed to mean?!

264
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:07,952
[KEI]
Exactly what it
sounds like. Bye.

265
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:09,353
[SHOYO]
Hey, not so fast!

266
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:11,689
[SHOYO]
You never told me who you are!

267
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,392
[KEI]
I'm Kei Tsukishima,
Year 1 Class 4.

268
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:16,327
[TADASHI]
I'm Tadashi Yamaguchi.

269
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:19,230
[KEI]
As of today, we're officially
your new teammates...

270
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:24,535
Even if doesn't feel like it...
anyway, I looking forward to His
Majesty's royal sets.

271
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:26,404
[TADASHI]
See ya!

272
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:31,342
What is their deal? Those two
are some major league butt wads.

273
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:33,577
We should show those
pukes who's boss!

274
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:35,013
[TOBIO]
That goes without saying.

275
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:37,681
[SHOYO]
(annoyed) Hey, where ya going?

276
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:38,682
[TOBIO] Huh?

277
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:41,419
We still got some work
to do, don't we?

278
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:44,622
(unsure) (determined)

279
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:47,591
[TADASHI]
Hey Tsukki, wait up!
Is something wrong?

280
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:52,463
I hate guys like that...
Always trying a little
bit too hard.

281
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:55,733
[KEI]
They'e both a touch
over‐zealous for my taste.

282
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:05,776
[TOBIO] Focus! You have
to brace faster than that!
[KOSHI] How late are they
planning to practice?

283
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:11,349
[SHOYO] I know that!
[RYUNOSUKE] Eh, who even knows
with these two knuckleheads...
All I know is I'm sleepy.

284
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:12,917
[KOSHI]
(troubled)

285
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:18,790
Your Majesty.

286
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,991
(angry)

287
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:22,160
(startled) Ggh!

288
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,097
Quit it, Kageyama! It's
too dark to see out here;
don't hit it so hard!

289
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:28,132
[TOBIO] (heavy breathing)

290
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:29,567
[TOBIO]
Sorry.

291
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,470
(scared, into stumble)

292
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,739
[SHOYO, internal] He doesn't
look sorry at all. What's gotten
into him all of a sudden?

293
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,344
[TOBIO] (heavy breathing)
[SHOYO, internal] He's been
extra tense since we ran into
that tall guy.

294
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:43,747
[SHOYO, internal]
But I can't really spike if he
won't send me anymore sets.

295
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:48,252
I guess I'l just do my best
at receiving until he decides
to do one.

296
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:50,721
[SHOYO]
Hey! Try another one of those!

297
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:53,524
♪♪♪

298
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:29,320
[TOBIO, internal] (gasp)
That's new. He couldn't handle
a ball at that speed before!

299
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,222
Okay! Now no holding back!

300
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:33,324
[TOBIO]
(focus) Fine by me!

301
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:35,426
(hit, stumble) (grunt)

302
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:37,996
[RYUNOSUKE]
Whoops, overslept!

303
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:41,432
I'm so late, I'm so late, the
boss is gonna murder me!

304
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:45,369
[RYUNOSUKE, distant rap]
Kiyoko made me breakfast,
so I couldn't leave the house!

305
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:50,174
[RYUNOSUKE] (chuckles)
Yeah I wish... hm, huh?

306
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:51,976
(impact, hop up)

307
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:53,812
(grunt)

308
00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:55,613
(impact, hop up)

309
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:59,650
Damn, how long have they been
back and forth like that?

310
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,553
Well, I got here
15 minutes ago, so...

311
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:04,088
It's been non‐stop?!
(shocked)

312
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:05,356
[KOSHI] (nod)
[RYUNOSUKE] Wow.

313
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:06,925
(hit, stumble)

314
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:09,193
[TOBIO, internal]
He makes up for his bad
technique

315
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:11,729
with raw athleticism, but...

316
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,431
[TOBIO]
Everybody has their limit!

317
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:14,866
[SHOYO] (small exert)

318
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:16,634
[TOBIO] Let's take a
break for‐ Uh?
[SHOYO] Not yet!

319
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:19,770
[SHOYO]
No! It hasn't hit the floor!

320
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:21,472
[TOBIO] Okay, Fine!
[SHOYO] (look)

321
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:23,307
[RYUNOSUKE]
That's brutal! Can he hit that?

322
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,043
[TOBIO, internal]
Damn, force of habit.

323
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:28,646
[KOSHI]
Hinata's had amazing athletic
ability since middle school.

324
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:30,281
[SHOYO] (run)
[RYUNOSUKE] Huh?

325
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:32,450
[KOSHI]
But... besides all of that...

326
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,954
He's got this... insane
thirst for victory that
keeps him going.

327
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:43,161
[TOBIO, internal]
His weapon isn't physical
prowess and it's definitely not
size... It's something else...

328
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:45,997
[TOBIO, internal]
It's that every time the going
gets tough...

329
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:50,468
He has just enough left in him
to take it one step further!

330
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:56,174
[SHOYO]
(grunt) (exert)

331
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:58,910
[KOSHI] (gasp)
[RYUNOSUKE] He did it!

332
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,012
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice one, Little man!

333
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:04,615
[TOBIO, flashback]
I'll set to whoever
I have to to win...

334
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:09,153
It's just... I highly doubt that
person is going to be you.

335
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:14,158
[SHOYO]
I don't ever want to lose again!

336
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,030
But it's... not over yet.

337
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,933
Huh?

338
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:25,636
[RYUNOSUKE]
Here we go!

339
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:27,171
There it is! He
finally set him one!

340
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:29,073
[SHOYO] (grunt) (panting)
[RYUNOSUKE] Too bad.

341
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:32,176
There's no way he's got enough
strength left to spike it down.

342
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:34,813
(happy)

343
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:37,916
(spike)

344
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,154
(happy)

345
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:46,024
I gotta hand it to him,
the kid can jump.

346
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:47,959
Can't believe he
managed to hit that.

347
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,195
[SHOYO] (happy)
[RYUNOSUKE] Check out the
stupid look on his face.

348
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:54,632
So I guess getting a set
must be really important
to the guy, huh?

349
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:56,034
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh?

350
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:58,803
I made a lot of friends
along the way...

351
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:01,806
But none of those people could
ever become my real teammates.

352
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:07,879
[SHOYO] (coughing) (pant)
[KOSHI] I suppose getting tosses
from the setter was just
something we taken for granted.

353
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:10,114
[TOBIO] Hey.
[SHOYO] Huh?

354
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:13,852
[TOBIO]
Tomorrow... we'll win.

355
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:14,919
(determined)

356
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:19,057
He's no longer your most
powerful enemy...

357
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:21,525
[SHOYO, internal]
Now he's my most powerful ally.

358
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,295
(awkward) Hmph.

359
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:29,968
(annoyed) Yeah? Tell me
something I DON'T know!
(sudden nausea)

360
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:31,069
[SHOYO] (puke)

361
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:33,137
[RYUNOSUKE] Ugh, that's sick!
(freaking out)

362
00:21:33,237 --> 00:21:36,207
[KOSHI] Tanaka, get some
water! Oh god... and a bucket!

363
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:38,276
A‐and some towels...

364
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:49,487
(heavy running)

365
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:50,421
[TOBIO]
(shocked)

366
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:53,157
[SHOYO]
(battle cry)

367
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:57,195
[TOBIO] (angry)
Quit running, you little moron!

368
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:58,963
[TOBIO SHOYO]
(panting)

369
00:21:59,063 --> 00:22:02,433
Why are you dorks wasting
precious energy right before
a game?

370
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,768
You should take
a breather, idiots.

371
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:07,872
[SHOYO]
Man... we tied... (panting)

372
00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:12,176
[TOBIO, panting]
I can'... let you.. beat me...

373
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:13,611
[SHOYO] Back atcha...

374
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:16,214
[SHOYO]
(heavy breathing)

375
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:19,483
[SHOYO, internal]
This guy really gets
on my nerves...

376
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,885
(pant)

377
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:29,693
[SHOYO, internal]
He's gonna start sending
the ball my way now...
Sets from a real setter!

378
00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:31,429
[SHOYO]
You ready to win this or what?

379
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:33,197
(surprised)

380
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,068
[TOBIO]
We need to go and get set up.

381
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:38,236
Yeah.

382
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,570
[KEI]
Morning, my liege!

383
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,139
(surprised)

384
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:44,775
(pissed)

385
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:47,078
[SHOYO, internal]
This time...

386
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:50,414
I'll break through
any wall they put up!

387
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:26,978
[TADASHI]
Kageyama's such a whimp.
He didn't even stand up for
himself.

388
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:29,313
[KEI] Shut it, Tadashi.
[TADASHI] Sorry.

389
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:32,817
[KEI]
It's time to see what the King's
made of. And the shorty too.

390
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:37,155
[SHOYO]
Grr! Next Haikyu!
"The View from the Summit!"

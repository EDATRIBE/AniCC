1
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,733
[Daichi]:
Chance ball!

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,333
Aw, yeah!

3
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,000
That's it, buddy!
Nice job!

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,100
Alright,
nice kill!

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,666
[Ryunosuke]:
You're up, Tsukki! Go for it!

6
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:21,433
You know, if they keep
this back‐and‐forth momentum

7
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,533
going like it is for
a little while longer,

8
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:26,500
then I'm thinking Karasuno'll
probably take the first set.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,066
But for them to
get a solid lead...

10
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,133
There you go!
Oh man, nice one‐touch!

11
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,633
Counter! Now!

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,233
[Yu]:
Chance ball!

13
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,633
C quick? Not today!

14
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:42,700
Whoa... That's two blockers on
Hinata's and Kageyama's attack.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,100
Guess this is a first
for us, isn't it?

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,133
I can't say I like it.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,666
No way... It's come down to set
point for us against Date Tech?

18
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,100
Hey! Not too bad!

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,633
Karasuno is totally
crushing it!

20
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:41,233
[Shoyo]:
Give it here!

21
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,166
Yeah!

22
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:03,466
Whoa! Karasuno
just won the set.

23
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:06,833
So Karasuno's a real threat once
they get in the groove...

24
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,800
You don't think they'll be able
to snap up the second set, too,

25
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,200
do you?

26
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,166
Hmm... I can't say for certain,
but I know we won't see the same
[Mizoguchi]:
Look alive, Kunimi! We don't

27
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:17,666
developments that
we saw in set one.

28
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:21,466
[Irihata]:
Date Tech, specifically that
massive number 7 fellow,
Man, that was close...

29
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,133
is still reeling
from the shock

30
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:26,033
of Karasuno's
special quick attack.

31
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:28,200
That really tall
number 7 guy...

32
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,233
and their number 6 down
there at the end...

33
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,500
both of them were able
to actually get a hand

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,566
on the combo attack.

35
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,166
Yeah, they're
pretty tough, huh?

36
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,133
The best thing we have
going for us right now

37
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,233
is our dynamic duo
and that move of theirs.

38
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:45,200
We can't have it put in a box
like when we played Nekoma.

39
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,533
For the second set,

40
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,200
we're gonna begin the rotation
two places ahead.

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,133
In set one...

42
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,100
[Keishin]:
Hinata was matched up with
No‐Brows Number 7,

43
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,966
so I think it's better
to avoid that this time.

44
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:01,200
That's why we'll start
two positions up.

45
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,000
[Takeda]:
That makes sense.

46
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,500
That way, Number 7 won't
be able to mark Hinata

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,866
as closely as he
did the first time.

48
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:10,733
Smart thinking, Coach!

49
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,500
Obviously, he's not going
to be completely unmarked...

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,066
All this will do keep the two
of them separated... Besides...

51
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,133
If Hinata's LESS
marked during this game,

52
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:22,466
then it stands to reason
that the rest of you are gonna

53
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:24,266
be covered even more.

54
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:27,200
[Asahi]:
We can't always
just lean on Hinata.

55
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,633
Keeping him in constant play,
keeps US open...

56
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:35,000
As ace... I promise
I'll do what it takes.

57
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,800
That sounded
so badass!

58
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,766
He's growing up
before our eyes.

59
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:41,300
Thanks, DAD...

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,633
Me too!

61
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,166
Well...

62
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:47,600
I uh... I can't really do back
attacks like you can, Asahi,

63
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,333
so... I'll make as many points
as I can from the front!

64
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:54,533
[Hinata]:
And I'll be the greatest
decoy you've ever seen!

65
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,700
Good. Thank you...

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,100
You can definitely
count on me!

67
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,300
Sure!

68
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,433
Go, go, Date Tech,
Date Tech, here we go!

69
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,733
It's time to start set two.

70
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,666
I'm sorry about that,
Tsukishima...

71
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:15,166
With the new matchups,

72
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:17,900
you'll be opposite
their number 7 a whole lot.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,266
It's alright...

74
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:21,400
I mean, c'mon let's be
honest about this...

75
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,833
Nobody's expecting me to
score the game‐winning point

76
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,433
on that guy, you know?

77
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,200
It's Hinata's job to deal out
the real damage...

78
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,866
[Kei]:
Think about it.

79
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,066
From my position, all I'm
supposed to be responsible for

80
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,533
is holding down the fort
the best I can...

81
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,533
It's no different than
any other game, really.

82
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,800
And face it, putting
all that aside...

83
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,233
it's pretty clear that
their blockers have already

84
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,466
locked onto YOU, anyway.

85
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:49,100
[Daichi]:
Alright, let's go!

86
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,766
[Moniwa]:
Nice receive!
Looks like Karasuno
switched up the rotation...

87
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,266
And I think
I know why.

88
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:57,433
It's to try and keep Aone
away from their Number 10.

89
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,300
Listen, no matter
what the matchup is...

90
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,333
we need to focus on
shutting that spiker down.

91
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,900
Listen Aone, I know we have
a tendency to be snotty

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,466
when we're out of uniform...
but while we're on the court,

93
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:13,733
we should be
good underclassmen.

94
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,466
[Daichi]:
Kageyama!

95
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:28,333
Hinata had him on the hook,
but then he went left.

96
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,500
[Daichi]:
Yeah, Tanaka!

97
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,633
Nice one!

98
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,600
I'm open!

99
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,233
Watch number 3!

100
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,066
That only happened because Date
Tech was specifically focusing

101
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,966
on the guy with the man‐bun.

102
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,766
He won't be able to do that with
the receives all over the place.

103
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,566
Leave that to short stuff.

104
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,800
Nice, Aone!

105
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,533
Yeah!.. Let's do
that again next time!

106
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,500
Great job, Daichi!

107
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:03,000
[Team Date Tech]:
(cheering)

108
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,333
[Spiky‐haired Guy]:
Karasuno Number 10's
in the front row now.
Okay, bring it on!

109
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,933
[Ryonosuke]:
There it goes!
Cover it, Kageyama!

110
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,633
[Shoyo]:
Bring it here!

111
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,133
I don't believe it,
he's even faster

112
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:21,233
when he's right in front
of you. He's a monster!

113
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:32,166
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

114
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:34,533
[Mizoguchi]:
After they changed
the rotation...

115
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,566
it kind of seemed like
it brought in new life

116
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,333
into that special technique
of theirs somehow, didn't it?

117
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:42,733
Whatever effect it had
will wear off as time goes by...

118
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,300
If Date wins this set..

119
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,600
and manages to keep the same
momentum into a third set...

120
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,833
[Irihata]:
Karasuno loses the advantage...

121
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,666
It's all gonna depend on how
well they can hold their own

122
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:55,533
against Date Tech's number 7
without their number 10

123
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:56,933
on the front row.

124
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:59,266
Whether or not they can
beat the iron wall,

125
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:03,700
comes down to how much they rely
on that little decoy of theirs.

126
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,966
[Daichi]:
All yours, Hinata!

127
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:09,933
Everyone's talking about that
number 10's quick attack!

128
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,166
Which guy?

129
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:12,900
He's in the
back row right now.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,633
[Moniwa]:
Great work, guys!

131
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,033
Tsukishima. I've been thinking
about what you were saying

132
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,366
before the game started...

133
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,466
about how it's your job
to hold down the fort

134
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,600
while Hinata's
in the front row...

135
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,566
Pulling that off against
a team as tough as this...

136
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,500
that's really
impressive.

137
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,866
The way things are,

138
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,233
those two aren't just
important to our offense...

139
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,933
they're fundamental players.

140
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,600
But we have to
survive the moments

141
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,533
when we can't use their
attack... That's crucial.

142
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:40,966
[Asahi]:
It's like when you receive,
to set up a spike,

143
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,866
even if you can't
make the hit yourself.

144
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,566
Right now...

145
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,300
whether or not we hold down the
fort... that decides our fate.

146
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,566
Cover me, would ya?

147
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,100
[Tobio]:
Got it!

148
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,900
When the going gets tough,
the ace gets the set.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,600
Open!

150
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,333
Asahi!

151
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:03,900
[Moniwa]:
Watch the left!

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,133
[Asahi]:
All the walls in the world...

153
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:11,033
...won't stop me!

154
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:17,266
AAAAAAAAH!

155
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,966
I can see why they're
so famous for blocking.

156
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:25,300
[Spectator 3]:
Number 10 is just
the middle blocker,
Try again, Asahi!

157
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,833
but he seems
like the ace.
Don't let it
get to you!

158
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:33,100
[Irihata]:
Number 7's block is the driving
force behind the iron wall.

159
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,400
They need him in the front row
quick or they're in trouble.

160
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,233
[Moniwa]:
Let's keep it up!

161
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,133
[Team Date Tech]:
Yeah!

162
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:43,533
[Irihata]:
How much more can you take...
ace of Karasuno?

163
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,633
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice receive, boss!

164
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,733
[Tobio]:
Open!

165
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,166
[Moniwa]:
Number Three!

166
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,066
You won't break me again!

167
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,700
[Moniwa]:
One touch!

168
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,766
Counter!

169
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,366
Hey... don't be getting cocky!

170
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,666
[Takeda]:
We've got our own wall!

171
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,800
Those guys just shut down
a quick attack!

172
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,100
That was a great block!
[Black‐haired Guy]:
So it looks like
Number 3 and Number 11

173
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
are the tallest guys
on Karasuno's team.

174
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,900
Yeah! That's
a block point!

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,400
Sweet!

176
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,300
And now, if Date Tech
gets the next point...

177
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,033
[Takinoue]:
Number 7 moves
back to the rear!

178
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,533
[Moniwa]:
Shake it off!

179
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:25,633
You ready?

180
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,666
Okay!

181
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:29,366
Now let's widen the gap!

182
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:32,933
[Ryunosuke]:
Booyah!
Uh‐oh, Karasuno number
10's in the front now!

183
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,666
Let's go!

184
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,633
Just six
more points...

185
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:39,100
Wreck 'em as much as you
can while you're up front,

186
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,533
little man!

187
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,233
[Yu]:
Number 12!

188
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,366
[Ryunosuke]:
Kageyama! Cover it!

189
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,066
Here!

190
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,533
Bring it to me!

191
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,100
He's really
something, huh?

192
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,833
He just goes running straight
in for a quick attack

193
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:58,333
where you'd normally
use the left side guy.

194
00:10:58,433 --> 00:10:59,566
Bam!

195
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,966
YEAH! That'll cut
you down to size!

196
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,666
[Sasaya]:
Nice, Kamacchi!

197
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,433
[Takeda]:
Agh! We can't get
a solid lead!

198
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:13,000
Just be patient...
We'll get there.

199
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,233
Nice one, Asahi!

200
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,466
That's a chance ball!

201
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:18,100
Give it here!

202
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,600
Dammit‐!

203
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,333
Awesome kill!

204
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:26,400
Keep going!

205
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,300
Just one more point
to match point!

206
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,933
You're so
close, guys!

207
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,533
Nice receive!

208
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:35,866
Perfect... That giant Date Tech
blocker's in the back, now...

209
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:38,900
and Shorty's still
positioned in the front...

210
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,566
Now they can
widen the lead!

211
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,366
Kamasaki...

212
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:45,566
You hiding behind Aone
to let him get all the glory

213
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,333
or do you want him
to carry you?

214
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,766
Huh?!

215
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:51,400
Screw you, dude!... Takes more
than him to make the iron wall!

216
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:54,600
Got that?!

217
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,133
Yeah!

218
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:01,433
Try again.

219
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,200
Yeah.

220
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,733
[Takeda]:
Number 7's coming back
to the front row.

221
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,300
[Keishin]:
We're good.

222
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,766
We've still got
our freak quick‐attack.

223
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,600
But...

224
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,100
[Daichi]:
Nishinoya!

225
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
[Shoyo]:
Bring it on!

226
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,266
Waterfall ball...
Close one.

227
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah, but it's
still match point!

228
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,400
Go for the point!

229
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,433
Alright!

230
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:39,266
Hey, Don't you sweat it, Aone,
we're just getting started...

231
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,600
You can stop
the next one!

232
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:46,066
It's match point
for Karasuno now.

233
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,733
[Spectator 2]:
Their number 10's
on the back row now.

234
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:53,466
[Keishin]:
This is gonna be their strongest
turn for blocking us.

235
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,166
[Ryunosuke]:
Serve's up!

236
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:03,033
[Moniwa]:
Good call!
It's fine...
I'm sorry, you guys,

237
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,600
You are such a
clumsy little moron!
It happens to everybody; all you
can do is regret it for a second

238
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,766
You're not helpin'!
and then let it go!

239
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:09,533
Sir!

240
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:12,033
[Spiky‐haired Guy]:
If Date Tech gets two more
points, it'll be deuce.

241
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,933
And with this rotation,
that could very easily happen.

242
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:18,133
Yeah, well, Karasuno better hope
that doesn't happen right now,

243
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,933
what with Number 10
being out and everything.

244
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,566
Shake it off!
You're good!

245
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,300
Man, their number
7's intimidating.

246
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,433
Yeah...

247
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:28,433
I could've sworn he had
that one... But hey...

248
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,066
[Shoyo]:
he's gonna have
a real hard time
Alright, here goes!

249
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,300
with Asahi in the
front row, right?

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,400
Asahi!

251
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,100
Asahi...

252
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,066
Our ace is
out there... It's okay!

253
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,100
[Tobio]:
Right here!

254
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,900
[Daichi]:
Watch for that quick!
This is a good
arrangement,

255
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,400
but Date's watching
extra close now.

256
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:08,600
Asahi, here!
Cover!

257
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,166
Got it!

258
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm no ace if I can't make
the last ball count!

259
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,666
We shut this guy down once;
so if we can't do it again,

260
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:18,733
then we have no right to say
we're the Iron Wall!

261
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,033
[Sakunami]:
Nice block, Moniwa!

262
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,133
Crap! The back's
wide open!

263
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,600
[Spectator 3]:
He got it!

264
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,266
Hey, cover!

265
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,800
Every ball is an opportunity!

266
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,766
Left side! One more!

267
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,500
Asahi!

268
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,733
[Takinoue]:
That's a little
close to the net?!

269
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:43,333
[Shimada]:
A joust!

270
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,233
[Takinoue]:
Let's see who's
got the strength!

271
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,633
I can't make it...

272
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,766
(crowd roaring cheers)
[Spectator 3]:
His foot?!

273
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:16,466
No way...

274
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:17,566
Did he just...?!

275
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,000
One more time!

276
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,200
Yeah, nice follow‐through!

277
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,000
[Asahi]:
Get back... get back, NOW!

278
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,966
Get a running start and
jump as high as you can!

279
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,233
Keep doing it as many times
as you have to,

280
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,000
just make
this count!

281
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,400
Stay focused and don't stop
moving!

282
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,933
If you stop wanting it
for even a second,

283
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,900
the ball's gonna
hit the floor!

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,533
[Yu]:
Kageyama, cover!

285
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:40,666
On it!

286
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:42,400
[Koshi]:
One more time!

287
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,700
One more time!

288
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,600
Until I can score!

289
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,066
Asahi's favorite toss is
slightly in front of the net.

290
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,166
A medium‐high set.

291
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,666
Uh‐oh...

292
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:57,766
Why would
he do that?!

293
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,433
It's fine.

294
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:03,266
This is the best chance
we have... Trust me.

295
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,600
Yeah, do it, Asahi!

296
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,000
Clear that wall!

297
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,933
Do it!
Gooooo!

298
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,333
GOOOO!

299
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,633
GOOOO!

300
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,200
(final whistle)

301
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,966
YEAAAAAAAAH!

302
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:04,433
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

303
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,866
Oh, yeah!
Got 'em!

304
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:10,133
I knew you guys could win!

305
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:12,266
Let's line up, guys.

306
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,933
[Date Tech/Karasuno]:
Thank you for the game!

307
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:19,066
(applause)

308
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:37,966
[Yu]:
You did it, Asahi!

309
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:39,300
That was nuts!

310
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,933
First Date's block
was like BAM!

311
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:43,933
And then, they
were all wuwuwuwu!

312
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:45,900
If it was me,
I'd go FWOOSH!

313
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,100
Use your
words, Hinata.

314
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,300
If I'm this team's ace...

315
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,600
[Asahi]:
you guys are
the heroes.

316
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,466
Heroes!

317
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:01,400
Oh yeah, I like
the sound of that!

318
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,566
Look, despite that insane
quick attack of theirs,

319
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,433
you did really good out there
today, Aone... They just‐

320
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,000
Nationals!

321
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,433
He is right, Moniwa!

322
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,166
We are just gonna have
to get our revenge

323
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:16,966
in the spring
preliminaries!

324
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,766
[Futakuchi]:
Prelims are in September, so
let's head home, make a plan,

325
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,100
and get ready to crush Karasuno
if we get matched with them

326
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,500
at Nationals‐

327
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,100
But the third‐years will
be long gone by then.

328
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,600
Oh I get it,

329
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,000
so you don't think we're worth
waiting around for, huh?!

330
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,200
Huh?! What are
you talking about?!

331
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,700
We've discussed
this before, you two!

332
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,700
Third‐years are done
after Inter‐High!

333
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,433
Yeah, but...

334
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:42,600
[Moniwa]:
You guys will
be fine.

335
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,533
[Moniwa]:
Our school's known for being
a serious contender...

336
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:47,533
but that excludes
us third‐years.

337
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:50,700
Let's face it, we're
the chaff of the team.

338
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,233
It's only thanks to you guys
that we've been able to keep up

339
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,133
our reputation as
the Iron Wall.

340
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:01,200
When Nationals come next year...
you have to stay!

341
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,200
Start preparing for it right
now with a brand new team...

342
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,766
and if you can't win
this year, win next year!

343
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:10,333
Whether it's Seijoh or Karasuno
or Shiratorizawa...

344
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:13,700
take down everyone in your path
and make it to Nationals!

345
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,733
But...

346
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,266
Understand?!

347
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,400
Sir...

348
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,000
Hey, you need to
speak up, Futakuchi!

349
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:27,433
Sir!

350
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,166
[Yui]:
Great work out
there, you three!

351
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,933
Congratulations!

352
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,433
Oh, hey there...

353
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,400
I didn't know you ladies came
out to support us, thanks.

354
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,733
You honestly had no
idea they were here?

355
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,933
There's our girl!

356
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:43,366
Glad you got
your revenge.

357
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,966
Right! And we'll
win again!

358
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,733
[Takeda]:
Um, hey Coach?

359
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,700
Hm?

360
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,166
That last set...

361
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:58,033
What exactly did you mean
when you said that

362
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:00,166
it was our best one?

363
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,166
Well when the
receives are crazy

364
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:04,233
and you can't do the kind
of attack you want to do...

365
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,266
the last ball
ends up left...

366
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:09,533
It'll always go to the position
where the ace is waiting.

367
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:12,666
[Keishin]:
In a critical moment like that,
I wanted Asahi to see

368
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:15,400
how it feels to rip a
point out of that Iron Wall

369
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,200
Thank you for coming!
with his own
two hands.

370
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,200
[Takeda]:
Oh, I see.

371
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm sure it boosts his
confidence for the next play.

372
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,800
Well, I heard something about
Asahi getting his man‐bun

373
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,300
in a bunch after Date Tech
handed his ass to him.

374
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,766
But I think this
helped him get over it.

375
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:34,066
He really held his own
against that Iron Wall,

376
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,033
with or without
a decoy.

377
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:39,366
[Keishin]:
Besides... for a spiker, there's
a certain amount of pride

378
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:43,266
to be taken in having
the ball sent to him.

379
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,366
It's proof of how much
your setter trusts you

380
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:47,900
when all the chips
are down.

381
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,800
In his case, he's got TWO
setters who believe in him...

382
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,366
so how could he
NOT be confident?

383
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:01,466
I've never seen a block as
intimidating as Date Tech's.

384
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:03,433
Me neither...

385
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:06,466
So have you figured out how
the two Karasuno first‐years

386
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,500
have been able to differentiate
between their normal

387
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,466
and their
super‐quick attacks?

388
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:13,166
[Shimada]:
I couldn't make out
any signals during the rally...

389
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:15,633
[Takinoue]:
Yeah.

390
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,066
That's good... They couldn't
read our signals!

391
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,900
Uh‐huh... I guess we
should keep 'em then.

392
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Couple of lunkheads like you
managed to put it all together;

393
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,500
I must say,
I'm impressed.

394
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,133
For your information,
it wasn't us!

395
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:32,966
Of course not... So
who did it for you then?

396
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,066
[Shoyo]:
Sugawara.

397
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:40,100
Congratulations, Captain.
You got your revenge.

398
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,900
Yeah.

399
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,966
Even so...

400
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:47,500
I would have preferred to
beat them with MY sets though.

401
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:54,533
Ah! I‐I'm sorry! Uh...
Let's just keep that between us.

402
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:56,900
I'm glad
to hear it.

403
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,933
I'm glad you're still keeping
yourself involved with the game.

404
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,066
That's good.

405
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,133
Let's be ready to
win again tomorrow.

406
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:07,133
Yeah!

407
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,533
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Seijoh! Goooo, Seijoh, go!

408
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,100
Aoba‐Johsai won.

409
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,666
That's not good.

410
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,900
The King...

411
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,733
[Toru]:
and his little,
dark horse.

412
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,400
Once we chew you up and spit
you out, we can go on home.

413
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,233
We'll be at nationals.

414
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:08,000
[Ryunosuke]:
He thinks he's all that
just 'cause he has fangirls.

415
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,066
[Yu]:
Yeah, we've
still got Kiyoko‐

416
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,400
[Kiyoko]:
Hey Oikawa!

417
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,200
[Ryunosuke/Yu]:
What?! How could you?!

418
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,966
[Kiyoko]:
Kidding.

419
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:17,033
[Ryunosuke]:
Kiyoko...
[Yu]:
Don't scare us like that!

420
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:19,633
[Kiyoko]:
Next Haikyu!! "The Conductor."

1
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,741
[Ikejiri]:
Check it out!
I've got the pairings

2
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:09,276
for the Inter‐High
Preliminaries right here!

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,011
Cool!

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,178
Sweet!

5
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,914
[Chaya]:
So, who do we play first?

6
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:16,083
[Haga]:
Let me see...
Tori.. Torino?

7
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,785
[Chaya]:
Torino? That's
in England!

8
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,221
[Ikejiri]:
Try Italy. And you're
reading the kanji wrong.

9
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:21,556
[Chaya]:
Whatever, dude.

10
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:24,158
Oh!.. Karasuno,
I've heard of that school!

11
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,160
Uh... if I
remember right...

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,296
[Chaya]:
A lot of people call them
like, the "wingless crows."

13
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,432
[Haga]:
Wow, that's a
messed‐up nickname.

14
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,868
[Ikejiri]:
Their team used to be pretty
good though, right?

15
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:35,837
I think they went
to Nationals one time.

16
00:00:35,937 --> 00:00:37,939
[Chaya]:
Yeah, well, but apparently
they're nothing

17
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,341
to write home
about these days.

18
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,343
Hey, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

19
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,945
We might actually
win this game!

20
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,913
We'll get past the
first round for once!

21
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:49,050
Not if you don't get off your
butts and start practicing.

22
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,084
C‐Captain!

23
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,352
Now go run
some laps!

24
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,788
[Team Miyagi]:
Yes sir...

25
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:57,391
[Ikejiri]:
You know...

26
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,026
This guy I played volleyball
with back in middle school,

27
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,728
ended up going
to Karasuno High.

28
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:03,364
Oh yeah? Well, that ought
to be an interesting reunion...

29
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,133
You know, I don't think we've
ever played them before.

30
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,635
Yeah, that's right...

31
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,271
He said that he saw Karasuno
play in the Spring Nationals

32
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,507
on TV and couldn't get
the place out of his head...

33
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,909
But I'm sure living close
to the school had something

34
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,878
to do with his
decision too, though.

35
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:19,180
[Ikejiri]:
Wonder how he's doing?

36
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,551
[Ikejiri]:
Good old Daichi.

37
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,025
Don't just stand there,
follow through!

38
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,527
Get it
together!

39
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:33,227
I'm sorry!

40
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,662
Go after every ball...

41
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,799
as if it's the last the
last piece of meat on Earth!

42
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,502
Don't take a play off.

43
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,770
If you do, that'll be
the one you cry about

44
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,572
[Keishin]:
after the game's done!

45
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,276
First of all, you guys
did a great job

46
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,178
playing against
Nekoma today.

47
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,780
Next order
of business...

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,049
The Inter High Preliminaries
start next month,

49
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,718
June 2nd
to be exact.

50
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:59,954
There's no regional prelim here,
so it's straight to prefectural.

51
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,757
[Keishin]:
Out of 60‐some teams
in the prefecture,

52
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:05,359
only one gets to advance
to the nationals...

53
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,429
Lose one match and
that's all she wrote.

54
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,297
[Keishin]:
If you want revenge
against Nekoma,

55
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,700
you have to get
number 1 in Miyagi.

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,502
Second place won't do.

57
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,571
Well, that's assuming
they can prove themselves

58
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:19,340
as the greatest high
school team in all of Tokyo.

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,408
I guarantee you
they can do it, coach!

60
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,611
Yeah! They're
gonna make it!

61
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:28,182
I want... to
challenge Nekoma again.

62
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,151
One more time!

63
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,625
[Keishin]:
You're ain't done, Ginger!
On your feet!

64
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,994
[Shoyo]:
Yes sir! Keep
'em coming!

65
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:40,928
[Daichi]:
Front!

66
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:41,929
[Shoyo]:
Hiya!

67
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,297
[Koshi]:
Cover it!

68
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:52,807
[Yu]:
Dude, that's nuts!

69
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,442
It's like a whole page!

70
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:56,177
Right?!

71
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:58,245
Let me see.

72
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,715
Hey, what's the matter?
What are you guys
so excited about?

73
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:02,984
Look.

74
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:05,853
[Ryunosuke]:
That's Ushiwaka from
Shiratorizawa Academy.

75
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:08,122
They named him one of the
three players to watch

76
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,291
in this year's Nationals.

77
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,960
That's the school
Kageyama didn't get into!

78
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,961
WOULD YOU SHUT IT?!

79
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,296
(snickers)

80
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,430
[Tobio]:
What are you two
losers laughing at?!

81
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:17,799
So, who's Ushiwaka?

82
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:19,567
You seriously don't
know who that is?

83
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,969
Of course not; he only cares
about the Tiny Giant.

84
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,638
Ushiwaka is his nickname.

85
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:26,641
[Ryunosuke]:
His real name is
Wakatoshi Ushijima,

86
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,210
and he's the number one
ace in the prefecture.

87
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,045
Yeah, just look at him.

88
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,781
[Daichi]:
Now that is what an ace
is supposed to look like.

89
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,553
Whoa! H‐hey why's everyone
staring at me?!

90
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,287
Is Ushiwaka the reason
you wanted to go

91
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,056
to Shiratorizawa
Academy?

92
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:43,758
Let me guess,

93
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:45,627
you wanted to march right up
to that legendary ace and go...

94
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:49,030
"Move it, you clumsy dumbass!"
like you tell Hinata!

95
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,732
Of course not!

96
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:54,335
So we can't play Nekoma...
unless we defeat them first?

97
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,070
[Keishin]:
Remember, boys...

98
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,040
Shiratorizawa's not
the only good team.

99
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,609
[Koshi]:
They're the biggest threat
based on last year though.

100
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,778
Thank you for stating
the obvious...

101
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:06,681
but there's a whole lot more
than just them.

102
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:12,319
[Keishin]:
Wakutani South has
great defense and solidarity.

103
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:15,790
Date Tech's been called
the "iron wall"

104
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,960
because their team has higher
blocks than anyone else around.

105
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,762
They're big guys.

106
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,130
From what I understand, these
guys beat us two to nothing

107
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,669
in the public prefectural
tournament back in March.

108
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:31,939
Wait a minute. Why does
that sound familiar?

109
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:37,078
In one game... every single one
of Asahi's spikes was shut down.

110
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:39,647
[Tobio]:
Was that the game Sugawara
was telling us about

111
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,684
before Asahi decided to
come back to the team?

112
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,086
Date Tech's team has
been top‐four material

113
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,721
for a good
long while, but...

114
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,190
[Keishin]:
Last year, they only
ranked in the top 16

115
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,859
after losing in round 3
to Shiratorizawa,

116
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,294
who won first place.

117
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,798
That's why they're not
seeded this year.

118
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:58,733
So depending on how
the brackets are laid out,

119
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,169
we could end up having to face
them in the first round.

120
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,872
The next team is...
oh that's right...

121
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,141
I heard you guys played
a practice game with them

122
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,110
not long ago.

123
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,746
[Keishin]:
Their captain possesses the
most offensive power on the team

124
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:14,649
on top of being an
excellent setter...

125
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:18,485
He might even be the top overall
player in the whole prefecture.

126
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,990
Aoba Johsai,
led by Toru Oikawa.

127
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,459
Oh yeah, the
Great King!

128
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,196
[Keishin]:
They ranked in last
year's top four too.

129
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,566
Now last but
definitely not least...

130
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:38,339
...Shiratorizawa, headed up by
that famous ace, Ushiwaka.

131
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,841
That's the short version.

132
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,943
I'll give you more
detailed info later.

133
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:45,780
[Daichi/Koshi]:
Wow, Coach Ukai's
got his stuff together...

134
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,682
You two smartasses
wanna pay attention

135
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:50,785
or you wanna share your thoughts
with the class?

136
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:54,656
Anyway, those are the four teams
I think we need to look out for.

137
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:57,091
That said, if you spend too much
time staring at the top,

138
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,326
you'll get the rug pulled out
from under you.

139
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,829
[Keishin]:
Don't let yourselves make
the mistake of thinking

140
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,899
we're the only team who's there
to take the number one spot.

141
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,467
We're not.

142
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:08,903
Sure, we're going to
be training our asses off,

143
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:10,572
but remember all
those other teams

144
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,707
will be training
their asses off too...

145
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,777
No matter who won last year
and who lost, everybody's aiming

146
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:19,346
to win it all...
Never forget that.

147
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,616
One more thing.
Don't let those bastards

148
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:24,285
call us the wingless
crows EVER again!

149
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,087
Right!

150
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,055
You all are still in here?!

151
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:32,894
[Takeda]:
I'm so sorry I'm late, I got
stuck in a meeting. Anyway...

152
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:35,730
I've got the bracket
for the Preliminaries!

153
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:41,468
[Yu]:
If our team and Date Tech
both clear the first round,

154
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,038
we'll be up against them
in round two.

155
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:47,008
We shouldn't get ahead
of ourselves you guys.

156
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:50,778
[Kei]:
Aoba Johsai's seeded
in our block this year.

157
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,246
That's not good.

158
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:53,715
[Ryunosuke]:
Ugh... come on!

159
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:55,817
[Tobio/Shoyo]:
I don't like
those odds...

160
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,652
Hey...

161
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,887
Did you already
forget what I told you?

162
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,556
[Keishin]:
If you focus
on the top‐

163
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,525
Yes we know, sir.

164
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:10,798
[Ikejiri]:
Which school
did you pick?

165
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,366
[Daichi]:
Karasuno.

166
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,768
Which one is that?

167
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,870
You know, the one
from Spring Nationals.

168
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,771
Oh, nice.

169
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,640
So uh where are
you headed?

170
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,143
I chose to go to Tokonami...
Sorry about that.

171
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:23,244
It's cool.

172
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:24,746
[Ikejiri]:
I dunno, dude...

173
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:27,214
I guess if I keep playing
volleyball in high school...

174
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,883
[Daichi]:
You should!

175
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,852
[Ikejiri]:
Maybe we'll get to play
against each other.

176
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,954
But, hey, Make sure
you're ready for my team

177
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,089
to wipe the floor
with yours, alright?

178
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,563
(chuckles)

179
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:43,931
[Daichi]:
Go on and try it.

180
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:49,170
C'mon, pick up the pace, dude,
it's gettin' late!

181
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,175
[Daichi]:
We'll stay focused...
One game at a time!

182
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,460
Um, hey, Daichi!

183
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,863
Oh... Hey there,
Michimiya.

184
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,432
I just thought you might
want a copy of the program

185
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,568
for the pep rally...
Volleyball's 5th.

186
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:21,903
Thanks a lot.

187
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,605
So do you have a speech
prepared for it?

188
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:25,106
Eh, not really.

189
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:28,910
I can't believe the Inter High
tourney is so close.

190
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,445
I hear the boys are getting
super psyched for that!

191
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:32,980
What was the name
of that other school

192
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,216
you guys used to play
practice games wi‐?

193
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:36,217
Sorry.

194
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,552
Nekoma?

195
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:38,853
That's the one.. I heard
you played them again.

196
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:40,722
Yeah.. So how's
the girls' team?

197
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:42,690
Being in separate gyms keeps
us pretty much out of touch

198
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,526
with each
other.

199
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:46,928
Eh... Everything's about the
same as always.

200
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:50,364
I can't get a lot of the girls
to come to morning practice...

201
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:53,334
so I guess I'm not much
of a captain, huh?

202
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:57,805
Oh well, we'll probably lose
in the first round anyway.

203
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,674
Oops.

204
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:01,676
Michimiya... You told me
you were going to win

205
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:03,978
for sure
this time.

206
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:07,381
Remember...? It doesn't matter
how strong or talented

207
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:12,253
your opponent is.
You won't win unless you try.

208
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:14,722
O‐oh, I'm sorry!

209
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,891
I'm sure you didn't come here
for me to lecture you...

210
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,560
Sorry it's what I do.

211
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,962
(giggles)

212
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:24,198
It's funny, that's exactly
the same lecture you gave me

213
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,400
back in
middle school.

214
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,037
I got my butt kicked in a
pre‐tournament practice game...

215
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:33,307
I was starting to give up
on winning for real.

216
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,810
Even if you're not confident
that you can win...

217
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,446
and even if everyone around
you says that it's impossible...

218
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,082
no matter what...

219
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:44,952
"Never say never... Don't admit
defeat 'til you've tried!"

220
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,454
Remember?

221
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:49,724
Sorry! I just have a habit
of chickening out

222
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,626
right before a tournament!

223
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:53,094
(whines)
I hate it!

224
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,930
I guess I shouldn't
be telling you what to do.

225
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,667
But we ARE both captains...
so I've always got your back...

226
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,103
Feel free to talk to me
anytime, okay?

227
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,307
(laughs)
You're so weird... Ha!

228
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,111
Okay! I'm good!

229
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:14,281
See ya, Daichi.
Thanks a lot!

230
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:25,860
Listen carefully...
my special protégé...

231
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,996
I want to crush you fair and
square at an official game,

232
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,165
where we both play the setter!

233
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,801
What's his deal?

234
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,202
Hell if I know.

235
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,686
(final whistle)

236
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:54,155
Hey, Asahi!

237
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,422
Club! Time to go!

238
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:56,824
That was
kinda rude.

239
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,460
Yeah, he's
not a dumb dog.

240
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:01,996
You don't have to do that
every time, Nishinoya...

241
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:05,332
I'm not gonna
run away.

242
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,970
[Asahi]:
I understand
everyone's got my back.

243
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,009
I will hold
my head up high...

244
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:18,713
and show everyone that
I'm Karasuno's ace!

245
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,283
Hinata!

246
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:23,785
Oh Sugawara.

247
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:26,588
Perfect timing...
I have something for you.

248
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:29,190
I made copies for
all the first‐years.

249
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,959
Signals.

250
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,495
My technical skill's not
as good as Kageyama's is,

251
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:37,799
so I can't always toss perfect
sets... but hand signals might

252
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:41,536
help us communicate our
next move during a game.

253
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:43,971
It might take some time but
it'll probably help for you

254
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,673
to memorize
all these.

255
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,008
Are you kidding me?!

256
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:49,544
This is gonna be so awesome;
I can't wait!

257
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:51,979
Great... I'm sure we'll have
to work out the kinks

258
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,248
before we can use
them in a game...

259
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,718
so let's practice
as much as we can.

260
00:11:56,818 --> 00:11:59,554
Sure! I promise I'll learn
to hit any set!

261
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:02,256
Give me some time...
I can master it!

262
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:17,238
We use a triple front decoy...
and a back attack.

263
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:21,442
Keishin? Did you get any more
Mirin in stock yet?

264
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:23,477
Be right with you‐
Ahh...

265
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:28,282
[Keishin]:
(yelps)
[Old Lady]:
Well don't just throw it

266
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:35,957
So uh what's the matter
with you Tanaka?

267
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:37,491
The tournament's
almost here.

268
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:38,926
Yeah?

269
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,427
And tournaments are supposed
to be all dramatic

270
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:42,396
like we're marching into battle,
you know what I mean?

271
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,731
Uhh... sure.

272
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,600
And the most important
part of that

273
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,201
is having a
cute girlfriend.

274
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:49,436
Isn't your big sports
thing is tomorrow.

275
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:51,172
Yes, darling,
it is.

276
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,775
Isn't this the one you've
been practicing so hard for?

277
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,311
Yeah, baby, I can't thank you
enough for supporting my dream.

278
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:59,046
Oh, I don't mind at all!

279
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,347
(giggles)

280
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,917
Nothing makes me happier
than watching you play, baby!

281
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:04,986
Do you mean it?

282
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:06,988
[Ryunosuke's "girlfriend"]:
I really wanted to do something
for you before the game...

283
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:09,056
so I... um... made you this.

284
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,759
[Ryunosuke]:
Is that a
good luck charm?

285
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:15,162
That's right...
do your best, okay?

286
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,032
[Ryunosuke]:
See, I want to be more
fired up about the game...

287
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:21,703
but first I need a
girlfriend... one that's sexy!

288
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,237
Keep the crazy talk
to a minimum

289
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,507
or I'll tell the coach
to give me your spot.

290
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:26,574
Huh?!

291
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:31,979
[Chikara]:
Nice kill!

292
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,414
[Tobio]:
Excellent!

293
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:34,582
Hey Man‐bun.

294
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:36,183
Sir!

295
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,119
Would you say you're pretty
decent at back attacks?

296
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:41,956
[Keishin]:
Over here! I want
to try something.

297
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:45,226
So do boys think
you can handle that?

298
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,729
Well first we need to find
the right hitting height.

299
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:49,263
That looks tricky.

300
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:53,601
We'll do our best. Thank
you for your advice, Coach.

301
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:56,704
[Keishin]:
Hinata, keep diving
in just like before!

302
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:58,272
[Shoyo]:
Yes, sir!

303
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,108
[Daichi]:
Keep it up!

304
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,810
[Team Karasuno]:
Right!

305
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,579
[Tobio]:
Asahi, would you mind practicing
with me a little more?

306
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,548
You know... you're looking
really tired lately, Coach.

307
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:09,917
Come to think of it,
I noticed you've been showing up

308
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,819
right when our practice
starts every day.

309
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,821
Is everything going
okay at your job?

310
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:18,125
Mhmm... Up until recently the
store was all I had going on.

311
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,827
But now I've started
tending crops

312
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,328
in the early
morning hours,

313
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:24,231
so I've had to work
night shifts instead.

314
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,300
I've been thinking maybe
it's about time I stopped

315
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,603
relying so much
on my folks, you know?

316
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:32,306
Th‐thank you so much! I owe you
a nice bottle of sake!

317
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:34,008
Oh yeah?!

318
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:38,012
[Takeda]:
Wow, this is a lot of different
attack patterns to practice...

319
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,947
Are you planning
to use all of them?

320
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,716
[Keishin]:
Well... that depends.

321
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:43,885
It's important to make sure
these guys stay focused

322
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:46,020
on the game in
front of them.

323
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,089
That's not to say it's a bad
idea to go ahead and prepare

324
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:50,592
ourselves for all
the other games, too.

325
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:53,260
Don't tell 'em
I said that.

326
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,029
[Koshi]:
Great job, Hinata!
You did it!

327
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,498
That Hinata‐Sugawara quick
attack's looking good!

328
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,501
Oh I like that. The way you
did it that time felt perfect!

329
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,237
[Ryunosuke]:
Sweet!

330
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:05,339
Hey Asahi! What did you think
of that last one?

331
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:08,109
Too high? Too low? How was it?
C'mon you can be honest with me!

332
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:10,545
Uh, it was fine..
mhm.. good‐

333
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:12,980
Don't hold back!
Whatever criticism you have,

334
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,049
I can handle it!
Just tell me!

335
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,184
Uhhh, huh...

336
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,721
Okay, then, maybe aim it
a little higher?

337
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:22,489
And you could try sending it a
little further from the net too.

338
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,660
Right, thank you!
10 more tries!

339
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,495
[Tobio]:
Not enough?
How about 20?!
The tournament's

340
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:31,999
there's no time to start
changing things up.

341
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,668
Don't forget the
timing we practiced.

342
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,402
Right!

343
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:38,005
Oh, okay I get it; you want to
practice another pattern now.

344
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,041
[Daichi]:
Alright, let's go,
it's getting late.

345
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:41,976
[Team Karasuno]:
Yes, sir!

346
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:45,312
[Shoyo/Tobio]:
Haaaaa!

347
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:51,152
[Daichi]:
Could you two stop competing
and mop like normal people?
Hey Kiyoko. Daichi's gonna treat

348
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:54,255
I'm sorry... I have
something else to do.

349
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:56,558
[Koshi]:
Oh, okay. See ya.

350
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:58,225
Goodnight.

351
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,729
[Daichi]:
One for everybody.

352
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:03,497
[Tobio]:
Thank you.

353
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:05,166
[Shoyo]:
You're the best, captain!
[Yu]:
Yeah, thanks Daichi!

354
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:08,169
Everybody eat up so
we can go home.

355
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:12,774
Hey Tsukishima, the captain
bought everybody a meat bun,

356
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:13,608
you want one?

357
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,109
Sure, thank you.

358
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:16,878
Hey, did Tadashi
leave already?

359
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:20,715
He said there was somewhere he
needed to go on the way home.

360
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,385
[Tadashi]:
Um...

361
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,288
Uh sorry, we're actually
closed for the day.

362
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:30,124
I'm Yamaguchi from
the volleyball club.

363
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:33,861
Right! So that's
where I know you from.

364
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:37,364
Look... The jump
float serve...

365
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,667
Do you think you can
teach me how to do it?

366
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:43,470
[Shimada]:
Oh, yeah...

367
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,707
I used it when we played
each other, didn't I?

368
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,476
I would, but the Prelims
are right around the corner

369
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:52,013
aren't they? If you're
wanting to learn before then,

370
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:54,081
I don't think you
have enough time.

371
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,583
You're probably right.

372
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:58,820
Odds are I won't get
to play in the game, anyway.

373
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,355
First‐years don't usually
have a chance to play

374
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:05,693
if there are third‐years
on the team... But still...

375
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:09,731
Despite all that... I never want
to be the only first‐year

376
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:11,599
on the bench again!

377
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:28,583
[♪♪♪♪]

378
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:52,399
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheers)

379
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,036
I say we call it early
and get some rest.

380
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:56,070
Right!

381
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,639
Okay...., let's
go home‐

382
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:58,940
W‐Wait, don't leave yet!

383
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,343
We have one more comment.
It's from Kiyoko.

384
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:05,012
(surprised gasps)

385
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:08,516
I'm not very...
good with words...

386
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,885
So I kinda
did something.

387
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:15,289
[Kiyoko]:
If you please, Takeda.

388
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,158
[Takeda]:
Of course.

389
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:19,493
[Kiyoko]:
Ah! Wait, sir... Please,
let me take that up there.

390
00:19:19,594 --> 00:19:21,028
[Takeda]:
I got it.

391
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:22,730
What is
that thing?

392
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:28,169
[Takeda]:
And, go!

393
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,976
Whoa!

394
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:37,044
[Koshi]:
We have a banner?

395
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:40,347
I found it while I was cleaning
up, so I thought I'd wash it.

396
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,750
YEAH! I'm
fired up!

397
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,252
You're awesome, Kiyoko!
Thanks for everything!

398
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,555
We're ready now!
Let's win this thing! Huh?

399
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:51,092
Not yet... Listen guys...

400
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:52,727
[Daichi]:
I think there's more.

401
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:54,228
Huh?!

402
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:57,765
You...

403
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,300
Huh?

404
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,872
You can do it.

405
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,461
Uh...

406
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,664
Kiyoko! She's never done
anything like this before!

407
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,465
Him, too?
Kiyoko! She's never done
anything like this before!

408
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,201
I don't get it; why are
they so freaked out by this?

409
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,170
Most of the time,
you can't shut them up.

410
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,105
[Upperclassmen]:
(dramatic sobbing)

411
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:40,808
[Kei]:
What the hell?!
Calm down already!

412
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:44,145
We can win!...
The first round is all ours!

413
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,213
Yeah!

414
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,015
(collective cheering)

415
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,364
I'm the first one here!

416
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,608
[Shoyo]:
Hey, get back
here, Kageyama!

417
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:21,082
You like that?
I beat you this time.

418
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:25,419
[Tobio]:
Now the score's:
31 ‐ 30 with one tie.

419
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:29,691
That's wrong.

420
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,626
Hell no, it's not!
I'm ahead of you!

421
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:35,630
Yeah, you are...
but that makes it 30 ‐ 32.

422
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:41,736
I lost to you this
time last year, too.

423
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,943
You beat me bad.

424
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:58,085
You might be the king who
rules the court for now...

425
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:03,424
But I'm gonna win!

426
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:06,460
One day I'll stay in the court
longer than you!

427
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,765
Listen to me.

428
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:17,304
I'll beat you! If it takes 10
or even 20 more years, I WILL!

429
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:22,644
Wait a sec... You think one day,
your dumb ass'll be on my level?

430
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,413
Yeah... That's right!

431
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:29,717
Even the best in all of Japan?
And the world?

432
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:31,553
The world?!

433
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,123
[Shoyo]:
U‐um ... Obviously!

434
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,695
And I told you,
not to call me the king.

435
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:43,765
Let's go.
That hurt...

436
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:46,568
The real journey
begins today.

437
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:49,470
Yeah!

438
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:25,567
[Ryunosuke]:
(blubbering)
[Kei]:

439
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,434
[Ryunosuke]:
Kiyoko said
it's okay to cry!

440
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:29,470
[Kei]:
Yeah... but that
was yesterday.

441
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:30,972
[Yu]:
Dammit, don't
make me relive it!

442
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:33,608
[Kei]:
Ugh. You guys
are pathetic.

443
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,778
[Kei]:
Next Haikyu!! "We're back."

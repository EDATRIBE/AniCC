1
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:18,342
[SHOYO, voiceover]
There's an enormous wall in
front of me, blocking my way.

2
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:26,217
[SHOYO, voiceover]
I can only wonder
what's on the other side?

3
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:29,186
What does it look like?

4
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:35,026
Is it the view
from the summit?

5
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:38,095
I'll never be able
to see it on my own.

6
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:41,899
But if I have
others on my side...

7
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,504
[ALL]
Thank you!

8
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:24,268
[SHOPKEEPER]
Good morning!... Come on in!

9
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:25,970
[CUSTOMER]
Alright!

10
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,373
(cheers on TV)
[SHOYO] Eh?

11
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,942
(exhale)

12
00:02:33,177 --> 00:02:34,378
(amazed)

13
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,888
(shocked)

14
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:49,527
[KARASUNO] (cheering)
[TV ANNOUNCER] He did it!
That's five points in a row
for Karasuno High

15
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,830
[MAN A] Whoa!
[TV ANNOUNCER] in the Spring
High School National Volleyball
Championship.

16
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,667
He might be surrounded by
players as tall as 6 foot 2,

17
00:02:55,767 --> 00:03:00,037
but that does not stop
Karasuno's Tiny Giant from
making a huge impact.

18
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:03,708
[MAN B]
Oh, Karasuno, the next town
over... They're not half bad.

19
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,044
[IZUMI]
Hmph! Hurry up, Hinata, we're
gonna lose our soccer field!

20
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:09,446
Karasuno...

21
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:18,823
[IZUMI]
Hinata, slow down!

22
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:21,258
(pre‐game warmups, shouts
of encouragement)

23
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:22,894
(exhale)

24
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,897
(OM inhale)
It's huge.

25
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:28,365
(sniff)

26
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:30,502
It smells like Air Salonpas.

27
00:03:30,602 --> 00:03:33,304
[IZUMI]
Don't say stuff like that,
Hinata... It's dorky.

28
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:34,839
[KOJI]
Yeah, don't be that guy.

29
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,275
But guys, this is my very
first real volleyball game!

30
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,912
I've waited 3 long
years for this!

31
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,081
[KOJI]
That's true, I guess it
is kind of amazing that
we made it this far.

32
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:45,550
[GUYS]
Two and three and...

33
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,556
(jogging, volleyball efforts)
(encouragement)

34
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:56,561
[SHOYO]
Izumin, Koji... Thanks for
coming to help our team out.

35
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:58,462
[BOTH] (surprised)
[KOJI] Don't make it weird!
(pout)

36
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:01,966
Our game was the first
one to finish; no need
to make it a big deal.

37
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,801
[SHOYO]
You too, first‐years!

38
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,871
I'm so thankful you three
joined the volleyball club
with me this season!

39
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:10,508
[MORI]
Uh, sure... We're pretty
terrible at this whole
thing, but okay.

40
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,143
Spare us the tears, Shoyo.

41
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,277
I'm not crying!

42
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:14,679
You've got tears
in your eyes.

43
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:16,781
[SUZUKI]
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt...

44
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,316
but we really
should warm up now.
Huh?

45
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,218
Come on, Captain,
you're in charge here.

46
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:23,988
He's right, Shoyo! You're
the one who dragged us into
this tournament thing,

47
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:26,290
and you still haven't explained
what all the rules are!

48
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,092
Uh! I know that!

49
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:32,029
Even though we barely made
the cut... we're here to
win this! Okay, guys?

50
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:35,366
[IZUMI]
We can't win with a thrown
together team of rookies!

51
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,768
[SHOYO]
Sure we can!

52
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:39,003
[KOJI]
Kitagawa First might
be tough though.

53
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,739
[SHOYO]
Maybe... but I'll
beat 'em anyway!

54
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,407
(IZUMI sighs)
(KOJI stunned)

55
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:45,510
(startled)

56
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,079
[SHOYO]
Uh? Ah... Gyahhh!

57
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:50,114
[IZUMI]
Excuse us! Move, dude!

58
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:52,116
(SHOYO yanked)
[ALL] Uh...

59
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,086
[KOJI]
They're tall!

60
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,962
(mighty cheer from stands)
[SHOYO] (startled) Huh?!

61
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:08,566
[CROWD]
Kita Go! Kita Go!

62
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,935
Hey, Kitagawa
First is here.

63
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:11,869
They're huge.

64
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,871
Those guys scare
the hell outta me.

65
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:15,372
They're the best
team around here.

66
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:17,008
They've got the King.

67
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,242
The King?

68
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:19,611
(cowering)
[ORANGE] What you don't know?

69
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:21,646
That's what they
call Tobio Kageyama.

70
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:23,848
He's a setter. And he's
supposed to be awesome.

71
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,251
Tch! Dammit, we're going
to going up against these
freakin' guys.

72
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:31,188
It'll be fine! I don't care
how big they are; I'll bust
right through 'em!

73
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:34,258
Maybe you're right,
Hinata; you are a
really good jumper!

74
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:35,426
You've got this!

75
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:37,228
(SHOYO's stomach gurgling)

76
00:05:37,328 --> 00:05:40,131
[KOJI] Uh...
[SHOYO] Wonder where
the... bathrooms are...

77
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:42,499
(SHOYO nauseous)
(ALL worried)

78
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:46,571
[KITAGAWA A]
Have you guys even heard of
Yukigaoka Middle School?

79
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:50,241
[KITAGAWA B]
No, but the whole team looks
pretty shrimpy, and they don't
even have a libero.

80
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:53,611
[KITAGAWA C]
This'll be a piece of cake...
I almost feel a little guilty.

81
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,847
[SHOYO] You three!
(KITAGAWA startled)

82
00:05:57,214 --> 00:06:00,017
You better not get all cocky...
(nauseous, grunting)

83
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:04,722
Because as soon as my tummy
stops being upset, I am gonna
wipe the floor with you jerks
out there...

84
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,925
Do you hear me?
(nauseous, pained)

85
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:09,994
[KITAGAWA] Uhhh...
(bust out laughing)

86
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:11,596
[KITAGAWA A]
I can't wait to see that!

87
00:06:11,696 --> 00:06:13,130
[KITAGAWA B]
He needs his mommy! (laughing)

88
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,166
[KITAGAWA C]
Look, he's wearing the
captain's mark too!

89
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,468
[SHOYO, internal]
Ugh, they're making fun of me!

90
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,136
[TOBIO]
Hey... second‐years.

91
00:06:20,572 --> 00:06:21,873
(gasp)

92
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:27,344
The official warm‐up's about
to start... Get moving.

93
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:28,846
[KITAGAWA A]
Yes sir! On our way!

94
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,148
[KITAGAWA B]
Whatever you say, Kageyama!

95
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,019
(scared)

96
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,154
[KITAGAWA B]
Hurry up, man. We
need to fill two more!

97
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:40,091
[KITAGAWA C]
The game won't last long
enough to drink all those...

98
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,058
Not against them.

99
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:42,293
[SHOYO]
Gah!

100
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:43,595
[KITAGAWA A]
Hah! Yeah, good point!

101
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:44,696
[SHOYO] What did you say?!

102
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:46,363
[TOBIO]
Look, you three.

103
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:48,633
You're not even warming
the bench yet.

104
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,335
You think you have the right
to look down on the competition?

105
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:52,837
(scared)

106
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,306
[TOBIO]
You can't hide behind our
school's reputation.

107
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:57,274
[KITAGAWA A]
W‐we're sorry!

108
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:00,477
Whoa... Uh!

109
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:04,415
Thanks, bro; I was about to
tell those losers off myself,
but whatever...

110
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:06,183
(TOBIO annoyed)
(SHOYO startled)

111
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:07,652
They were making fun of you

112
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,587
because you can't even handle a
little stomachache...

113
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:11,488
You have no right
to run your mouth.

114
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:12,957
[SHOYO]
Huh... Hey!

115
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,459
Why did you come to
this tournament anyway?

116
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,394
Just for fun or what?

117
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:19,931
(offended) No way,
I came to win!

118
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:23,935
You make winning sound so easy.

119
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,540
[SHOYO]
(uneasy) I know I'm
not very tall... but...

120
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,574
Huh?

121
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:31,075
I can still jump!

122
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:32,644
Hm...

123
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,512
As long as you don't
give up trying,

124
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:36,113
there's always a
chance at victory!

125
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:41,318
[TOBIO]
Yeah, well not giving up is
easier said than done!

126
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:46,624
[SHOYO]
Look, today's the day I finally
get to play volleyball on a real
court with 6 players.

127
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:51,763
So I'm gonna win the first
round, then the second, and
every match after that!

128
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:54,832
And not just in this
tournament, but all of them!

129
00:07:56,568 --> 00:08:02,774
[TOBIO]
From the first round, to the
second, the final, all the way
to nationals...

130
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:06,978
I'm going to be the one standing
in the winner's court, got it!

131
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:08,312
(determined)

132
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,585
[TOBIO] Hmph!

133
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:19,591
What's your deal?!

134
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:20,892
[SHOYO] Oh, Izumin.

135
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,426
[IZUMI]
I thought you went
to the bathroom;

136
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,361
why were you picking
a fight with him?

137
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:25,396
We should get back!

138
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:26,664
Aren't you sick? Hey!

139
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:28,399
[SHOYO]
Nope!
Dude...

140
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:32,136
(warming up)

141
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:34,338
[SHOYO, internal]
Man, they're pretty good.

142
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:35,573
[KOJI]
Oh? (wincing)

143
00:08:35,673 --> 00:08:37,709
So that scary guy must
be their setter.

144
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:42,046
I think that's Kageyama, the one
they were calling King of the
Court or whatever, right?

145
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,148
Anyway, remind me
what a setter is?

146
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:46,718
[IZUMI]
That's the position that
hits the ball up first...

147
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,485
We just learned that yesterday!

148
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:49,554
Oh, did we?

149
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,355
(playing volleyball)

150
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,224
[TOBIO]
Your timing is too slow...

151
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,993
A quick attack should
be faster than that!

152
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:57,361
[YUTARO]
Sorry.

153
00:08:57,461 --> 00:08:58,963
[COACH] Kageyama...
[TOBIO] Hm?

154
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:01,065
You shouldn't be
obsessing over speed...

155
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,100
It isn't about your personal
technique;

156
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,037
it's about how well you're
able to set up the ball for
the spiker to hit.

157
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:07,304
You understand?

158
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:08,439
[TOBIO]
Yes sir.

159
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,574
(troubled)

160
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,275
(whistle blowing)

161
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,251
[SHOYO]
This is finally happening!

162
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,855
[CROWD] (cheering)
(whistle blowing)
[ALL] Time to start!

163
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:25,990
[AKIRA]
The other team's
kinda scrawny, huh?

164
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,293
[SHOYO]
Koji! I want you to show me
your back number, okay?

165
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:31,328
[KOJI] What?
(whistle blowing)

166
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:33,931
[SHOYO] Koji!

167
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,266
[KOJI] Gah!
(whistle)

168
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,234
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:38,770
Nah, don't worry about it!

170
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,505
[KITAGAWA #8]
You got this!

171
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:42,473
(startled)
(whistle)
(CROWD cheering)

172
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:44,742
[SCORER A] Man, those poor kids
aren't ever gonna score a point.

173
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:47,178
[SHOYO] Hang in there, guys!
[SCORER B] Well, at least we'll
be done a little sooner.

174
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:49,647
[SCORER A] Yeah, I've got
some shows to watch. Uh?

175
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:51,816
[SHOYO] There's No reason to
beat yourself up!...
[CROWD] Let's go Kitagawa, go!
(continuous cheer)

176
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,250
Just try harder next time.

177
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,419
[KOJI] Uh.. yeah!
This time I'll nail it!

178
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,955
[SHOYO, internal]
I've worked too hard
to get here...

179
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,758
I'm not gonna let it
end that easily!

180
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:09,000
[SHOYO]
Huh? I'm...
the only club member?

181
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,736
Oh yeah, the numbers
go down every year.

182
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:15,707
And so you know, our boys'
volleyball is just a fan club;
it's not a real team.

183
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:16,974
Okay...

184
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,475
So what do you want to do then?

185
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,677
You can pick a different club,

186
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:20,945
or I can put you in
girls' volleyball.

187
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:23,247
Hm? Uh.. that's
not gonna work...

188
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:25,382
I can do it by myself!

189
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:26,417
If you want.

190
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:28,185
I'll be the next Tiny Giant!

191
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:29,854
Huh?.. Tiny what?

192
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:32,590
(whistle)

193
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,760
(cheering)

194
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:37,829
(exert)

195
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:38,796
[GIRLS]
Nice serve!

196
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:40,131
[GIRL]
Nice receive!

197
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,332
(encouragement)

198
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,734
[SHOYO]
Gyah!

199
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:46,203
Got it!

200
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:48,139
(breathless)

201
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:52,644
[GIRL B] Circle up!
Okay, let's go for a run.

202
00:10:52,744 --> 00:10:53,645
[GIRLS] 'Kay!

203
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:54,946
Perfect!

204
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:56,080
[IZUMI] So, that happened.
[BOY B] Wow.

205
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,381
You're on a break,
right, Izumin?

206
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,883
Set me up for some spikes!

207
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:00,184
Why would I do that?

208
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,019
I just wanna see if
I can hit a good spike!

209
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,921
No way dude,
I don't even know how.

210
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:05,990
All you have to do is
throw it so I can hit it!

211
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,125
I can't, okay? The
upperclassmen are watching.

212
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:10,662
[BOY C] Over here!
[BOTH] Oh? Okay, one sec!

213
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:12,163
(disappointed)

214
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:14,699
(leap)

215
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,835
(cheering)

216
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:21,839
[BOY A]
'Sup, Hinata? I heard you joined
the girls' volleyball team;
what's up with that?

217
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:23,975
(SHOYO spitting)
[BOY B] Man, you're
such a player!

218
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:25,176
It's not like that!

219
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:27,011
[BOY A]
So which girl you after?

220
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:29,280
[BOY B]
There's a lot of smokin'
hot third‐years on the team.

221
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,449
(startled) Well, yeah some
of them are cute, but‐

222
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,585
[BOY A]
Awww yeah!

223
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:34,619
Shut up, you guys!

224
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:36,854
I'm on the boys' team, okay?!

225
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:40,191
(whistle)
(cheering)

226
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,264
[KOJI]
You know... You sure practice a
lot for someone who never
actually gets to play.

227
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:50,201
Hey!.. I'll get to play
one day; just wait and see!

228
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:55,507
(run efforts)
[SHOYO] Everybody turns me
down now, but I'm gonna get a
whole bunch of guys to play!

229
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:56,908
[KOJI] If you say so.

230
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,142
[SHOYO] Hey, Koji‐

231
00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:00,978
[KOJI]
For the last time,
not happening.

232
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:04,982
(whistle)
(cheering)

233
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,287
[SHOYO]
(exert) Hey, Izumin!

234
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:11,856
(IZUMI startled)
[SHOYO] You got a second?

235
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:14,025
[IZUMI]
Sorry, I've got an exam to cram!

236
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:18,129
(whistle)
(cheer)

237
00:12:18,663 --> 00:12:19,997
Aw, man...

238
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:22,233
[SHOYO] It's okay!
[YUTARO] Hey, nice one!

239
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:27,705
[KOJI] Heads up!

240
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:29,373
Hm? (knocked out)

241
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:32,309
Shoyo! Are you okay?

242
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:34,245
[SHOYO] Ow...

243
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:35,246
My bad, dude.

244
00:12:35,346 --> 00:12:36,548
(SHOYO perk up)
(KOJI surprised)

245
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:38,315
Could you set for me real quick?

246
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:39,551
(grin)

247
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:42,419
This time, I'll‐ (hit)

248
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,121
[SHOYO]
Koji! Izumin!

249
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,192
[IZUMI]
Hey, can we stop now?

250
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,862
My arms hurt and I can't seem to
aim the ball that well...

251
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:52,163
This is getting old.

252
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:53,998
Just one more try, I promise!

253
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,467
I'll get some first‐years
to join me soon!

254
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,036
[IZUMI]
But you just said one more
a few minutes ago...

255
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:01,205
This is the last one
for real, okay?

256
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:02,339
Thank you!

257
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,075
Ready?

258
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,477
Oh... oops‐

259
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,552
[IZUMI]
It's all you, Hina!

260
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,721
[SHOYO, internal]
I may be on the short side,

261
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:18,756
but I can jump high
to make up for it.

262
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:20,525
Higher than any wall!

263
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,095
( surprised)

264
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:26,263
(whistle)
(cheering)

265
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:28,232
[YUTARO] Yes!
[IZUMI] Shake it off, Hinata!

266
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:30,802
[SHOYO] Uh?
[KOJI] I'll throw you
another one, okay?

267
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:32,069
[SHOYO] S‐sorry!

268
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,640
[SHOYO]
Man, that should've been
my shot.

269
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,509
[SHOYO]
I'll get the next one.

270
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:00,197
(whistle and cheering)
[YUTARO] Sweet!

271
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,834
Wow... Their number
5 doesn't mess around.

272
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:06,704
Well, at least Yukigaoka's
scoring a few points in the
second set...

273
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,105
That's a little better

274
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,074
Those are all the other
team's errors though.

275
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:10,875
[KOJI] Here goes!

276
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,876
Huh?

277
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,877
[IZUMI] Gotcha!

278
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,411
(grunt)

279
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:18,550
[SHOYO, internal]
The wall! I can't see
the other side!

280
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,051
(whistle)
(cheer)

281
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,486
Man... It's like they're
anticipating their every move.

282
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:24,656
And the short guy
can really jump too.

283
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:27,024
[KOJI] Hang in there, dude.
You'll get the next one.
[SCORER A] It's too bad.

284
00:14:27,124 --> 00:14:29,026
[IZUMI]
That's right! We got this!

285
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:33,197
(whistle and cheer)

286
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:34,866
[YUTARO]
Phew! That was close!

287
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:36,067
Pick up the pace!

288
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,169
Tch!
[AKIRA]
Nice.

289
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:40,872
Yeah... The captain's doing
those crazy sets again though.

290
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:43,975
What's the deal? The other team
doesn't even have any defense.

291
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:46,043
[AKIRA]
Why's he going all out?

292
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:49,881
[TOBIO, annoyed]
The real question is why
aren't you guys taking this
game seriously?!

293
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:51,849
Dude, chill!
It's not the time!

294
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,651
Check that out...

295
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,921
The setter for Kita First
is really good at what he
does and all, but...

296
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,456
it's almost like he's
playing by himself.

297
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:00,758
(whistle)

298
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:03,327
[KAWASHIMA]
Got it! Huh?

299
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:05,162
[AKIRA]
Looks like that's gonna
be a service ace!

300
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:07,331
[TOBIO] Not yet!
[YUTARO] He'll never hit that.

301
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:10,201
[SHOYO, internal]
It's not over until the
ball hits the ground...

302
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:11,936
(slide and tumble)

303
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,371
(CROWD cheering)

304
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:15,673
Ah! You okay?!

305
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:17,174
Man, that's gotta hurt.

306
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:18,776
He's a tough one.

307
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,313
If Kita gets one more point,
then this thing is all over.

308
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:23,515
Uh‐huh.

309
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:25,517
[SHOYO]
Man...

310
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:27,652
[KAWASHIMA]
Sorry... that was my fault.

311
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,220
Nah, I'll get the next one!

312
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,788
[KAWASHIMA] Look!
[SHOYO IZUMI] Huh?

313
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,457
Um... You almost
got hurt just now.

314
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,860
[KAWASHIMA] But we're never
gonna beat these guys.
[BOY] Almost over!

315
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,495
[KAWASHIMA] Why are
you trying so hard?
[TOBIO] Do it just
like the last one.

316
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:42,667
[CROWD, repeating]
Kita Go! Kita Go!
[SHOYO] Huh? Uh... I'm sorry...

317
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:50,441
[SHOYO]
I don't really understand
what you're asking me. But
it's... not over.

318
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:54,979
[TOBIO, internal]
(breath) He's right,
it's simple...

319
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:59,350
[TOBIO, internal]
No matter how tricky the
ball is, there's still a
reason to go after it.

320
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:01,686
[SHOYO]
Koji!

321
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:04,589
[SHOYO, internal]
The ball hasn't
hit the floor yet.

322
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:06,791
[IZUMI] Nice one!
[TOBIO, internal] No matter
how bad the odds are,

323
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:10,094
[TOBIO, internal] there's always
a reason to keep playing.
[KOJI] Come on, Shoyo!

324
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:14,331
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Because we haven't lost yet!

325
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:15,700
[YUTARO] One‐touch!

326
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,102
Cover it, get back!

327
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:20,337
[AKIRA, internal]
I'll never make it in time.

328
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,008
Aw yeah!

329
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,009
(happy)

330
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,511
(look, startled)

331
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:29,581
[TOBIO]
Why didn't you run for it?

332
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,751
Uh, sorry.

333
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:35,186
Don't ever let your guard down;

334
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,188
don't stop playing
until the game is over

335
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,356
Yeah, I understand
that but...

336
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,126
it would take a miracle
for them to catch up to
us at this point.

337
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:46,197
The point they scored was
no miracle... It was stolen.

338
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:50,467
By that kid! Right there!
He stole our point!

339
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:52,436
[KOJI] Right, let's
get another one!
[AKIRA] Uh, okay...

340
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:55,740
I mean, you're not wrong,
but come on, dude...
(scowl)

341
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:03,515
[KITAGAWA #1] Inside
the net! Front, front!
[MORI] Izumi, I'm free!

342
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:07,218
[SHOYO] As long as you don't
give up trying, there's always
a chance at victory!
[IZUMI] It's all yours, Hinata!

343
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,388
[TOBIO, internal]
A miss hit? It didn't count as a
dribble...

344
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,125
[TOBIO, internal]
But nobody's covering
over there.

345
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:19,296
(gasp)

346
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:22,700
[TOBIO, internal]
No, he went left!

347
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,870
[TOBIO, internal]
I swear I had my eye on him!

348
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,639
[TOBIO, internal]
So how...

349
00:17:29,273 --> 00:17:31,208
[TOBIO, internal]
How is he over here?!

350
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:36,247
[IZUMI]
Hinata!

351
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,115
Are you okay, kid?

352
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:39,851
(whistle)

353
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:42,086
[SHOYO] It was out?

354
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,821
(sad)
(CROWD cheering)

355
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:47,358
(long whistle)

356
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,393
[IZUMI]
That looked like it hurt...

357
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:52,129
[TOBIO, internal] I could
barely keep track of him.
[KOJI] You did your best, buddy.

358
00:17:52,229 --> 00:17:57,401
[TOBIO, internal]
That was the setter's mistake.
There's no way he could have
anticipated it.

359
00:17:58,302 --> 00:18:00,071
[TOBIO, internal]
How did he hit that?

360
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:04,776
[TOBIO, internal]
Is it even possible for a person
to react that quickly?

361
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:08,145
Hinata, let's line up.

362
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:10,948
[TOBIO, internal] Athletic
ability... reflexes...
[YUTARO] Hey Kageyama, what are
you doing?

363
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,951
[TOBIO, internal] a sense
of control over his body...
[YUTARO] Quit daydreaming and
get in line so we can crush

364
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:20,625
[TOBIO, internal]
and most importantly,
determination to win. He
may have all that, but...

365
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,761
(frustrated) What have you
been wasting all your time
on for three years?!

366
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:25,329
(breath)

367
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:27,732
[KOJI] What did you say?!
[IZUMI] Koji, calm down!

368
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:29,934
[KOJI]
You don't know a damn thing
about what Shoyo's been doing!

369
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:33,204
[IZUMI] You can't pick a fight
in the middle of the court!
[KOJI] Watch me!

370
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:37,241
[SHOYO, internal] My first and
last real game in middle school.
[REFEREE] Game's over, boys,
line up.

371
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:39,210
[IZUMI]
Come on, Hinata, let's go.

372
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,579
[SHOYO, internal]
We lost every set.

373
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,651
[SHOYO, internal]
Start to finish, the game
lasted only 31 minutes.

374
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:51,989
(STUDENTS muttering)

375
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,126
[KOSHI]
So that's the King
of the Court, huh?

376
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:59,363
[DAICHI]
Uh‐huh, He'll be a force
to be reckoned with when
he gets to high school.

377
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:02,299
[RYUNOSUKE]
The short kid seems
promising too.

378
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:14,278
(troubled)

379
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:16,380
Hey, we never stood
a chance anyway;

380
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,383
I heard those guys are
candidates for the nationals.

381
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:21,786
[YUTARO]
I could go for some
food right about now.

382
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:24,622
[AKIRA]
Whatever. You're always hungry.

383
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:25,857
(KOJI sighing)

384
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,059
No matter how good or
bad each team is...

385
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:31,796
...in the end, it all comes
down to winning or losing...

386
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:35,800
If you lose... then you have
to step off the court.

387
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,672
(deep breath)

388
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,273
[IZUMI]
(surprised) Hey, wait up!

389
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:43,941
[KOJI]
Hey! What's the rush?!

390
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:44,876
[SHOYO]
Hold it!

391
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,343
Hmm?

392
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:53,217
(sob) You might be the King
who rules the court for now...

393
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,555
(sobbing)

394
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:03,360
[SHOYO]
But I'm gonna win!... (sob) One
day I'm gonna stay in the court
for longer than you!

395
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,000
(SHOYO sobbing)

396
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,606
[TOBIO]
Only those who win get to
stay in the court... Only
the strongest.

397
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:18,643
So if you want to keep
playing, then you have
to become stronger.

398
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,225
[SHOYO, internal]
So what am I missing? (CM sigh)

399
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:35,492
[KOJI IZUMI] (surprised)

400
00:20:35,593 --> 00:20:36,761
[SHOYO]
Thanks for everything!

401
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,696
(choked up)

402
00:20:38,796 --> 00:20:40,665
Dude... Don't
make it awkward!

403
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:42,867
[KOJI]
You don't have to
thank us, alright?!

404
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:45,336
[SHOYO]
Huh? What are you crying for?

405
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:47,572
[KOJI]
(sob) I'm not crying, okay?

406
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,151
[KOJI]
See ya, Shoyo!

407
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,954
[IZUMI]
See you later! Bye! Woo! Hah!

408
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:47,398
[SHOYO]
30 minutes over
the hills by bike!

409
00:21:47,498 --> 00:21:52,136
[SHOYO]
It's my first day at
Miyagi Prefectural
Karasuno High School.

410
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:54,138
[BOY A]
Hey, does any one want
to join the soccer club?

411
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:56,541
[BOY B]
We need someone to manage the
baseball club; you interested?

412
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:58,075
(SHOYO running)
[BOY C] Huh?

413
00:21:58,175 --> 00:22:00,311
[KIYOKO]
Here... These are all
the current applicants.

414
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:04,616
[DAICHI]
Thanks. Wow, that's not
very many. Didn't we used
to get more of these?

415
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:06,417
[KOSHI]
I'm sure we'll get more, Daichi.

416
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:08,986
[RYUNOSUKE]
You're looking radiant
today, Kiyoko!

417
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:11,823
[RYUNOSUKE]
Gah... I love when
she ignores me.

418
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,460
[SHOYO, internal]
Get ready, Karasuno,
'cause I'm here!

419
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:19,931
[SHOYO, internal]
I'm gonna practice like crazy!

420
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:22,767
[SHOYO, internal]
I'll challenge that
King of the Court guy...

421
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:25,202
[SHOYO]
...and get revenge!

422
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:27,872
[SHOYO] (land)

423
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,910
(stunned)

424
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:38,783
[SHOYO]
What?! You're here too?!

425
00:22:38,883 --> 00:22:41,185
[TOBIO]
(startled) (stumble)

426
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,856
[TOBIO]
Huh...

427
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:47,124
(panicked stare)

428
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,926
Omph!

429
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,928
Ow.

430
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:26,524
[SHOYO]
What's the King of the Court
doing at this school?! Maybe
it's somebody else?

431
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,127
Yeah, that's it! Someone who
looks just like him... and
happens to be in the gym...

432
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:33,397
and happens to play
volleyball... No way, get real!

433
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:37,201
[SHOYO]
Next Haikyu: "The Volleyball
Club of Karasuno High."

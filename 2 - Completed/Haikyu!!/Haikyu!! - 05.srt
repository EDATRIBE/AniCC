1
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:13,907
[TOBIO, internal]
Be extra alert.
Ball... blocker... spiker.

2
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,675
Observe every single move.

3
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:23,850
[TOBIO, internal]
Line up your timing with
the spiker's optimum
hitting height...

4
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,484
[TOBIO, internal]
And shoot!

5
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,220
(surprised)

6
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:29,288
Wow.

7
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:30,423
They did it again!

8
00:00:30,523 --> 00:00:31,925
[HISASHI]
They turned it around!

9
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:35,361
One more point and they're
gonna take the first set.

10
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:37,530
His timing's better...

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,632
It's improving by the second!

12
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:44,037
[KOSHI]
Impressive, this must be
Kageyama's setting ability
at its best!

13
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:47,506
[SHOYO] Yeah!
[RYUNOSUKE] Yeah! That
was freakin' perfect!

14
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:50,476
[KOSHI] But the person who
brought it out of him...
was Hinata.
[SHOYO] Thanks!

15
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:54,413
[SHOYO] (laugh)
Alright! We're on a roll!

16
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,844
(whistle)

17
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:33,512
[KOSHI, internal]
The kid does have some patience.

18
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,548
[SHOYO] (smacked in the face)
[TOBIO] Oops.

19
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,318
[KOSHI, internal]
I've never seen anybody take
a set directly to the face
before...

20
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:42,055
[KEI] You're not getting past me
this time, kid!
[KOSHI] (surprised)

21
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:49,062
Oh really?

22
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:54,500
Yikes... He'd better keep
a close eye on Tanaka too.

23
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,303
(set ending whistle)

24
00:02:57,403 --> 00:02:58,838
Dammit.

25
00:02:58,938 --> 00:03:00,907
Ohhh! You like that?

26
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:04,410
'Sup, Tsukishima?! Not talkin'
so big anymore, huh?!

27
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,079
[SHOYO]
Yeah, what he said!

28
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:08,414
[RYUNOSUKE]
Ooh, I wish you'd
try something, boy!

29
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:10,884
[SHOYO] Yeah, go ahead and try!
(RYUNOSUKE growling)

30
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:14,253
[KOSHI] Why are you doing more
trash talking than Hinata is?
[RYUNOSUKE] Huh?

31
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:17,523
Exactly! Without the
first‐years, you never
would have made that hit!

32
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:19,058
Yeah, don't get
all cocky!

33
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,493
Keep your clothes on!

34
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,061
Look, I don't need any
more smart remarks

35
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:25,064
from the peanut gallery!
[CHIKARA KOSHI] (surprised)

36
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,400
[HISASHI]
You know... Tsukishima's
team doesn't have

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,502
a lot of initiative
on their side...

38
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:34,007
So the best thing they can do
is try to block all those
aggressive attacks.

39
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:35,809
(whistle)

40
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:38,677
[KAZUHITO] Time for the second
set!

41
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:39,445
Ready!

42
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:40,880
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Yeah!

43
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:49,856
[TOBIO] Alright!

44
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,559
(smacked) (fall down)

45
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:58,031
[RYUNOSUKE] (stumble)

46
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,068
(determined)

47
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:10,309
[RYUNOSUKE]
Not today! Suck it, nerds!

48
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,478
[SHOYO TOBIO] (panting)
[HISASHI] Whoa...

49
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:19,285
Kageyama's pretty amazing. And
man, all those precision sets!
He's really gotta stay focused.

50
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:23,089
Not to mention Hinata's running
around even more than usual.

51
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:26,059
Yeah... but...

52
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:29,662
[DAICHI] (slide)

53
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:31,831
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Yesss!

54
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,500
They're having fun.

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,335
(whistle)

56
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:39,672
[SHOYO TOBIO]
(heavy breathing)

57
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:42,408
[KOSHI]
Good game!

58
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:45,745
[DAICHI] (gulp) Hm?
[RYUNOSUKE] Hey... Quick
question, you guys.

59
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:52,185
After what you both said
before, it's like you already
knew they were able to master
that move... You're telepathic?!

60
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:53,920
[DAICHI KOSHI]
Huh?

61
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,955
Let them work on a few
combinations,

62
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:58,157
and Karasuno will
have the perfect team!

63
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:02,195
It's up to you to use his
talents more effectively!

64
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:04,563
What?! That is ridiculous!

65
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:08,935
All I was telling Kageyama to do
was start setting Hinata up with
something he could hit!

66
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:12,271
Yeah, sorry... I'm afraid
I'm not a psychic either...

67
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,174
I just thought Hinata could
adapt to his crazy sets.

68
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,945
Anyway... I gotta
admit I'm happy.

69
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:19,713
(confused) What?

70
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:21,981
(heavy breathing)

71
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:26,552
[DAICHI]
Basically... I was hoping for
something like THIS...

72
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:29,889
...and it turned into THIS.

73
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:34,227
[DAICHI]
He may be green, but
Hinata's got raw speed
and jumping power...

74
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:38,998
Kageyama's advanced
techniques are a perfect
complement to that.

75
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:43,402
And When you pair them up,
they bring out the best in
each other.

76
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:46,039
[DAICHI] Turns out... we got
even better results
[TOBIO] Just forget it...
Nobody cares.

77
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,776
[DAICHI] than I had hoped for.
[SHOYO] It's important,
okay? See? Look.

78
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:50,877
[SHOYO]
Tsukishima!

79
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:52,245
[TADASHI]
Huh?

80
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,715
[KEI]
What now?

81
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,752
You're supposed to shake hands
before and after a game...

82
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:00,920
I guess we sorta skipped the
first one...

83
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,123
And even though I may not
really like this at all...

84
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:05,691
you're my teammate now.

85
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:08,027
(annoyed)

86
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,297
Just do it! Hey look,
I know it's awkward...

87
00:06:11,397 --> 00:06:16,736
but take it from me, if you
can't play nice with your
teammates, these guys'll kick
you right out of the gym!

88
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:19,839
Look, I know I wasn't around
when it happened or anything...

89
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:24,177
but I'm pretty sure that was
because you disobeyed the
captain, picked a fight...

90
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:26,345
AND knocked the Vice
Principal's toupee off.

91
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:27,781
[SHOYO TOBIO]
(startled)

92
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,850
Y‐you don't have to
get into the details.

93
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,451
[SHOYO]
Shake my hand!
(jumping, roughhousing)

94
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:35,755
[KEI]
Hey! Gghh... Stop
that, you idiot!

95
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:38,691
So dramatic...
First‐years, right?

96
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:41,660
[KEI] (horrified)
[TADASHI] I am SO sorry
that happened!

97
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:43,662
[DAICHI]
Tsukishima.

98
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:47,934
So what'd you think?
Did you have some fun?

99
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,103
It wasn't a big deal?

100
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,438
They've got a star from a great
school...

101
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:56,910
A bunch of lowly commoners
like us never even stood a
chance and you know it.

102
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,845
[DAICHI]
Really?

103
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:00,780
It seemed like a
big deal to you.

104
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,517
You fought pretty hard
out there... Here.

105
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:07,186
(annoyed)

106
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,457
[SHOYO]
Captain!

107
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,458
[TADASHI KEI]
(startled) Hm?

108
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:13,893
[DAICHI]
(startled) Yes?

109
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:26,005
[DAICHI] Kiyoko! They
should be here, right?

110
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:27,306
Hm? Mm‐hm...

111
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,643
Huh? What?

112
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,915
[SHOYO]
Hm?

113
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:40,219
[SHOYO] WHOAAAA!
[TOBIO] (startled)

114
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,388
(excited laughter)

115
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:45,258
I'm fairly sure I got the
right sizes for you...

116
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:47,560
Let me know if you
need replacements.

117
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,762
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Thanks!

118
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:50,897
Go ahead, why don't
you try it on?

119
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:52,298
I can just try
it on later‐

120
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:55,501
Put it on, bro! Get over
yourself, would ya?

121
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:59,672
(KEI annoyed)
(EVERYONE chanting)
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

122
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:01,507
[KOSHI RYUNOSUKE]
Whoa!

123
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:05,211
(SHOYO containing excitement)

124
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:08,314
(SHOYO excited prancing)
[RYUNOSUKE] Whooaa Lookin'
good, my man!

125
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:10,583
[KOSHI]
Yeah, I agree, it
really suits you!

126
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:14,620
[DAICHI] On behalf of the
Karasuno Volleyball Club...
[RYUNOSUKE KOSHI TADASHI] Hm?

127
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,789
[DAICHI] Welcome...

128
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,390
[ALL]
...to the team!

129
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,959
[TADASHI SHOYO TOBIO]
(moved)

130
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,463
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Thanks!

131
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,134
[DAICHI] (sigh)
[RYUNOSUKE] Hey, strike a pose!

132
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:29,703
[DAICHI] Well, that's
the first step.
[SHOYO] Like this?

133
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,537
[RYUNOSUKE]
Not bad! Now try this way! Bah!

134
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,139
[DAICHI] I take it you
and Tanaka gave those two
[SHOYO] Yeah, Like that?

135
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,708
[DAICHI] a little extra
help, didn't you?

136
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:36,509
[KOSHI]
Huh?! No.. Why would
you think that?!

137
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:39,012
[DAICHI] Anyway, for
now, I'm just glad
[RYUNOSUKE] Now we're talkin'!

138
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:41,314
[DAICHI] everything worked
out... Thanks a lot, you two.
[RYUNOSUKE] At this rate
we could start

139
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:43,482
[RYUNOKSUKE] a badass
volleyball street gang!
[KOSHI KIYOKO] Hm?

140
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:45,952
[KOSHI KIYOKO]
Good work.

141
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:47,253
[DAICHI] (shocked)
I didn't do anything.

142
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:50,757
Hey, Hinata! Less talking,
more practicing!

143
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:54,293
[TOBIO]
Let's run through the quick
attack again while you're
still remembering how!

144
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:55,628
[SHOYO]
Okay!

145
00:08:55,729 --> 00:08:57,563
[TOBIO]
Throw the ball over here,
Tanaka!

146
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,498
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh?! Aren't you guys tired?!

147
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:01,334
[TAKEDA] (running)
(door opening)

148
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,903
[TAKEDA]
Hey! We got it!
We got something!

149
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:06,239
(TAKEDA panting)
[TOBIO SHOYO] Huh?

150
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,610
A practice game! With one
of the area's top 4!
Aoba‐Johsai High School!

151
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:12,812
Those guys?!

152
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:14,613
[KEI] Come on...
[TADASHI] No way.

153
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:16,883
We get to play against
one of the top 4?!

154
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:19,118
Aoba‐Johsai, huh?

155
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:24,924
[TAKEDA]
Oh, it's you two! You must be
Hinata and Kageyama, right?

156
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:27,326
Uh... Who's that?

157
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:28,795
No idea.

158
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:30,864
My name's Ittetsu Takeda...

159
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:32,732
Your club advisor.

160
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:33,967
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Hey.

161
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:35,802
I'm clueless about this game...

162
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:37,670
so I can't coach you
on your technique...

163
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:41,640
But I promise I'll try to
help you guys out wherever
I can.. okay?

164
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:43,276
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Uh, sure.

165
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:45,411
So what's up?

166
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,780
Oh yeah, the game...

167
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,215
Aoba Johsai, or Seijoh,
as some people call it,

168
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:51,150
was the only school
who said yes.

169
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,988
That's crazy! So how'd you get a
game with a team like them?

170
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,856
Wait, did you
beg again?

171
00:09:56,956 --> 00:09:58,491
No, not this time!

172
00:09:58,591 --> 00:09:59,793
I AM good at begging...

173
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:01,527
but I didn't have to.

174
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:02,361
(relieved sighs)

175
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,529
Although...

176
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:04,731
there is one
little condition.

177
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:06,099
What's that?

178
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,734
[TAKEDA]
Kageyama has to be the setter

179
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,769
for the whole game.
[TOBIO] (surprised)

180
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,404
Huh?

181
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:13,072
What the hell is that?!

182
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:15,508
So they're not interested in
playing against Karasuno,

183
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:18,144
but they've got some kinda
special beef with Kageyama, huh?

184
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:21,480
What are we, just a joke to
them? What's their deeeeal?

185
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,851
(nervous) Um... No... I don't
think that's the case...

186
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,486
[KOSHI]
Let's do it... It's an
opportunity.

187
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:32,425
You sure about this, Suga?!
You're the official setter..
Doesn't this bug you, man?!

188
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:37,330
[KOSHI]
Well... It's a chance for
us to use Hinata's and
Kageyama's attack...

189
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,967
Now we can see how good it
truly measures up against
a really good team.

190
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:42,668
(surprised)

191
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,438
(unsure)

192
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,673
Okay... what are
the details, then?

193
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:52,846
Well uh... let's see...
The schedule's a little tight,
but it's next Tuesday.

194
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:56,415
[TAKEDA]
There's only time for the one
game since it's after school.

195
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:58,617
[SHOYO] It's a real game!
[TAKEDA] We'll borrow a school
bus and head straight there

196
00:10:58,718 --> 00:11:01,554
[SHOYO] A real freakin' game!
My very first one
[TAKEDA] after homeroom's over,

197
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:04,791
[SHOYO] since I came to Karasuno
High and joined the team!
[TAKEDA] so make sure you have
all your stuff ready to go.

198
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:06,325
[TAKEDA] Don't be late.

199
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:07,593
[ALL]
Right!

200
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:13,199
[KAZUHITO]
Good work, guys!

201
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,968
[CHIKARA HISASHI]
Thanks!

202
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:19,305
[TOBIO]
Suga!

203
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:19,973
[KOSHI] Huh?

204
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:22,375
(TOBIO panting)

205
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:30,349
I know it's not fair... that
I'll be in the starting
line‐up...

206
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:33,052
but I promise to you I'll
earn my spot from now on!

207
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:34,587
[KOSHI] What?
[TOBIO] (confused)

208
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:37,423
Oh.. Sorry... I guess
I'm just surprised

209
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:40,860
that you care how I feel about
the whole thing.. That's all.

210
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,229
Hm? I don't follow.

211
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,165
[KOSHI]
You've got more stamina and
raw talent than me anyway‐

212
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:51,204
Who cares?! That's great and
all, but they're not the same as
having experience! Besides...

213
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:53,907
[DAICHI RYUNOSUKE] Suga!
[SHOYO] Sugawara!

214
00:11:55,541 --> 00:12:01,414
Um... you see, the rest of
the team... um... they...
well, they trust you.

215
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:07,186
[KOSHI, internal] (startled)
Whoa... That one bad game in
middle school must have really
screwed with his head...

216
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:10,990
[TOBIO]
Anyway... I swear...
I won't lose!

217
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:14,660
Yeah... I'll do my best too.

218
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:19,232
(SHOYO laughing)
[RYUNOSUKE] Hey Suga! Daichi
said he was gonna treat us to
some food!

219
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:21,334
[KOSHI] So
uh, I was thinking...

220
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:25,839
[KOSHI]
Most players from Kitagawa First
end up going to Aoba‐Johsai High
School, right?

221
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:27,774
[TOBIO]
Yeah, as far as I know.

222
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:32,779
[SHOYO, internal]
Does that mean we'll be up
against Kageyama's old
teammates?

223
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,582
Yeah, that's what I thought...
So, uh, you think you're gonna
be okay with that.

224
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:40,954
Huh? Well, I guess it
might be weird if we
were on the same team.

225
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:45,158
But since we're opponents,
I'll fight them with
everything I've got.

226
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:47,761
Okay... Good to hear.

227
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:48,995
[TOBIO] Thanks.

228
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:50,764
Are you sure you're okay
with this, Suga?

229
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:54,467
I mean, c'mon... How can you
just sit here and take this?!

230
00:12:54,567 --> 00:13:00,439
(sad smile) I'm not thrilled
about it... but...

231
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,375
We gotta show those guys how
much Kageyama's changed

232
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:05,411
since middle school...
It'll be fine.

233
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:06,980
[DAICHI] That's right.
[RYUNOSUKE KOSHI TOBIO] Hm?

234
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,181
[SHOYO]
(happy) (thrilled)

235
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:09,716
And Kageyama's not
the only one of us

236
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:13,419
that they'll have to watch
out for. Right, Hinata?

237
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:17,656
[SHOYO] (mouthful)
Sorry, what was that?

238
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:20,593
[RYUNOSUKE]
Why are you stuffing your face
before the rest of us?!

239
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:21,895
[TOBIO] You're such a pig!

240
00:13:21,995 --> 00:13:23,062
[KEISHIN]
Hey, volleyball loser!

241
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:25,331
No fighting in
front of my store!

242
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:28,167
[BOTH] Sorry, sir.
[SHOYO] (dropped)

243
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:31,637
[SHOYO, internal]
That's right... we're the
volleyball club!

244
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:36,009
Everyone here is a part of the
same group. The same team.

245
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:40,313
Wow, thanks... Any
curry buns in there?

246
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:42,849
Save some room for
dinner, would ya?

247
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:45,251
Hey! Come get your food!

248
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:47,053
[TADASHI]
Thank you!

249
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:50,156
[SHOYO, internal]
We are a team!

250
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:54,728
[DAICHI]
Kageyama, could I have a word?

251
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:56,329
[TOBIO] Uh, sure.

252
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:58,364
[KEISHIN] Keep the noise down.
[KOSHI] Okay.

253
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:02,135
I've been brainstorming about
what Hinata's position should be
for the practice game.

254
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:04,437
[DAICHI] What do you think?

255
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:06,139
Well...

256
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:24,690
[DAICHI]
Let's talk positions
for the practice game.

257
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,093
Here's the plan I came up with.

258
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,866
[DAICHI]
I'd like to have you
two work as a pair.

259
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,333
[SHOYO TOBIO, internal]
A pair?

260
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,402
[DAICHI]
And Tsukishima is
our tallest player,

261
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,573
so I want to see how much
of an advantage that gives
us over Seijoh.

262
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:42,275
Fiiiiine.

263
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,643
[TADASHI, internal]
All the other first‐years
are special...

264
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:48,014
Wait, why is Hinata in the one
position that needs a tall guy?!

265
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:52,786
Huh?! He's right; why are
Tsukishima and I both playing
the middle blocker position?!

266
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:56,522
Time out... I‐I think I
need to do a quick review
of all the positions.

267
00:14:56,622 --> 00:15:03,596
[TAKEDA]
The setter... That's the control
tower, the one who sets people
up and starts the attacks.

268
00:15:03,697 --> 00:15:10,636
The wing spiker... He's the
all‐rounder that sort of
maintains the balance between
offense and defense.

269
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:16,910
The middle blockers... They
block the other team's attacks
and score points using quick
attacks.

270
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,714
They also act as a decoy to lead
the opposing blockers astray.

271
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:22,448
Does that sound about right?

272
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,284
Well, there's another one that
specializes in defense...

273
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,286
but we'll skip
that part for now.

274
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,388
[TOBIO]
Listen up, Hinata.

275
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,425
Let's call you...
Number One Decoy!

276
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:38,031
[SHOYO]
YEAAAAHHH! I'm the
number one... decoy?

277
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:41,600
(dejected)
Man, that sounds lame.

278
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:43,870
We'll use you as a distraction
while we rake in points.

279
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,207
We'll be using quick attacks...
That way, the other spikers can
do some damage!

280
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:49,575
[SHOYO] Huh?!?

281
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:52,078
You take the tall
Tsukishima guys...

282
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:56,482
But you can lead them
right into our trap like
the idiots they are.

283
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,284
How cool is that?

284
00:15:58,384 --> 00:16:01,354
(excited)
That sounds so awesome!

285
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:04,657
Hey! You better not be
implying Tsukki's an idiot!

286
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:06,292
Shut up, Tadashi.

287
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:07,827
Oh, sorry, Tsukki.

288
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,328
[TOBIO]
On the other hand,

289
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,663
if you're not at the
top of your game,

290
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:13,566
then all our other
attacks will fall apart.

291
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,701
(gulp)

292
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:16,102
Stop it!

293
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:18,104
You're gonna put too
much pressure on him.

294
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:20,606
Don't fall apart...
Don't fall apart...

295
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:23,877
Don't fall apart...
Don't fall apart...
[DAICHI] You broke him!

296
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:27,013
Yeah, but blocking is the
most important thing here.

297
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:30,249
[RYUNOSUKE]
No matter how high he can jump,
he's still a shorty pants...

298
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:34,587
By the time he gets to his
highest point, the taller
guys'll already be there.

299
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:38,557
[TOBIO]
Already thought of that. Hinata
won't be focusing on blocking...

300
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:42,461
Instead of trying to slap
down a spike, he can just
give it a tap...

301
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:46,499
We'll use his ridiculously
fast reflexes to their
fullest potential.

302
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:51,304
[TOBIO]
If he taps an enemy spike, it
should slow down enough.

303
00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:54,741
[DAICHI] I got it!
[TOBIO] Then we just collect
the ball and counterattack.

304
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:57,711
You think he can pull that
off without practice?

305
00:16:57,811 --> 00:16:59,713
[DAICHI] I doubt it.
[RYUNOSUKE] Huh?

306
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:01,981
Well, not on the
first try at least.

307
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:05,985
But you know, sometimes the
attempt is what really what
matters...

308
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,254
It is a practice game, right?

309
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:09,789
Right.

310
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:12,691
Besides... The only ones on
our team who can beat him

311
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:16,763
in airborne combat are
Tsukishima and Kageyama.

312
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:19,432
So I just want you
to do your best.

313
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:21,267
RIGHT! I won't mess up!

314
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,436
I'll earn lots of points and
be the perfect decoy!

315
00:17:23,536 --> 00:17:25,371
I'll serve, I'll block, I'll do
quick attacks,

316
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:27,907
whatever else you want
me to do! Wahhh!
[DAICHI] Whoa! Hinata,
calm down!

317
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:30,276
[DAICHI]
We've lost him! I think
he just short‐circuited!

318
00:17:30,376 --> 00:17:33,379
[RYUNOSUKE] (freak out)
Oh crap, we killed him!

319
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:39,485
(school bell ringing)

320
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:41,620
[YUI]
Huh?! Daichi!

321
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:44,690
Huh? Hey, Michimiya...
What's up?

322
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:49,328
Are you guys really
playing Seijoh tomorrow?
That's so weird.

323
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:53,299
[DAICHI]
(laugh) Yeah, Takeda really
worked hard to get that matchup.

324
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:55,368
Aren't you nervous?
Huh?

325
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:58,872
It's just that those guys were
in the top 4 in the whole
prefecture last year...

326
00:17:58,972 --> 00:18:01,374
Don't you think they'll
wipe the floor with you?

327
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:06,612
[DAICHI]
(chuckle) You just think that
because you haven't seen these
crazy first‐years we just got.

328
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:08,815
[YUI] Hm? Oh, I heard!
[DAICHI] (surprised)

329
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:11,951
They're the ones who knocked the
Vice Principal's toupee off his
head the first d‐

330
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,620
[DAICHI]
Ahhh shushushushushush!

331
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:15,755
Ssh!

332
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:16,856
(muffled nod)

333
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:20,526
(sigh) They still have a lot
of work to do...

334
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:26,933
but if they keep trying...
I really believe Karasuno High's
gonna have the perfect
volleyball team one day.

335
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:29,568
Ohhh.

336
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:31,771
[TOBIO]
Are first‐years allowed
in the club room?

337
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:33,940
[KOSHI]
Sure, why wouldn't they be?

338
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:36,843
Good afternoon!

339
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:38,511
[ALL]
Hey, dudes.

340
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,246
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Hey guys.

341
00:18:40,346 --> 00:18:41,815
[SHOYO] (amazed)

342
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:45,952
Yeah, it's not that amazing,
Hinata... It's just a club room.

343
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:49,455
But I've never had a chance to
be in one before! Uh!

344
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:52,191
And I beat this the same one
used by the Tiny Giant.

345
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:56,062
[RYUNOSUKE]
You must be excited about
your debut game tomorrow.

346
00:18:56,162 --> 00:18:59,265
[SHOYO] (startled)
[RYUNOSUKE] Well.. practice
game, but who's to judge!

347
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:02,601
[KOSHI] (listening)
[RYUNOSUKE] Seijoh's gym
is freakin' huge!

348
00:19:02,702 --> 00:19:06,172
[RYUNOSUKE] And their guys
are just as big, so don't
freak out when you see 'em.

349
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:07,173
What's up?

350
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:08,241
Hey.

351
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:09,675
Boss!

352
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:11,244
[SHOYO] No!
[RYUNOSUKE] No?

353
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,479
I'm not gonna freak out, okay?!

354
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,581
I'm gonna play my
best game ever!

355
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:20,453
[RYUNOSUKE]
Uh, dude... You do know your
jacket doesn't belong on your
legs, right?

356
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:23,322
[DAICHI TOBIO] (stunned)
(RYUNOSUKE laughing)

357
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:26,225
[DAICHI] Kageyama... can he
survive tomorrow?
[RYUNOSUKE] Man, you're a mess!

358
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:29,362
[RYUNOSUKE] You're freakin'
out even more than I thought
you would!
[TOBIO] Hm? What do you mean?

359
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:32,031
[DAICHI] The only game
experience he's got is that one
tournament in middle school.

360
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:34,433
[RYUNOSUKE] (laughter)
Seriously, just take a chill
pill, would you?!

361
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,870
[SHOYO] It's not what
it looks like!
[DAICHI] He must
be panicking and

362
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,872
[DAICHI] obsessing pretty
bad over this.
[SHOYO] I did it on purpose,
I swear!

363
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:40,606
[RYUNOSUKE] Doesn't
look like it!
[DAICHI] I'm kinda worried...

364
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:41,875
I hope he'll be okay.

365
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,543
But everybody gets nervous
once in a while.

366
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:49,115
Shame on you! You shouldn't pick
on the poor guy just because he
has a little case of the
first‐time jitters!

367
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:50,683
[TOBIO]
(startled) Huh?!

368
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:54,187
Anything I say to him turns
into more pressure.

369
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:56,422
Hinata... The club room key‐

370
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:58,091
(startled) Y‐yeah sure, I
can take it, no problem!

371
00:19:58,191 --> 00:20:01,260
No, I just wanted to show
you where we keep it.

372
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,163
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm
sorry! I'm sorry! I'm
sorry! I'm sorry!

373
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:07,834
Well, what do you expect
right before his big debut?

374
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:13,206
Yeah, it's probably best
to leave him alone.

375
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:14,974
Probably.

376
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:19,012
[SHOYO, internal]
I have to be on top
of it tomorrow!

377
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:23,682
It's not middle school or
the 3‐on‐3 game anymore.
If I suck...

378
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,519
[SHOYO]
They'll just replace me!

379
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:30,123
(internal) Agh, no! I can't
get swapped out!

380
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:34,427
I get to stand in the court
with some big‐time volleyball
players!

381
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,896
I want to stay in
for the whole game!

382
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:37,964
(stomach gurgling)

383
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,672
[SHOYO]
I can't mess this up.. I can't
mess this up.. I can't mess this
up... (bumped)

384
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:50,376
Oh, I'm sorry, you're just so
short, I didn't see you there.

385
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:52,011
(snickering)

386
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:54,147
[SHOYO] Oh... yeah.

387
00:20:54,247 --> 00:21:00,486
[BOTH] Uh?
[SHOYO] I can't mess this up...
I can't mess this up... I can't
mess this up...

388
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:01,955
What's with him?

389
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,122
Beats me.

390
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,624
[KOSHI]
By the way... Could
you do us a favor

391
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:07,894
and take a break from
messing with Hinata.
[RYUNOSUKE] Hey, I
can't find my jersey!

392
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:12,999
[KOSHI] You're pressuring him.
[TOBIO] (taken aback)
Messing with him?

393
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:17,270
[TOBIO, internal]
When have I ever
messed with him?

394
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,973
I think I'd remember that.

395
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:21,207
(TOBIO thinking)

396
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:23,142
[ALL, internal]
He doesn't know...

397
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,378
[RYUNOSUKE]
(running) Hinata!

398
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:28,614
(GIRL startled)
[RYUNOSUKE] Are you wearing
my uniform pants, you little
doofus?! (growl)

399
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:32,786
[SHOYO] Huh?
[GIRL] Tanaka, you pervert,
put some pants on!

400
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:35,388
[RYUNOSUKE] Huh?!
[GIRL] God, you
are such a creep!

401
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:37,556
(RYUNOSUKE embarrassed)
[TOBIO] Hm?

402
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:39,826
(dogs barking)

403
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:47,633
Darn iiiiiit!

404
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,335
[SHOYO]
I can't sleep!

405
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:51,905
But I gotta get some rest before
the game tomorrowwwwww!

406
00:21:52,005 --> 00:21:53,639
What do I dooo‐

407
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,341
[NATSU] Shut up, Shoyo!

408
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:56,910
[SHOYO]
(surprised) Uh, sorry...

409
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,677
(NATSU annoyed)

410
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:15,428
[TAKEDA]
Ready?

411
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:17,263
[ALL]
Ready!

412
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:18,865
[TAKEDA] Good!

413
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:23,937
(laughter) Hey, Hinata, you
should have a little snack!

414
00:22:24,037 --> 00:22:27,340
(worried) Whoa! You
don't look so good, pal!

415
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,344
Huh? Oh no, I'm fine, I just
didn't sleep much last night...

416
00:22:31,444 --> 00:22:32,712
(about to puke)

417
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:36,649
Sorry... Do you... mind
if I open the wi‐ (gag)

418
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,855
(SHOYO hurls)
[RYUNOSUKE] (scream) STOP THE
BUS! STOP THE BUS RIGHT NOW!

419
00:22:41,955 --> 00:22:44,123
[SHOYO] (sick)
[RYUNOSUKE] (freaking out)

420
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:45,224
[DAICHI]
Did he...

421
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:46,259
[KOSHI]
Uh‐huh...

422
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,627
[TOBIO]
We're in trouble.

423
00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:52,699
[DAICHI KOSHI TOBIO]
Oh no...

424
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:26,125
[KOSHI]
Is he gonna be okay, Daichi?

425
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,460
[DAICHI]
Uh, yeah...

426
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,128
[KOSHI]
Wow, you don't look too hot.

427
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:31,564
[DAICHI]
Yeah, I think the smell is
making me sick too... (gag)

428
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:33,666
[KOSHI]
Oh god, open all
the windows, now!

429
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:37,036
[KOSHI]
Next Haikyu!

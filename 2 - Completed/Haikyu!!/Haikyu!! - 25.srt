1
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:10,234
[Shiratorizawa Crowd]:
Shiiiiiiratorizawa!

2
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:13,271
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

3
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:19,143
This is going to be the
day that I humiliate you

4
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:22,246
once and for all...
Are you ready big guy?

5
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:26,117
I would rather you drop
the nicknames, Oikawa.

6
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:28,386
(starting whistle)

7
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,660
[Student 1]:
I'm starving!

8
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,228
[Student 2]:
Lunch time!

9
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:39,798
Hey Hinata, I'm really hungry!
It's time to eat.

10
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:41,499
Mhmm.

11
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:46,404
I heard you guys played
a close game yesterday.

12
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:49,440
Yeah, man, our team lost in the
third round last week also...

13
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:53,812
The guys who beat us made
it all the way to Nationals.

14
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:56,480
What's wrong?
You okay?

15
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:58,182
Bathroom.

16
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:06,490
[Ryunosuke]:
When Hinata and Kageyama first
came to the volleyball club...

17
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:08,593
Daichi told us that
we would be going

18
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:10,294
to the Spring
Nationals.

19
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:12,396
Spring Nationals...

20
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:14,733
First qualifier's
in August, right?

21
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,336
Yeah, that's right...
He said we'd go back there.

22
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:22,907
There's no time to
lick our wounds, boys.

23
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:27,546
[Daichi]:
Hey... I think this might be a
good time for me to retire.

24
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,349
Ever since third‐years
were allowed to play

25
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,317
in the Spring Nationals...

26
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:36,154
I've wanted us to survive
to the finals and go to Tokyo

27
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:38,523
so we could do that.

28
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,759
But...

29
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:42,426
[Daichi]:
now that I've seen
those incredible

30
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:44,663
first and second‐years
in action,

31
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:47,065
I feel like it might be
better to give up the club

32
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:49,433
to them early.

33
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:52,170
It's better to restructure
the team around them,

34
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,205
since they have so
much potential.

35
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,107
I just think I ought
to step aside and‐

36
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:59,544
[Koshi]:
Daichi. Is that really
what you want to do?

37
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:02,547
I know being the
captain means

38
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,315
you have to make the
tough decisions...

39
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:07,719
but it doesn't do any good to
remove yourself completely.

40
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,822
It's one thing if that
was your plan from the start.

41
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:12,223
[Koshi]:
But come on...

42
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:15,093
you shouldn't just leave
because of the new guys!

43
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:19,497
I will stay like
I said I would!

44
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:22,133
And I'm not going anywhere
unless the younger members

45
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,434
ask me to leave!

46
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:25,904
Whether you
two stay or not!

47
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:28,106
I told you yesterday
I'm still in!

48
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:30,008
[Asahi]:
I'm not going to
college anyway...

49
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:33,645
I guess if the underclassmen
didn't want me to stay I'd go,

50
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:35,446
but... I... I...

51
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:37,215
[Daichi]:
Look!

52
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:41,419
I still... I still want to stay!

53
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,557
I love this game...
you know that, don't you?!

54
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,637
[Teacher]:
Mr. Takeda?

55
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:01,873
May I have a word with you
about volleyball club?

56
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:03,642
Okay.

57
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:05,169
[Shimada]:
So, you actually got to play.

58
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,071
How was it?

59
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:09,641
Did you enjoy
it, Tadashi?

60
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:14,278
No...

61
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,280
No!

62
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,118
I thought as much.

63
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:23,421
In the moment, you tense up and
can't move the way you want.

64
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,489
Then the ball doesn't
fly right...

65
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,559
That's no fun at all.

66
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:31,630
When I was younger, I used to
like playing volleyball

67
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,165
because it was just a fun thing
I could do with my friends,

68
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:35,333
you know?

69
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:38,202
That's all this game
was to me...

70
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:42,473
But I was wrong;
it's not like that at all.

71
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:45,409
I can't do what
those other guys do.

72
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:52,416
[Tadashi]:
I want to control my body!
I want to control the ball!

73
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:56,254
I want what it takes
to stand up to my opponents!

74
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:01,425
"If you really want to get the
most out of playing sports,

75
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:03,562
then you have to be strong."

76
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,131
[Shimada]:
Coach Ukai...

77
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:08,767
The older version...

78
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:11,235
That's the advice
he would always give me.

79
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:12,671
I wasn't his star ace...

80
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,239
in fact, wasn't even in
the starting lineup.

81
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:16,608
I practiced hard though,

82
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,544
and sometimes I felt
like throwing in the towel.

83
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:21,713
But...

84
00:08:25,684 --> 00:08:27,819
[Shimada]:
The first time I nailed
a service ace

85
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,754
during a real game....

86
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:33,291
I realized... wow,
this is the play I spent

87
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:35,894
all those long
hours practicing for.

88
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:39,698
That day, I decided to buckle
down and work even harder,

89
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,133
just to see if I could
experience that game,

90
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:45,403
that point, that moment,
all over again.

91
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,810
Well then...
Let's work!

92
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,413
The next game will be
here before you know it.

93
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,752
Tsukki! Are you
ready for lunch?

94
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:03,655
Please not so
loud, Tadashi.

95
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:08,927
Sorry, Tsukki!
Tsukki!

96
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:12,764
[Teacher]:
I received statements from
both Sugawara and Sawamura

97
00:09:12,864 --> 00:09:14,766
that they'd be staying
in volleyball club

98
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:18,302
past the Inter‐High despite
their plans to attend college.

99
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:20,739
But then, Sugawara...

100
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,341
Excuse me.

101
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:27,445
[Teacher]:
Young man.

102
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:28,880
I understand your feelings,

103
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,616
but you really should
prioritize your studies.

104
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:34,052
If you ask me, you don't
stand to gain anything

105
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:36,354
by staying in the club.

106
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:38,890
Maybe not... but...

107
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,794
I don't play volleyball
just to get ahead, y'know?

108
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:44,062
If I'm not mistaken,

109
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:46,831
Sugawara's not part of
your starting lineup, right?

110
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:48,099
Umm... no.

111
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:50,635
And I doubt he can
get a sports scholarship.

112
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:53,872
As it stands right now, he
and Sawamura both tend to get

113
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:56,941
excellent grades.. but can
they maintain those grades?

114
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,911
[Teacher]:
Therefore, I'd like you
to speak to those two.

115
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:02,080
And focus on their
futures rather

116
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,683
than their current
feelings on the matter.

117
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:07,185
I don't want an adult
talking them out

118
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:09,053
of what's best for them.

119
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,292
[Takinoue]:
Poor kids...

120
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:15,694
Yeah what about em?

121
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:18,930
You know... I bet
they're really bummed.

122
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,900
That's why I gave 'em the
whole day off from practice.

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,903
Can't believe it
was just yesterday.

124
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,845
Aoba‐Johsai... They're
pretty good, huh?

125
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:37,882
Damn right they are...
They played a great game.

126
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:40,785
I mean, we were on fire,
don't get me wrong...

127
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:43,555
But to tell you the truth, I'm
not so sure we can pull that off

128
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:46,057
the next time we have to
play against those guys.

129
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:49,493
And even if we do, it's not
like Seijoh's gonna be any less

130
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:51,663
killer than they
were yesterday.

131
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:53,865
Did you notice how they
did their time‐outs?

132
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:58,469
[Takinoue]:
Uh‐huh. It was mostly just a
meeting between the players.

133
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,506
I mean, the coaches
watched from a distance.

134
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:04,442
Well, I'm sure
they helped a little.

135
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:09,013
Seijoh's guys are always
thinking and adapting

136
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:11,650
to every situation they're
faced within a game.

137
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,118
No matter what kind of
weapon we throw at 'em...

138
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:16,254
they've always got something
to counter it with.

139
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:19,624
Yeah, they refused to be
tripped up by anything we did.

140
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:21,693
It was pretty stressful
for me to watch.

141
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:25,997
[Keishin]:
You know... I think there's only
one team who has what it takes

142
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:29,801
to pry the points away from a
well‐oiled machine like Seijoh.

143
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:39,811
And that's Shiratorizawa.

144
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,050
[Toru]:
After all the practicing and
planning and strategizing...

145
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,021
all it's taking is
sheer force to tear us apart.

146
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:54,158
Oh well. It doesn't matter HOW
the victory's won, right?

147
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:58,830
'Cause the loser... is the
one who lets the ball drop.

148
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,633
[Toru]:
That's what counts.

149
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:19,343
Here's the thing...

150
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:21,746
If you sustained an injury
and it wasn't given

151
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:23,882
the proper amount
of time to heal...

152
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:26,384
Because you wanted to keep
playing since your time here

153
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:29,654
[Takeda]:
was limited, I'd
have to stop you.

154
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:33,357
Some things can't be done
no matter how you feel.

155
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:36,160
You four still have some time
before graduation...

156
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,698
The good news is...
you have some options.

157
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:42,601
Now... neglecting and failing
your entrance exams

158
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,368
is not one of them!

159
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:46,070
To overcome your obstacles...

160
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,841
it takes patience and hard
work... sometimes sacrifice.

161
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:53,044
[Takeda]:
Every hour you spend
on your extracurriculars

162
00:13:53,144 --> 00:13:55,914
is time that other students
will spend studying

163
00:13:56,014 --> 00:13:58,149
and preparing
for the workforce.

164
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:00,451
That's going to cause
a disparity.

165
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:05,056
It might not seem like it now,
but one day you may regret it.

166
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,027
So please give
this some thought.

167
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:11,395
[Takeda]:
Try to choose the
option you won't regret

168
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:14,132
5 or 10 years
down the road.

169
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,219
Get lower.

170
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:36,788
Sure thing.

171
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:43,928
Guess the finals are...
almost over with.

172
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:47,298
Yeah...

173
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:50,835
And so whoever wins gets
to go to the Nationals.

174
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:53,905
They get to keep
playing more games.

175
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:57,075
Yeah...

176
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:04,348
It's not FAAAAAIIIR!

177
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,835
Damn...

178
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:28,406
DAMMIT!

179
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,057
I wanna win.

180
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:24,863
I'm never... going to
say I'm sorry again.

181
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:29,167
And I won't make
a set I regret...

182
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:31,803
...not ever!

183
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:41,513
[Shoyo]:
Only the strong...

184
00:16:42,614 --> 00:16:44,482
[Tobio]:
...Stay on the court.

185
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:50,454
Yeah...

186
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:51,856
Right.

187
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,928
Let's do better... now!

188
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:03,034
I think you should
eat lunch first.

189
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:07,205
Ki..Kiyoko!

190
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:10,575
Also, I heard you screaming all
the way in the club room...

191
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,110
So please quiet down.

192
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,377
Oh! Right!

193
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:16,414
[Yu/Ryunosuke]:
Kiyokoooo!

194
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,717
You're looking pretty
as ever today, baby!

195
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:21,219
I think you're prettier
than he does!

196
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,990
[Yu/Ryunosuke]:
I am all yours forever,
my deeeeear!

197
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:29,961
Try not to
hurt yourselves.

198
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:33,397
We're off today. So
why are you guys here?

199
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:36,467
I could ask you two
the same question y'know.

200
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:37,869
[Tadashi]:
Hi!

201
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:41,973
Hey.

202
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:45,109
Welp. We're all
here.... Almost.

203
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:48,346
Well maybe the third‐years
decided not to come back.

204
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,181
Hey, hey, hey!

205
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,551
[Ryunosuke]:
You know they wouldn't leave us
hangin' like that! Ever!

206
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:56,054
Huh? Wait, what does
that mean?! Are they...?!

207
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:59,190
Hey, the third‐years didn't
quit the team, did they?!

208
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,493
They're still going to Spring
Nationals with us, right?!

209
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:11,469
Hurry... we're late!

210
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,106
Yes. They're staying.

211
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:18,543
What kept ya nerds?!

212
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:22,981
Let's do this... okay?

213
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,152
YEAH!

214
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:36,194
Well, here I am. Wonder if
those crazy kids showed up.

215
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,968
[Asahi/Kazuhito]:
Nice kill!

216
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:46,971
You got that one!

217
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:54,145
[Team Karasuno]:
Coach!

218
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:57,481
How 'bout that?
Hard at work, huh?

219
00:18:57,582 --> 00:19:01,419
Thank you sir... We hope that
you will continue coaching us!

220
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,187
Thank you!

221
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:10,128
[Keishin]:
We did the best
we could and lost.

222
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:14,198
Seijoh beat us... That
proves they're the better team.

223
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:18,803
You can like it or not, but
that's what happened out there.

224
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:21,706
I'm sure you're all interested
to know who the winner

225
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:24,075
of the Inter‐High
final was.

226
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:29,914
[Keishin]:
It was Shiratorizawa.

227
00:19:30,014 --> 00:19:32,283
(final whistle)

228
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:34,553
Are you telling me that...

229
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,254
...Seijoh lost?

230
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:47,231
So Seijoh's NOT the best
in our prefecture.

231
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:49,267
We need to step it up!

232
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:53,204
I'm sure you already know
what our next focus is.

233
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:55,039
[Keishin]:
Spring Nationals...

234
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:57,241
And obviously, that'll
be the last game

235
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:59,644
for the third‐year players.

236
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:04,282
I can't wait to play in the
same place the Tiny Giant did!

237
00:20:04,382 --> 00:20:06,985
Actually, I'd like to hear
some inspiring words

238
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:09,120
from the
captain himself.

239
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:16,294
The venue...
is Tokyo's Orange Court.

240
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:19,463
[Daichi]:
Karasuno's only been once.

241
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,768
Let's go back...
and do it again!

242
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:32,210
ALL RIGHT!

243
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,328
[Keishin]:
Take five!

244
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:52,163
[Team Karasuno]:
Yes sir!

245
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:22,393
[Shoyo]:
Kageyama.

246
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:25,063
We're gonna win
it this time.

247
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:26,798
You wait and see.

248
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:30,835
You and me... and our team!

249
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:34,639
Yeah.

250
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:37,341
[Keishin]:
Break time's over, love birds!

251
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:38,577
Sir!

252
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:50,989
[Shoyo]:
There's a big, tall wall in
front of me, blocking my way.

253
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:52,557
[Keishin]:
Practice your spikes!

254
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:54,526
Yes sir!

255
00:21:54,626 --> 00:21:56,995
Here we go!

256
00:21:57,095 --> 00:22:01,099
[Shoyo]:
I'll never be able to see
over that wall on my own,

257
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:04,102
not without
my teammates by my side.

258
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:11,109
You're up next, Ginger!

259
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:12,777
Ready, sir!

260
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,219
[Shoyo]:
Bring it to me!

261
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:31,563
[Shoyo]:
I get it now!
That's the view from the top!

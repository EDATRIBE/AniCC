1
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:08,303
[SHOYO]
Kay! See ya later!

2
00:00:08,403 --> 00:00:10,305
[NATSU] Bye Shoyo...

3
00:00:18,713 --> 00:00:20,215
[SHOYO] (panting)

4
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:22,984
[SHOYO]
We play Nekoma in four days.

5
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,719
[SHOYO]
And I've got new allies!

6
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:29,157
[SHOYO]
That spiker... and that
receiver are both on my side!

7
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:32,126
[SHOYO]
This'll be great!

8
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:33,395
[SHOYO]
I better hurry...

9
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:37,165
It's time for
training camp! Ah‐hahaaa!

10
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:14,696
(SHOYO nervous)

11
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:19,501
[TEACHER]
Mister Hinata... Need a
bathroom break? You can go.

12
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:20,635
(SHOYO embarrassed)

13
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:23,137
(STUDENTS laughing)

14
00:02:23,238 --> 00:02:25,640
[KEISHIN] Everybody here?
[ALL] Yessir!

15
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,943
[KEISHIN]
We've got four days until the
practice game against Nekoma,

16
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:32,013
and after that, it'll be
time for the Inter‐High
preliminaries.

17
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:35,884
[KEISHIN]
Time is short... but we've got
a whole lot of stuff to fix.

18
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:39,888
If you sad sacks expect
to win, there's only one
thing we can do.

19
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:43,892
[KEISHIN]
Practice, practice, practice.

20
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:46,127
I want you to keep
retrieving 'til you puke!

21
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:50,699
[SHOYO] Right!
[RYUNOSUKE KOSHI TOBIO]
(internal) Well, that means
Hinata's done his job.

22
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,602
[KEISHIN]
Forward!

23
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:55,737
(TADASHI fumble)

24
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:57,306
Hey! How many times are

25
00:02:57,406 --> 00:03:00,209
you gonna let me score
on you?! Get serious!

26
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:02,076
[TADASHI]
(determined) One more!

27
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:04,346
[KEISHIN]
Get ready!

28
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:05,780
[DAICHI] Nice receive!
[SHOYO] Good job!

29
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,948
[KIYOKO]
That's five for him...

30
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:08,149
Time to switch out.

31
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,183
[KEISHIN]
Next!

32
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:10,785
I'm ready whenever you are!

33
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:18,527
[KEISHIN]
Good. Alright now let's
work on a few spikes!

34
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:20,061
[ALL]
Right!

35
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:23,031
[RYUNOSUKE]
(battle cry)

36
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:24,433
[SIDELINES]
Nice kill!

37
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,569
[SIDELINES] Nice kill!
[TOBIO] Way to go, guys!

38
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:31,172
[KEISHIN]
Whoaaaa!

39
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:35,510
[KEISHIN]
Yeaaah!

40
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,512
[KEISHIN]
Those spikes are
lookin' good, guys!

41
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:38,780
[KOSHI]
Huh?

42
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:41,683
[TADASHI]
Um... do you mind if I go next?

43
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:43,752
[KOSHI]
Oh! Sure!

44
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:49,858
[DAICHI]
Alright... let's
pack it up guys.

45
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,626
[ALL]
Yessir!

46
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:56,731
[SHOYO]
Uh? Wow! So this
is training camp!

47
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:01,436
[SHOYO] (extreme delight)

48
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:03,538
[TOBIO]
Is it really all
that exciting?

49
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:06,007
Of course it is! I've never
been to a training camp!

50
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:09,378
It's just a bunch of loud,
disgusting guys in your face
all day every day...

51
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:10,912
What's so fun about that?

52
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:12,681
[RYUNOSUKE] You take
that back right now!
(KEI annoyed)

53
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:14,583
[YU]
Yeah, any place within
a quarter‐mile radius

54
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:17,386
of our gorgeous Kiyoko
is automatically pure
and beautiful!

55
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:19,788
This air's as fresh as
a morning in spring!

56
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:24,359
And if your senses are so
dull you can't smell it,
I feel sorry for you!

57
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,195
Kiyoko lives right by here...

58
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:28,763
She goes home whenever
the day's over.

59
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,437
[TAKEDA]
(startled) Should I even
ask what you're doing?

60
00:04:35,537 --> 00:04:41,576
[RYUNOSUKE]
Take... we can't go on...
Goodbye sweet world! Ah?!

61
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:45,247
Huh?

62
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:49,183
[RYUNOSUKE YU]
(adoration)

63
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:51,553
[SHOYO]
(glee)

64
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:54,122
[ALL]
Thanks for the fooo‐oood!

65
00:04:54,223 --> 00:04:56,491
[SHOYO TOBIO]
(ravenous eating)

66
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,860
[KIYOKO]
Does anybody want seconds?

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,094
[RYUNOSUKE YU]
Yes please, Kiyoko!

68
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:02,297
[KIYOKO]
(startled) Wow.

69
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:12,474
[RYUNOSUKE]
Okay... The bath's open for
the first‐years now. Hm?
What's wrong, Hinata?

70
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,010
[SHOYO]
Hey.

71
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,779
[SHOYO]
There's somebody here...

72
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,381
It's a stranger.

73
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,653
Whatever... Don't be ridiculous.

74
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:26,455
[RYUNOSUKE]
We're the only ones here‐

75
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:29,691
[SHOYO]
It's... a child.

76
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,293
(RYUNOSUKE stunned)

77
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:34,128
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nah.. you're seeing things...

78
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:37,999
I'm sure you just walked past a
mirror and saw your reflection.

79
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:43,171
[SHOYO]
Yeah, you're right. That'd
be silly... It's nothing.

80
00:05:43,272 --> 00:05:48,943
[RYUNOSUKE]
Uh‐huh. You've gotta be uh...
just imagining things...

81
00:05:55,617 --> 00:06:00,054
[RYUNOSUKE SHOYO]
(scream) Huh?

82
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:03,792
[YU]
Uh what's with all the racket?
Daichi's gonna get angry y'know.

83
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:08,062
[RYUNOSUKE]
(stunned) It's just
Noya, you idiot.

84
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:11,165
[SHOYO]
Whoa... It IS him!
But he shrank...

85
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:13,668
[SHOYO]
Maybe the ghosts made him
shorter!

86
00:06:14,703 --> 00:06:16,471
[SHOYO] (panic)
[RYUNOSUKE] (laughing)

87
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:19,241
Is that why you have spiky hair,
so you look tall?! Bahaha!

88
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:21,310
[YU]
Dammit, Tanakaaa!

89
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,778
[YU]
Don't make fun of me or I swear‐
(startled)

90
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:27,048
[ASAHI]
You should keep your voices
down. Daichi might hear you‐

91
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:29,218
[SHOYO RYUNOSUKE YU]
(scared) (scream)

92
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:31,453
[ASAHI]
Huh. Guys, it's just me, Asahi!

93
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:34,923
[DAICHI]
All of you, shut up! Shut UP!

94
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:37,292
(SHOYO receive)

95
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:39,961
[KEISHIN]
What are you, a windmill?

96
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:42,030
Move your hands AND your feet!

97
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,233
[SHOYO]
Yes sir! One more!

98
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:47,969
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice, Hinata!

99
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:49,538
[KIYOKO]
That's his fifth one.

100
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:51,440
[KEISHIN]
Good, that should be everybody.

101
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,643
[KEISHIN] Time to
run some laps, guys!
[ALL] Yes sir!

102
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:56,778
[TOBIO] Pick up the pace dude.
[TAKEDA] They sure are full of
energy.

103
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:59,113
[TAKEDA] They even
practice during lunch.
[SHOYO] Jeez, I'm going!

104
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:03,051
[KEISHIN]
Yeah, I noticed that too..
Kageyama gets started early
doesn't he?

105
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:05,654
[TAKEDA]
Right... And Hinata's been doing
the same thing...

106
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:09,624
He said he needs to do that here
since he's not going over the
mountains like he used to.

107
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:14,296
[KEISHIN]
The mountains, huh? That would
explain all that stamina.

108
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,566
[TAKEDA]
On a different note...

109
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,935
Are you having some trouble
choosing the starters?

110
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:23,037
Well just the setter...

111
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:24,773
I'm stuck.

112
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:27,576
[KEISHIN]
If we're talking raw power, it's
gotta be Kageyama...

113
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:30,445
Now you've got Sugawara who's
built up experience

114
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:34,616
from playing alongside the ace
ever since his first year...

115
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,818
[KEISHIN]
...but still, Kageyama's
got enough talent

116
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:39,621
right out of the gate
to make up for all that.

117
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:43,725
[KEISHIN]
Then again, Sugawara's been
around for a while...

118
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:47,329
...so he's probably already got
the trust of his teammates.

119
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:51,933
[TAKEDA]
But that's not really the
heart of the issue, is it?
So could it be that...

120
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:55,804
...you're having trouble
deciding because Sugawara's
a third‐year?

121
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:57,005
(KEISHIN surprised)

122
00:07:57,105 --> 00:07:59,841
[TAKEDA]
Your last year in high
school is special.

123
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:02,110
I can see why you would want
to take that into account.

124
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:05,680
[TAKEDA]
Ah! I'm sorry! I think
I'm overstepping...

125
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,417
[KEISHIN]
No, you're probably right.

126
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:11,786
[KEISHIN]
You know... When I was in high
school,

127
00:08:11,886 --> 00:08:15,257
the only time I got to be in
the starting lineup was when
the official setter

128
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:17,526
‐ who was younger
than me ‐ got hurt.

129
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:22,364
[KEISHIN]
Back then, I was just angry that
I never got the opportunity for
three whole years...

130
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:31,906
But now... as a coach, even a
temporary one... I shouldn't be
thinking like a player. It's not
right.

131
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:38,580
[SHOYO] (dramatic
running groans)
(TOBIO running) (speed up)

132
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,817
[DAICHI]
Hinata!‐ Stop yelling like a
madman; you're gonna need to
save that energy for the game!

133
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:44,586
[TOBIO]
Whoa, where are you going?!

134
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:49,090
(SHOYO grunting and screaming)

135
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,392
Huh?

136
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:56,331
[SHOYO]
Nobody's back there. Is this
path... the wrong way?

137
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,300
(meowing)

138
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,001
Huh?

139
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:08,710
[SHOYO, internal]
A red uniform?
What school is that from?

140
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,011
[SHOYO]
Hey, whatcha up to?

141
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,180
[KENMA]
Huh? Oh...

142
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:15,350
Well, it's just..
uh... I'm lost.

143
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,186
[SHOYO]
You're lost? Are you
from out of town?

144
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:19,754
[KENMA]
Mm‐hm.

145
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:22,457
[SHOYO]
Is that a fun game?

146
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:24,493
[KENMA]
Uh... Not really...

147
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:26,395
I'm uh just trying
to pass the time.

148
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:27,929
[SHOYO]
Oh...

149
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,001
[SHOYO]
Hey! Do you play too?!

150
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:33,968
[KENMA]
Huh?

151
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,036
Those volleyball shoes!

152
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:35,970
In your bag!

153
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,472
[KENMA]
Oh. Yeah.

154
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:41,976
[SHOYO]
Shoyo Hinata! So...
What's your name?

155
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:44,346
[KENMA]
Kozume.

156
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:47,181
[SHOYO]
Kozume? Is that your first name?

157
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:51,520
[KENMA]
No, it's... it's Kenma.

158
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,723
[SHOYO] So are you...
in high school?
[KENMA] Yeah.

159
00:09:54,823 --> 00:09:57,559
[SHOYO] What's your year?
I'm a first‐year!
[KENMA] Second.

160
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:00,061
[SHOYO]
Oh crap, so you're my
upperclassman! I'm so sorry!

161
00:10:00,161 --> 00:10:06,568
[KENMA]
It's okay... After all... that
age‐based hierarchy stuff that
comes with sports... it's lame.

162
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:12,941
[SHOYO]
Oh... you think? Uh, so,
do you like volleyball?

163
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,245
[KENMA]
Eh... It's fine... I can't say I
really care.

164
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:21,683
[KENMA]
I don't mind it or anything...
but I'm not big on getting all
worn out.

165
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:24,519
But uh... my friend likes to
play...

166
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:27,088
and he needs me...
so I play too.

167
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:31,926
[SHOYO]
Oh. Well once you get used to
it... I'm sure you'll like
volleyball too.

168
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:35,530
[KENMA]
Whatever... I'm only playing
it while I'm in high school.

169
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,199
[SHOYO]
Yeah, what position?

170
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:39,133
[KENMA]
Uh... I'm a setter.

171
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:42,537
[SHOYO]
Really?! You're a lot different
than the setter we've got.

172
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:46,908
[SHOYO]
He's really growly and scary
like a saber‐tooth tiger! Grr...

173
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:48,310
[KENMA] Oh.

174
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,412
[SHOYO]
I'm a middle blocker by the way!

175
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:51,913
[KENMA]
Cool.

176
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:55,850
Oh... but you probably think
that's a little weird...

177
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,553
Shorter guys don't usually
play that position.

178
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:03,992
[KENMA] Nah, I don't think
that's weird... Not at all.
(SHOYO surprised)

179
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:06,728
[KENMA]
People say a lot of stuff about
me whenever I go to a game, too.

180
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:11,966
You know, things like, "I
thought the setter was supposed
to be the team member with the
strongest abilities...

181
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:15,069
so why did they ever pick
this guy of all people?"

182
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:18,873
[KENMA]
You see... I'm not all that much
of an athletic person.

183
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:22,744
[SHOYO]
Oh... So does your school have
a good volleyball team or what?

184
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:29,584
[KENMA]
Hmm... I don't know...
Apparently it used to be good
and then it went downhill.

185
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,820
[KENMA]
But as of recently...

186
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:35,023
I would say, it's pretty good.

187
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,365
[SHOYO]
Hang on... What school is‐

188
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:44,266
[KUROO]
Hey Kenma!

189
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:45,500
(surprised)

190
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,901
[KENMA]
Kuroo.

191
00:11:47,969 --> 00:11:49,871
[KENMA] Gotta go.
(SHOYO surprised)

192
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:53,442
[KENMA]
Later... okay?

193
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,043
[KUROO]
You shouldn't wander off.

194
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:57,979
[KENMA] Sorry.
[KUROO] You don't know
your way around here.

195
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,848
[SHOYO]
Later?

196
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:04,986
[KOSHI] Ah! Hey Hinata!
(SHOYO startled)

197
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:07,055
[KOSHI]
We were looking
all over for you.

198
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:10,459
[SHOYO]
Sorry Suga! I didn't realize
I went the wrong way.

199
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,929
[KOSHI]
You always give it your all,
no matter what kind of
practice we're doing.

200
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:18,933
[SHOYO]
Yeah. But I've still got
a really long way to go.

201
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,269
Huh?

202
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:23,572
[SHOYO]
There's a lot of things I need
to improve on.

203
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:25,407
[SHOYO]
I mean, yeah, it kinda
gets on my nerves

204
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:28,610
that no one sees me as anything
but half of a pair with
Kageyama...

205
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,845
but it's better than not
playing at all, right?

206
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:34,316
[SHOYO]
I want to stay on the court
the longest.

207
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,352
Huh?

208
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:42,357
[KOSHI]
So do I. All I want is to play
volleyball...

209
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:46,961
That's why... I do whatever
it takes to be my best.

210
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,998
[KOSHI]
C'mon... Don't want to be late
for lunch!

211
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:51,300
[SHOYO]
Yeah!

212
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:57,239
[MOON A] Wow... Nekoma's
setter's not very tall.
[GUYS] (warming up)

213
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,609
[MOON B]
Oh yeah... he sure does look
pretty scrawny, doesn't he?

214
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,877
[MOON C]
Maybe that's just
the backup setter?

215
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:05,880
[MOON A]
Beats me, I don't know
a thing about these guys.

216
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:10,319
[KUROO]
That short scrawny guy you seem
to be so concerned about...

217
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:14,723
[MOONS] (surprised)
[KUROO] He just happens to be
the spine... the brain... AND
heart...

218
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:17,058
[KUROO]
... of our team.

219
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:44,219
[KOSHI]
Uh, Coach?

220
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,389
[KEISHIN]
Hm? What's up?

221
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:49,858
[KOSHI]
Us third‐years... we don't
get a next season.

222
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,329
(KEISHIN surprised)
[KOSHI] That's why I want us to
win as many games as we can...

223
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:56,064
so we get more chances to play.

224
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:58,700
[KEISHIN] Uh?
[KOSHI] And if Kageyama has a
better likelihood

225
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,469
of making that happen for us...

226
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:04,138
...well then I think
you shouldn't hesitate
to put him in.

227
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,840
(KEISHIN gasp)

228
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,378
[KOSHI]
Daichi and Asahi have
been playing together since
their first year.

229
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:13,748
I want to stand on the court
with them. And the more plays
the better.

230
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:16,150
[KOSHI]
It's okay if I only
get to fill in,

231
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:21,155
like if Kageyama gets tired
or something happens to put
him out or whatever.

232
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:24,193
You might pity me for being set
aside for a first year...

233
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:28,463
but as long as I keep having
a chance to play... that's fine.

234
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:34,269
[KOSHI]
Even if I don't get to be the
official setter, I'll never give
up on volleyball...

235
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:37,306
I just want to be the best
part of the team I can.

236
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:39,908
[KEISHIN] Mm.
[KOSHI] Sorry...

237
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:42,477
if I'm overstepping
my bounds.

238
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:45,247
[KEISHIN] Sugawara.
[KOSHI] Huh?

239
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:47,716
[KEISHIN]
I think I might've
underestimated you.

240
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:50,519
Honestly, you're kinda
freaking me out right now.

241
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:52,053
[KOSHI]
What?

242
00:14:52,153 --> 00:14:54,456
[KEISHIN]
I don't have any coaching
experience...

243
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:59,461
but I swear I'll do whatever I
can... to keep you guys on the
winning track.

244
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:02,497
[KOSHI]
(happy) Thank you, sir!

245
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:03,832
[KEISHIN]
Sure.

246
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:07,536
Let's go for the win...
I think we can do this.

247
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:09,404
Yeah.

248
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:10,805
[ALL]
Time to eat!

249
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:12,541
[SHOYO TOBIO]
(extended eager eating)

250
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:15,944
[KEI] Jeez, slow it down...
You're gonna get sick.
[TADASHI] Ugh...

251
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:19,714
Don't stop eating!
Force it down if you have to!
How can you get through the
summer if you don't eat?!

252
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:22,851
[YU] You're gonna
shrivel up and die!
[ASAHI] You've got a big
appetite today. Suga.

253
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:27,021
[KOSHI] Yeah, maybe so...
Gotta stay strong!
[SHOYO] Are you gonna eat that?
I'll take it!

254
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:30,192
[YU]
No! Tadashi needs to
eat his own dinner!

255
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:33,762
(snoozing)

256
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:47,141
[KEISHIN]
Listen up. Here's our starting
order for Nekoma.

257
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:52,113
(serious)

258
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:55,817
[KEISHIN]
I know you haven't had
much time to get acquainted...

259
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:59,288
so I don't expect any
of you to be perfect.

260
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:01,189
[KEISHIN]
Just because we've got
a hotshot libero

261
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,893
and our ace just came
back doesn't mean victory
is a safe bet.

262
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:06,861
The winner keeps
the ball in play.

263
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:09,498
[KEISHIN]
So let's see how far this team
can take it,

264
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:12,667
those damn pussycats are not
gonna know what hit 'em!

265
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,403
[ALL]
Yeah!

266
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:21,943
[YU] Asahi!
[ASAHI] (startled) (awkward)

267
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:24,813
[YU]
Just forget about Suga...

268
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:27,882
Ennoshita's the guy you
should really be feeling
sorry for here.

269
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:30,619
[CHIKARA] What?‐ Me?!
[ASAHI] (stunned)

270
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,421
He's a wing spiker
just like you!

271
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:33,788
It must suck to be him!

272
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:37,192
[ASAHI] (scared) Uh?
[CHIKARA] Hey um... Asahi?

273
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:41,563
It's fine... I haven't always
been devoted to the sport.

274
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:44,499
[CHIKARA]
I ran away from the
game once... I get it.

275
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:47,469
[YU]
You just wait; he's gonna become
way stronger than you are.

276
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:51,973
He just needs time. Then he will
have the regular position! C'mon
tell him, Ennoshita!

277
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:54,008
[CHIKARA] (panic) Please don't
speak for me‐ uhh...

278
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:55,444
[YU] Oh wait, nevermind, he
would actually have

279
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:57,446
to take over Tanaka's position
first, wouldn't he?

280
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:59,614
[CHIKARA] (startled)
[RYUNOSUKE] So you're comin'
after my spot, are ya?

281
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:02,183
[RYUNOSUKE]
I'd like to see you try, you
little bastard!

282
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:05,354
[CHIKARA]
Whoa! I didn't say it,
Nishinoya did!

283
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:13,127
[SHOYO]
There we go... Hey uh...
Ennoshita?

284
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:15,430
[CHIKARA] Hm?
[SHOYO] About what you said...

285
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,967
[CHIKARA]
Oh... About how chose to leave
the game?

286
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:21,703
[CHIKARA]
You heard about the old Coach
Ukai

287
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:24,239
coming out of retirement
last year, right?
[SHOYO TOBIO] Yeah.

288
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,608
[HISASHI]
It's a little bit embarrassing
for us to admit,

289
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:30,812
but a bunch of us had some
trouble adjusting to his, let's
say "hardcore" training methods.

290
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:34,015
[CHIKARA]
We'd been doing volleyball club
just to have fun,

291
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:37,352
and then suddenly it was all
about winning and nothing else.

292
00:17:37,452 --> 00:17:40,789
We felt like our space had been
invaded, and it kinda scared us
away.

293
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,692
[KAZUHITO]
But then we really missed
playing volleyball...

294
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:48,397
And when we came back..
Well Coach Ukai had already
taken off.

295
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:51,566
[CHIKARA]
The thing is... we're not as
cool as you are.

296
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:57,171
But now that we're all here...
we promise to work just as hard
as the rest of the team...

297
00:17:57,272 --> 00:18:00,041
So let's do our best, okay?

298
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,577
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Right!

299
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:06,581
(practice efforts)

300
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:10,652
[KIYOKO] Sir?

301
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:12,487
[TAKEDA]
Hm? Oh, are they ready?

302
00:18:12,587 --> 00:18:14,856
[KIYOKO]
Yes... Alterations are
finished...

303
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:18,460
and they've been cleaned.
Here you go.

304
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,028
[SHOYO]
Whoaaa!

305
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:23,532
[SHOYO]
Just like I saw on TV! Oh?

306
00:18:23,632 --> 00:18:26,968
[SHOYO] Hey! Why's Noya the
only one with an orange one?
[TAKEDA] Here.
[KEI] Uh thanks a lot Takeda.

307
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:30,705
Because I'm the star!
Jeez, shouldn't that
be obvious by now?

308
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:33,107
The star? Cooooool!

309
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,210
[TOBIO]
The libero wears a different
color jersey

310
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,379
because he goes on and off of
the court during a game,

311
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,548
so it makes it easier to keep
track of him... dumbass.

312
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:44,319
[SHOYO]
(taken aback) I‐I knew that!
Everyone knows that! Uh?

313
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:50,759
[SHOYO]
(confused) Hey... His is one
number higher than mine!

314
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,060
[KEI RYUNOSUKE]
I knew you'd say that.

315
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,528
[TOBIO]
We're only first‐years;

316
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:55,797
you should be happy we
get uniforms at all.

317
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:57,131
[SHOYO]
Uh... I know that too!

318
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:58,967
[DAICHI]
Heh, that's funny...

319
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,569
I guess he doesn't
remember the number.

320
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:03,605
[KOSHI] He only saw him
on TV one time.
[SHOYO] Huh?

321
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:08,877
[DAICHI]
When the Tiny Giant
played in the nationals,
his number... was 10.

322
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,345
(SHOYO gasp)

323
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,221
[SHOYO]
Wow, Coach, did you plan this
just for me?!

324
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:20,722
[KEISHIN]
No, settle down, Ginger.

325
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:22,056
[SHOYO]
It must be destiny!

326
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:23,258
[TOBIO]
Or a coincidence.

327
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:25,159
[SHOYO]
Aw, don't be jealous, okay?

328
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,028
[TOBIO]
Why would I be jealous of you?!

329
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:30,399
Here's the thing. When Hinata's
hero, the Tiny Giant,

330
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:34,469
was on the team, Karasuno
was the best it's ever been.

331
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:38,240
[KEISHIN]
But in spite of that, we didn't
win against Nekoma even once.

332
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,976
It ended in a losing streak.
So let's turn that around.

333
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:46,648
[ALL] Yeah!
[KEISHIN] Alright! You better
get your asses back to practice!

334
00:19:46,748 --> 00:19:48,783
[ALL]
Yessir!

335
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,619
[TAKEDA] I guess Nekoma must
have a really good team.
[DAICHI] Let's do some
more drills!

336
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,621
[TAKEDA] So what all do
you know about them?
[ALL] Right!

337
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:55,257
[KEISHIN]
I don't really have a clue what
they're like these days...

338
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:57,759
but that team has always
had some talented receivers.

339
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:02,030
[KEISHIN]
They didn't have stand‐out
players, but their defense
was tight.

340
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,932
The opposite of us, I guess.

341
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:07,135
And that whole "cat" thing...
it makes sense.

342
00:20:07,236 --> 00:20:09,571
[KEISHIN]
They're extremely agile.

343
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,241
[SHIRATO 4]
What the heck?

344
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:13,508
No matter how many
times I hit it,

345
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:15,510
I can't get it to fall
into their court!

346
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:21,550
(whistle)(long whistle)

347
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,353
(NEKOMA celebrating)

348
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:25,820
[SHIRATO 11]
I don't understand...

349
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,056
They don't have any superstar
guys on their team...

350
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:30,659
[SHIRATO 11]
... so what's their secret?

351
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:41,270
[YAMAMOTO]
Here's the most important
issue... Do they or do they
not have a female manager?

352
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,738
[YAMAMOTO]
My yakisoba bun is saying no!

353
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:48,443
[INUOKA] Huh? But don't you WANT
them to have one? I say yes.
[SHIBAYAMA] Yeah, I agree.

354
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:53,615
[YAMAMOTO]
You crazy?! We don't have a girl
manager, so I'm just gonna be
pissed off if they do!

355
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,918
[INUOKA SHIBAYAMA] Huh?
[YAMAMOTO] Or what if
it's worse?

356
00:20:57,018 --> 00:20:59,454
She could be a girl AND
extremely hot!

357
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:03,192
I would never forgive those
stupid jerks for that! Never!

358
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:08,230
[YAMAMOTO] You'll pay for having
a babe for a manager, Karasuno!
[KUROO] (annoyed)
Give it a rest, Yamamoto!

359
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,165
[YAMAMOTO]
Hey! What's Kenma think?

360
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,336
[KENMA]
Does it uh...
really even matter?

361
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:16,238
[YAMAMOTO]
Humph... I knew
you would say that.

362
00:21:16,338 --> 00:21:18,006
[KENMA]
But...

363
00:21:18,106 --> 00:21:20,342
I do kinda look forward
to playing them...

364
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:21,676
you know, a little bit.

365
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:22,911
[YAMAMOTO] Huh?
[INUOKA SHIBAYAMA] (surprise)

366
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:24,946
[YAMAMOTO]
Huh? Whoa!

367
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:28,116
Since when are YOU looking
forward to ANYTHING, Mr.
Couldn't‐Care‐Less Kenma
Kozume?!

368
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:31,620
[KUROO]
If you're that fired up, maybe I
should make you do some extra
reps.

369
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,857
[YAMAMOTO]
(extended strain)
N‐no, that's okay...

370
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:41,196
(CROWD cheers)

371
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:50,839
[TOBIO]
Hey, Hinata... They said
the first‐years can hit
the bath now.

372
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:55,076
[TOBIO]
Seriously? are you
about to throw up again?

373
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:57,779
[SHOYO]
(startled) What?!
Of course I'm not!

374
00:21:58,713 --> 00:22:00,315
I was just thinking...

375
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:02,016
they're all preparing
for the match...

376
00:22:02,116 --> 00:22:04,185
even if they're not playing.

377
00:22:05,354 --> 00:22:07,188
[SHOYO]
The only reason the Coach
put me in the game

378
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:09,157
is because of your sets.

379
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:14,596
I hate to say this, but if not
for you, I probably wouldn't be
in the lineup.

380
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:18,166
[SHOYO]
I'm going in first!

381
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:19,434
(surprised) Hey!

382
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:21,503
You got a head start,
you little cheater!

383
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:23,772
[SHOYO TOBIO] (extended powerup
yell and arguing)

384
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:27,476
[KEI]
Even going to the bathroom's
a competition... Those
guys're morons.

385
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:30,645
[TADASHI]
(yawn) I'm getting tired
just watching them.

386
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:33,715
[DAICHI]
Hey! Quit screwing around!

387
00:24:22,324 --> 00:24:24,459
[DAICHI]
It's time for our
game against Nekoma.

388
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,330
[RYUNOSUKE]
Great, I can't wait to play
against The School for Guys
with Weird‐Shaped Heads.

389
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,931
Haha! Did you see those clowns?

390
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:32,133
[YU]
Yeah, well at least
they're not very tall.

391
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:33,502
[RYUNOSUKE]
Neither are you, short stuff.

392
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:36,805
Next Haikyu!!
"The Cat And Crow Reunion."

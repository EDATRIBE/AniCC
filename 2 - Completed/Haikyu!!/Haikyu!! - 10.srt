1
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:05,431
[TOBIO] Damn!

2
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:06,966
(focus)

3
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:13,740
[SHIMADA] Whoa! It's up!
[UCHIZAWA] Nice follow‐thru!

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,611
You have to ask the setter
for another chance, Asahi!
You're the ace!

5
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:20,046
(nervous)

6
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:25,451
[KOSHI] Shimada!
[ASAHI] SUGAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

7
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:26,318
[KOSHI] (gasp)

8
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:27,554
Over here!

9
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:29,221
[KOSHI]
Asahi!

10
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:40,900
(happy)

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,301
(happy)

12
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:43,402
(focused)

13
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,838
(breathless)

14
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:47,974
(ALL amazed)

15
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:51,443
[TAKEDA] Did you just hear that
noise?! It was like BLAHW!
(KEISHIN surprised)

16
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:54,614
Nice one! You should
be proud! Both of you!

17
00:00:54,714 --> 00:01:01,453
Thanks a lot... Uh great ball...
Suga... And Nishinoya's
receive was perfect.

18
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:04,190
(BOTH chuckle)

19
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:09,762
[SHOYO]
So... That's the Ace.

20
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,230
[TOBIO] Hey.
[SHOYO] Hm?

21
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,833
I know you wanted to see
the ace and everything...

22
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,635
but don't freak out!

23
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:17,504
What?! I‐I'm not freaking out!

24
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:21,641
[SHOYO]
I may not be as tall or strong
as him, but I've got spirit!

25
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:25,311
Next ace... is me!

26
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:03,843
[YU]
The average hand is
approximately 3 quarters
of an inch thick...

27
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:08,080
I have slightly smaller
hands than most people
in my age group...

28
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,351
But that three‐fourths of
an inch between the ball
and the floor...

29
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:19,358
makes all the difference in the
world... to keep the ace alive.

30
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:27,266
This is what happens when
you skip club for a month!
You can't jump worth a crap!

31
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:29,335
Oh... I'm sorry.

32
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:31,604
Haha, don't you think
that's a bit harsh?

33
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:35,374
(happy) Reunited!

34
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:38,845
So not only are we up
against a veteran team
from the Association

35
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:42,749
but Asahi's with them?
We've sure got our work
cut out for us now.

36
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:46,352
(laughter) What are you
going on about, Daichi?

37
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:48,855
[RYUNOSUKE] You know you've
got me on your side‐
[SHOYO] You've got me
on your side!

38
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,222
Uh.. What?

39
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:52,358
Hinata! Mind your
own business!

40
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,962
I was just about to be a
badass and then you popped
up and ruined everything!

41
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:59,131
That was freakin' incredible!
Nishinoya's like a pro!

42
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:03,069
If we can retrieve
blocked balls, then we'll
be unstoppable for sure!

43
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:08,040
[KEISHIN] Don't bank on that...
He's not gonna be able to do it
every time.
[TAKEDA] Huh?

44
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,611
[KEISHIN]
The ball falls downward at a
speed of 60 miles an hour.

45
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:18,217
And that's from just 6 to 8 feet
away. Nobody could save all
of them; it's impossible.
[TAKEDA] Oh.

46
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:22,388
[KEISHIN]
Listen... The best thing we
can do is get it into these
boys' heads

47
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,591
that a blocked ball isn't
the end of the world.

48
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:27,159
Just keep getting blocked
and I'll get every single
one of 'em!
Huh?

49
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:29,461
[KEISHIN] Once you figure
out that your teammates
have your back,
[KOSHI] No way, Asahi's the ace.

50
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,363
[KEISHIN] your frame
of mind totally changes.
[KOSHI] He'll never
get blocked again!

51
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:32,431
[TAKEDA] That makes sense.
[ASAHI] Don't say that!

52
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,333
[MORI] Go for it!
(whistle)

53
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:37,303
[DAICHI]
Ennoshita! Cover it!

54
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:40,472
[KEISHIN] They could stand to
work on their receives as a
team. [CHIKARA] Hey Kageyama,
cover me!

55
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:45,712
[TOBIO] Got it!
[KEISHIN] That setter's got a
knack for gauging distance from
the point of impact.

56
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:48,314
[KEISHIN, internal]
If I remember right,
he's a first‐year.

57
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,083
(internal) Wonder
which setter I'll use‐

58
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:52,484
(KEISHIN surprised)

59
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,987
(SHIMADA & ASAHI shocked)
(whistle)

60
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,122
(KEISHIN stunned)

61
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:57,489
That's what I'm
talkin' about!

62
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,559
[SHOYO] Thanks!
(YU & ASAHI stunned)

63
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:04,163
It's all thanks to
Kageyama's sets... I can
get past anybody now!

64
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,934
Oh wow, I guess he wasn't
kidding around when he
told me that.

65
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:12,705
Dude, that was unbelievable!
How'd you do that?!
I couldn't look away!

66
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,340
(shy laugh)

67
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,777
[KEISHIN, internal]
They didn't give each
other any kind of signal...

68
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:22,048
How did they time it so well?
(serious) You!

69
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:26,052
(SHOYO startled)
[KEISHIN] What made you jump
over there... huh, Ginger?!

70
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:31,357
Huh?! Uh... 'Cause it'll come
to me wherever I am... uh, sir!

71
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:37,730
[KEISHIN, internal]
(surprised) The shorty obviously
jumped without even LOOKING for
the ball.

72
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,635
[KEISHIN, internal]
Does that first‐year setter
automatically adapt to
everything the little guy does?

73
00:05:42,735 --> 00:05:51,410
[KEISHIN
KEISHIN] How's that kid so sure
that the set is coming? Who in
their right mind goes full‐swing

74
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:53,345
What are you guys,
a couple of weirdos?!

75
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:56,348
(SHOYO & TOBIO taken aback)
Weirdos?

76
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:57,850
Are we?

77
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,351
I dunno.
(KEI snickers)

78
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,753
[TOBIO] Wipe that smirk
off your face, Tsukishima!

79
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:02,555
[KEISHIN] I have no what those
two have going on,

80
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,490
but I'm not going
to discourage it.

81
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:11,430
[KOSHI]
So... I content to just hid in
Kageyama's shadow... It was...
easier.

82
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:14,967
[TOBIO] Let's try for another
one like that, Hinata.
[KEISHIN] Man, that first‐year
setter's gotta be some kinda

83
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:19,171
[SHOYO] Okay! (whistle)
[TOBIO] Go for it!
[KEISHIN] In fact, he seems like
he's got superhuman abilities.

84
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:20,940
[KEISHIN]
Still...

85
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:24,343
[SHIMADA]
Ooh! Straight spike!

86
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:26,478
And this is after he's
been out for a month,

87
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:27,914
marvelous bastard!

88
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,616
You are way
too excited.

89
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:32,418
That split‐second timing between
the toss and the spike...

90
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,690
It's the kind of thing that
can only be accomplished after
you've been through a hell of a
lot of training.

91
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,592
[KOSHI & ASAHI]
Yes! (laugh)

92
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,795
[KEISHIN]
A bond of trust like they have
can't be built in a day.

93
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:45,497
[KEISHIN]
We have a first‐year setter
with amazing talent...

94
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:50,236
And another pair with an
incredible connection with
each other. We have weapons.

95
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:51,170
(grin)

96
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,371
(nervous)

97
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:57,476
[DAICHI]
I'm free!

98
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,946
This ain't a bad team
you've got here!

99
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:02,749
(TAKEDA slapped)
[KEISHIN] Why didn't
you tell me, Specs?

100
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:06,719
(straighten up)
Yeah I've told you
several times, actually.

101
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:11,490
(ALL celebrate)

102
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:12,859
[KEISHIN]
But the Ginger...

103
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,327
I don't understand why
he's a middle blocker...

104
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:19,766
He's got pretty good quick
attacks, but can that peewee
actually block?

105
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:25,071
[ASAHI, internal]
(question) He's staring at me...

106
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,906
Oh... that's
right, I forgot!

107
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:30,042
This is Hinata's chance
to go head‐to‐head with
the current ace.

108
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:34,313
[KEISHIN] Huh?
[TAKEDA] The thing is... Hinata
enrolled at Karasuno

109
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,783
because he wants to be
just like the Tiny Giant.

110
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:40,286
[KEISHIN]
Yeah. That's right. That
little guy was an ace too.

111
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:44,356
That's why he's always so
fired up... He's trying to
be the same thing.

112
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:49,428
This'll be huge for him...
a chance for him to test his
abilities against Asahi.

113
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:54,767
Heh, well isn't that special?
Although it's kinda like a kid
against a grown man.

114
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,035
(TAKEDA awkward)

115
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:59,839
[ASAHI, internal]
Parallel ball.

116
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:03,375
[SHOYO, internal]
I can't believe I'm marking
the ace right now.

117
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:06,345
(internal) The ace of
Karasuno High School!

118
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,880
[CHIKARA]
Get ready!

119
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:10,449
[TAKINOUE]
Nice receive!

120
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:15,588
[ASAHI]
It only took him a
split‐second to catch me!

121
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:18,124
(SHOYO gasp)

122
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:23,930
(long whistle)
[ASAHI, internal] I knew how
high that kid could jump...

123
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,833
[SHOYO] I'm sorry!
[DAICHI] It's fine!
You were pretty close...
[ASAHI] ...but it's amazing to

124
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:31,871
[DAICHI] Maybe next time.
[SHOYO] Right! I'll try!
[ASAHI] I mean, how is something
like that even possible?

125
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:35,441
[SHOYO] He's great... And he's
been out for a whole month!
[KOSHI] Nice one, Asahi.
(ASAHI laughs)

126
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,678
You've been holding your
hands in the wrong position
when you block...

127
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:42,281
This how you do it
here! Like this!

128
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:44,751
Are you listening?
Look at me!

129
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:46,819
[KOSHI] Let's keep it up, you
guys.
[TOBIO] Hey!

130
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:54,694
[SHOYO, internal]
He was always covered in
sweat and looked like he was
hurting...

131
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:57,463
but the Tiny Giant never
stopped jumping.

132
00:08:57,564 --> 00:09:00,199
I didn't really understand it at
the time...

133
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,535
but I think that's what it
means to be in a position

134
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:05,237
[YU] I'm gonna be
counting on you, Asahi.
[SHOYO, internal]
where your teammates

135
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:10,076
[SHOYO, internal]
Everybody on the team had faith
that he could score the point...

136
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:13,245
so they did everything
they could to get the
ball over to him.

137
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:17,684
(internal) That must be what
it's like to be Asahi too.

138
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:20,620
[TOBIO] Hey.
[SHOYO] The ace is awesome!

139
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,722
Even if they're blocking him,
it doesn't matter

140
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:25,725
'cause he's got enough power
to break right through 'em!

141
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:28,260
[SHOYO]
What?

142
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:30,663
Nothing.

143
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,899
Hm?

144
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,400
[KOSHI] Forward!
[RYUNOSUKE] Cover it!

145
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,102
[ASAHI]
Hey, left side!

146
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:37,870
(internal) If I was tall
and powerful, I could be
just like him...

147
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,072
[DAICHI] We need to boost our
defense on the left side!

148
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:42,208
[SHOYO, internal] No,
[DAICHI] Hinata, move closer to
the back! Move to the back.

149
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:45,077
[SHOYO, internal]
the Tiny Giant was amazing
without being tall! But still...

150
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:49,749
(internal)
I wish...

151
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:51,784
[DAICHI] Hinata!
(SHOYO startled)

152
00:09:53,686 --> 00:09:55,955
(SHOYO smacked)

153
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:56,923
(shock)

154
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:57,790
GAHH!

155
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:04,430
[ASAHI]
(panicked running) Hinata!

156
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:06,165
[SHOYO] (groan)

157
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:07,499
[RYUNOSUKE] Well, he's alive.
(ASAHI panicking)

158
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,768
[YU]
Are you okay?

159
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:10,169
[ASAHI] I am SO sorry, Hinata!

160
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:11,470
[KEI] You shouldn't feel bad,

161
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:12,705
it's his fault for spacing out
like an idiot.

162
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:15,875
[KEISHIN]
It's gonna be okay, Specs.

163
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,678
[SHOYO]
Uh... Sorry, guys... I'm okay.

164
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:20,847
[DAICHI]
Are you sure? Maybe you'd
better sit out a bit‐

165
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:23,049
I swear I'm okay!
Don't worry about me;

166
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,451
I just didn't move out
of the way fast enough,
that's all.

167
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:27,386
[SHOYO]
I get hit in the face a lot.

168
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:28,555
Uh, that's not good...

169
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:31,257
(awkward laughter)

170
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:32,058
(shock)

171
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:33,760
Huh?

172
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:40,466
(ALL shocked)
(ASAHI scared)

173
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,034
[TOBIO]
It's the middle of a game.

174
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:44,403
What could you possibly
be spacing out about.

175
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:48,541
(SHOYO scared)
(backing up)

176
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:53,580
[SHOYO, internal]
Oh crap. Kageyama's not
yelling... which means he's
REALLY mad.

177
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,482
This is just like that
time I hit him in the
head with the ball.

178
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,551
[TOBIO] I know what it is.
(SHOYO gasp)

179
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:01,420
[TOBIO]
You wish you were the ace don't
you...

180
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:04,891
You don't want to just be
the team decoy... You think
it's lame.

181
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:10,697
[TOBIO]
You want to be as big and
important as Asahi so you can
be the ace instead, amiright?

182
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:13,165
[SHOYO, taken aback]
That's not how I feel!

183
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:17,169
Well... uh... maybe...

184
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,072
[TOBIO]
Now that you know we
have an ace...

185
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:23,576
it's not just something you
dream about... You're jealous!

186
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:24,977
(SHOYO surprised)

187
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,215
Think about that garbage on
your own time from now on!

188
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:35,321
[SHOYO]
(upset) Okay, so I'm jealous...
Is that so awful?

189
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:39,358
How could you understand
how I feel? You've always
been really tall!

190
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,694
(pissed)

191
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:43,896
[DAICHI] Look‐
[JANITOR] Hey, uh fellas!

192
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:48,034
[DAICHI] Huh?
[JANITOR] It's time to
close down the gym for the
night... Put your stuff away.

193
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,837
I'm sorry, sir!
Our game's not over yet.

194
00:11:50,937 --> 00:11:52,539
Do you know what
time it is?

195
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,776
[TAKEDA]
Yes, I'll be sure to lock up.

196
00:11:56,876 --> 00:12:02,281
[SHOYO, internal]
It's my fault for holding up the
game. And now Kageyama's mad.

197
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:04,250
Don't doddle.

198
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,519
Thanks, sorry to bother you.

199
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:09,321
[DAICHI]
Sorry, Takeda!
We'll hurry it up.

200
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:10,356
[TAKEDA]
(affirmative)

201
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:11,924
You tell 'em, Take!

202
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:14,393
[DAICHI]
Right... Let's pick up
where we left off!

203
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:15,762
[ALL]
Yessir!

204
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:17,363
(whistle)
[KOSHI] One more!

205
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:18,598
[UCHIZAWA]
Let's go!

206
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:20,800
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hope you punks are ready!

207
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,069
[TAKINOUE]
Hey... Based on what we've seen
so far,

208
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:25,471
it looks like the high schoolers
are in their best rotation now.

209
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:28,875
We better keep our eyes peeled
for the shorty's quick attack.

210
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:30,409
[ASAHI] Yeah.
[TOBIO] Listen.

211
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,844
[TAKINOUE] Huh?
[ASAHI] Hm?

212
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,615
My next set... goes
straight to this guy.

213
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:38,685
[TOBIO]
Block him with
all you've got.

214
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:01,508
Yeah... I'm gonna send it
to him... Just thought you
should know that.

215
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:02,709
[TAKINOUE ASAHI]
(confused)

216
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,544
[TAKINOUE]
Oh yeah? You daring us?

217
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:07,880
[TOBIO]
Sure. Call it what you want...
But it's going to Hinata.

218
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,585
[TAKINOUE ASAHI] Huh?
[TAKINOUE] (laugh) You're funny,
kid! That's really good!

219
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:15,588
Alright... Thanks
for the heads up.

220
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:17,423
You're welcome.

221
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,459
(ASAHI surprised)

222
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:28,334
[KEISHIN] Is he crazy? The whole
point of a quick attack is the
fact that your opponent's not
expecting it...

223
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:31,437
So There's no way Ginger can
get through a head‐on block
now...

224
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:34,774
[KEISHIN] not with all
the cards on the table!
[TAKEDA] I agree.

225
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:37,143
[TAKINOUE] Better shut 'em down.
[TAKEDA] His height already
gives him a disadvantage with
blockers as it is.

226
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,612
[UCHIZAWA]
No doubt. Can't lose
to a buncha kids.

227
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:45,952
[SHOYO, internal]
What the heck is Kageyama's
problem? Why'd he have to give
our plan away?

228
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:49,055
Those blockers are way too
big for me to spike through!

229
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:56,028
[TOBIO]
All you are now... is a clumsy
little turd who just happens to
be fast and good at jumping.

230
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,898
Someone like you could never
be the ace of this team.

231
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:00,199
(SHOYO taken aback)

232
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,134
[RYUNOSUKE] Hey now.
[ASAHI] That's not cool.

233
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:06,338
[TOBIO]
But... With me around,
you are the greatest!

234
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:07,907
[SHOYO]
What?

235
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:10,843
[TOBIO]
Look at Asahi. His spikes
are forceful enough

236
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,444
to cut straight through
a triple block.

237
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:15,181
[ASAHI]
Huh?! W‐well not
every time, but uh...

238
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:16,883
[YU]
Whoa, calm it down, buddy!

239
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,685
You might not have what he
does...

240
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:22,288
but how often do you really
get blocked? when you hit
one of MY sets?

241
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:23,556
Hm?

242
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,958
(whistle)

243
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:27,727
[TAKINOUE] Go for it!

244
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:28,828
[CHIKARA] I got it!

245
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:30,029
[DAICHI] Nice receive!

246
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:32,164
[SHOYO, interal]
They're too tall...

247
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:33,866
[TOBIO] Go around!
(SHOYO gasp)

248
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:36,936
[TOBIO]
What other option do
you have, you idiot?!

249
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,473
[SHOYO, internal]
If you can't get through...

250
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:43,743
[SHOYO, internal] ...go around!

251
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:44,944
[ASAHI TAKINOUE]
(shocked)

252
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:46,312
(KEISHIN shocked)

253
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:48,715
[SHOYO, internal]
I hate being blocked.

254
00:14:48,815 --> 00:14:50,517
I hate being pushed back!

255
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,922
[SHOYO]
I don't have a chance of winning
with these blockers in my way.

256
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:59,559
[SHOYO]
I can't break through them
like the ace does.

257
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:02,962
[SHOYO, internal]
But...

258
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:06,165
[TOBIO, internal]
With me around...

259
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:12,138
[TOBIO]
...you... are the greatest!

260
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:19,011
(ALL astonished)

261
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:22,181
[TOBIO]
You might not be the
ace of this team...

262
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:25,017
[TOBIO]
But with your speed and
jumps... and my sets...

263
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:28,187
you can take on anybody!

264
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,389
[TOBIO]
The ace powers
through for a point,

265
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:32,759
and you dodge for yours.

266
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:34,293
But a point is a point!

267
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,129
[TOBIO]
You don't need a crown
with "ace" written on it!

268
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,966
You just need you to
score all you can!

269
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,234
[TOBIO]
That's why our opponents
will be marking you!

270
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:46,405
Your decoy skills will free up
our other spikers to score
points too...

271
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:50,677
[TOBIO] including
the ace! Right?!
[RYUNOSUKE] (startled) Uh‐huh!

272
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,478
Look this guy is
right, you know!

273
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:54,547
Having you as a decoy could
make a major difference

274
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:56,348
in our success rate every game!

275
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:57,850
It's an advantage.

276
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,586
So tell me, Hinata...

277
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:02,622
Do you still feel like the
job of a decoy is useless?!

278
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,426
(panting)

279
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:15,902
[SHOYO]
No.

280
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:17,136
Huh?!

281
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:20,072
Of course it isn't!

282
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,608
Good!

283
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,010
(SHIMADA YU stunned)
(KOSHI laugh)

284
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:29,716
That last hit you did...
it was great.

285
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:31,417
(happy)

286
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:34,220
[TOBIO]
I'm sorry for interrupting
the practice game, sir!

287
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,688
[DAICHI]
Oh.. that's... uhh...

288
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:36,923
[SHOYO]
Yeah, sorry!

289
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:38,057
If it's okay with you...

290
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,626
[BOTH]
Let's keep playing!

291
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:42,094
[RYUNOSUKE]
Alright! We're gonna
catch right up!

292
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:43,262
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Yeah.

293
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:46,566
[KEISHIN] Hey, specs. Those two
there.
[TAKEDA] Huh?

294
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,135
[TOBIO]
Anyway, just because you
happened to nail it that time

295
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:51,237
doesn't mean you should keep on
jumping in the same direction.
[TAKEDA] You mean Hinata and
Kageyama?

296
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:53,172
Did they meet during
middle school?

297
00:16:53,272 --> 00:16:56,208
Or were the two of 'em close in
elementary school or something?

298
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:59,879
Huh? Oh not at all, actually the
two of them just met recently...

299
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:03,049
We had a lot of trouble with
them at first because they
didn't get along.

300
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,150
[KEISHIN]
Hm.

301
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,953
Um, why do you ask?

302
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:09,055
[KEISHIN]
Whaddya know.

303
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:11,758
(whistle)
(ALL celebrate)

304
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:14,226
These high schoolers
really know their stuff...

305
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,530
I think we're gonna have
to kick it up a notch.

306
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:22,034
[DAICHI, internal]
A jump float!

307
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:23,570
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hinata!

308
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,138
[SHOYO]
Alright, I'm open!

309
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:27,974
(SHOYO gasp) (slide)
[RYUNOSUKE] Uh?!

310
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:30,176
[SHIMADA]
(laugh) Face plant!

311
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:31,778
You are kind of a jerk.

312
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:33,880
[TAKEDA]
Hmmm? Hey...

313
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,684
I've never seen a serve
like that; didn't seem to
have much momentum on it.

314
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:39,285
That's called a
jump float serve.

315
00:17:39,385 --> 00:17:42,421
[KEISHIN]
Without any spin, it's
got a shaky trajectory.

316
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:45,057
It could swerve or
drop at any second.

317
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:48,695
[TAKEDA]
Ah.. it's like a knuckle
ball... Interesting!

318
00:17:48,795 --> 00:17:50,096
(TADASHI astonished)

319
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:52,431
[KIYOKO]
Uh Tadashi... they
just got a point.

320
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:55,802
[TADASHI]
(surprised) Oh, I'm so sorry.

321
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:57,537
[MORI]
One more!

322
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,607
[RYUNOSUKE]
Whoa! (whistle)

323
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,611
(whistle)

324
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:07,479
(whistle) [UCHIZAWA] Excellent!
(TADASHI stunned)
[SHIMADA] Sweet!
[KEISHIN] That's four in a row.

325
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,416
[KEISHIN] Those two first years
have a good combo worked out...
[TAKINOUE] What's wrong, high
schoolers?

326
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:12,719
[KEISHIN] but the receivers
do need some work...
[TAKINOUE] What happened to all
that enthusiasm from before?

327
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:14,353
[KEISHIN] Make sure you write
that down.
[SHIMADA] That's match point!

328
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:17,456
[SHIMADA]
Heh. You kids are all mine now!

329
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:24,096
[TOBIO] Nice receive!
[TAKINOUE] You're not gonna get
away with it again, short pants!

330
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,432
[TAKINOUE] Ha! Gotcha!

331
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,001
[ASAHI] Uh‐oh!
[TAKINOUE] Ack!

332
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,571
[RYUNOSUKE]
'Sup, scrubs?! Remember me?!

333
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:33,105
[RYUNOSUKE]
What?!

334
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,274
[KOSHI]
Nice save!

335
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:37,577
[ASAHI]
Suga!

336
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:38,811
[KOSHI]
Asahi!

337
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:51,257
(whistle) (long whistle)

338
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:56,162
(ALL cheers)
[RYUNOSUKE] Aw man! My bad,
dude! They weren't even trying
to mark me either were they?!

339
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,497
[SHOYO] Oh! No!
[RYUNOSUKE] That
was awesome though..

340
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:01,300
You must've had every set of
eyes on you by the end of it...

341
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,903
Must say I'm a little
jealous of you.

342
00:19:04,003 --> 00:19:09,609
[RYUNOSUKE] Keep it up next
game! (laughs)
[SHOYO] Ah... um.. okay!

343
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:12,612
[SHIMADA]
Man, that game made me feel like
I was in school again!

344
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:17,449
Those were some good times
right? All the girls! All the
drama...

345
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,921
"With me around, you're the
greatest!"? You kiddin?, I wish
I could say crap like that...

346
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:23,723
Man, high school was fun.

347
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:25,858
[YU TOBIO]
(groan)

348
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,128
[TAKINOUE]
You kids really made us feel
like some dinosaurs in there.

349
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:31,163
[KOSHI]
Uh.. sorry, sir.

350
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:34,166
Well Anyway... you might
not have everything
figured out just yet...

351
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:38,971
but once you do, I think
you guys are really going
places. I mean it.

352
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:40,873
(ALL excited)

353
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:46,145
[DAICHI]
Thank you for coming!

354
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:47,780
[EVERYONE]
Thank you!

355
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:53,219
[KEISHIN]
Okay. Receiving... That's the
biggest issue right now.

356
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:56,188
[KEISHIN]
So we'll be working
on that tomorrow!

357
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:57,757
[ALL]
Yessir!

358
00:19:57,857 --> 00:19:59,225
[DAICHI]
Thank you!

359
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:00,527
[ALL]
Thank you!

360
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,328
[KEISHIN]
Now... don't forget to stretch.

361
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:03,696
[DAICHI]
Let's stretch out guys!

362
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:05,565
[ALL]
Yessir!

363
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,901
[DAICHI]
Rotations! 1, 2, 3, 4...

364
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,471
[ALL] 5, 6, 7, 8!
[TAKEDA] Is their receiving
really that awful? You seem
stressed out.

365
00:20:12,572 --> 00:20:15,041
[KEISHIN]
No... that's not what I'm
worried about most.

366
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:21,180
I never really thought about
it that hard when I was up for
selection during my time in high
school...

367
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,451
[KEISHIN]
...but the guy doing the
selecting has his work cut out
for him.

368
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:29,822
[DAICHI] Let's
put all this away!
[TADASHI] Yessir!

369
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:33,259
[KOSHI] Yamaguchi, bring the
balls over there... Okay, you
ready?
[TADASHI] Coming!

370
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,128
[ASAHI] (exhale) (huh?)
[SHOYO] Asahi?

371
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:38,164
[DAICHI]
Let's pick up the pace,
everybody!

372
00:20:38,264 --> 00:20:40,332
[SHOYO]
I may not be the ace...

373
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:44,036
...but I AM one of the guys who
clears the way for the ace...

374
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:46,739
I'm a great decoy.. the best!

375
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,508
[ASAHI] (surprised)

376
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:53,546
[SHOYO]
Ah! But I can't really do that
without Kageyama's sets...

377
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:56,983
[SHOYO]
So... What I'm saying is...

378
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:02,855
[SHOYO]
"I'll do my best" sounds kinda
cheesy... but "Let's do our
best" sounds even worse, so...

379
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:08,227
[ASAHI]
Hinata? That IS... your name,
right?

380
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:14,033
Listen, "ace" is just another
name for a wing spiker in left
position... You do understand
that, right?

381
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:17,436
[SHOYO] Uh‐huh.
[ASAHI] When it comes to
breaking through a triple
block...

382
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:22,742
or hitting the ball when the
timing's tight... those things
are definitely the ace's job...

383
00:21:22,842 --> 00:21:28,515
With your speed and jumps...
and my sets... you can take
on anybody!

384
00:21:28,615 --> 00:21:35,121
But still, to have a setter say
something like that about you...
well, that's pretty impressive
in and of itself.

385
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:36,523
Huh?

386
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:38,558
[ASAHI]
A‐anyway... I guess...

387
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:40,159
what I'm trying to say is...

388
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,895
whether you're a decoy..
or you're the ace...

389
00:21:42,995 --> 00:21:47,700
I'd say the coolest player is
the one causes the most panic
for the opposing team.

390
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,303
Like, "Watch that
mid‐blocker; he's crazy!"
That kinda thing.

391
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:52,905
Uh‐huh,
uh‐huh!

392
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:56,375
(smile) Let's do our best.

393
00:21:56,475 --> 00:22:02,715
(surprised) Will do!

394
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:07,286
Oh! I guess that all depends on
whether or not they let me back
into the starting lineup, huh?
(surprised)

395
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:12,124
[KOSHI] (laughter)
Man, for such a big guy..
you really are a softy.

396
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,061
[DAICHI]
It's real good to see you back
in action again, Suga.

397
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:18,665
[KOSHI]
Yeah, sorry I got all obsessive
and weird about everything.

398
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:20,499
[DAICHI]
(surprised) I didn't
say you did...

399
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,036
[DAICHI] It's good
to have you back too.
[YU] Aw yeah!

400
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:28,240
[DAICHI] But try not to
assault the Vice Principal
anymore... got that?
(YU stunned)

401
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:34,681
And finally ... I'm glad our
soft‐spoken wing blocker is back
from his little vacation...
right, Asahi?

402
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:36,348
(deflated)

403
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,384
Let's get everything
squared away

404
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:39,886
and call it a night!

405
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:48,394
[DAICHI]
Keep it up, guys! Alright?

406
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:51,063
[ALL]
Yeah!

407
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:24,256
[RYUNOSUKE]
Almost time for training camp.

408
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:28,528
[YU]
Ch‐Yeah, I can't wait to
be under the same roof with
Kiyoko‐ Tanaka!

409
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:29,328
[RYUNOSUKE]
Noya!

410
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:30,329
[YU]
Tanaka!

411
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:31,263
[RYUNOSUKE]
Noya! Noya!

412
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:32,364
[YU]
Tanaka!

413
00:24:32,464 --> 00:24:33,666
[SHOYO]
Uh, what's happening?

414
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:34,901
[KIYOKO]
Just ignore them...

415
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:37,870
[KIYOKO]
Next Haikyu!! "The Decision."

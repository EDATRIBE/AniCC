1
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,895
[Toru]:
A one‐handed set?!

2
00:00:25,307 --> 00:00:29,111
[Crowd/Team Karasuno]:
(loud cheering)

3
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:32,014
[Takinoue]:
They got got it!
They tied it back up!

4
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,849
So what is
this called again?

5
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:35,217
It's a deuce!

6
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,889
[Shoyo/Tobio]:
The first team to score
two points... wins!

7
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:19,755
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

8
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:24,793
Ohhhh‐oh‐OOOOOOH! Sei‐joh!

9
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,328
[Crowd]:
Seijoh!

10
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:30,833
[Seijoh Cheer Leader]:
Ohhhh‐oh‐OOOOOOH! Sei‐joh!

11
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,635
Seijoh!

12
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,805
[Seijoh Cheer Leader]:
Ohhhh‐oh‐OOOOOOH! Sei‐joh!

13
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:39,207
Time to get out there
and finish this!

14
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:40,609
Right!

15
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,545
Kunimi... you ready?

16
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:44,079
Yep.

17
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:47,482
Duuude, I am so proud of you
badass first‐years!

18
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:55,624
Since when does Kunimi know how
to go after a ball like THAT?

19
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,262
[Tobio]:
Don't just let it go!

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,202
[Shoyo]:
Kageyama!

21
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:11,239
Trust me... I'll do the broad
jump as many times as it takes!

22
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:13,609
Right.

23
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:16,144
You ready?

24
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:17,546
Yeah!

25
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:20,683
Tanaka!
We've got
the flow now!

26
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,885
Serve up a
point, Tanaka!

27
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,653
Yeah you know it, bro!

28
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:28,023
They're not
in position!

29
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,558
Come on, block that!

30
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:32,494
Chance ball!

31
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,735
It's a chance ball!

32
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,904
Just one more ball!

33
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,109
[Hajime]:
Good job, Watari!

34
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,277
Number 10
recovers quick!

35
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,215
Nice one‐touch!

36
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,985
[Shoyo]:
Almost there!

37
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:59,421
I know you're
getting the set.

38
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:02,290
[Hajime]:
I'm not gonna
leave you unmarked!

39
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:09,998
He's not jumping as high now!
The timing's off!

40
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:27,550
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

41
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,017
Hinata!

42
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:30,719
See that?!

43
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:33,756
Hinata just saved
our asses big time!

44
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,790
There we go!

45
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,358
It's time
to rush em!

46
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,425
Right!

47
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,828
We've got 'em
in check now!

48
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:42,264
We can still come
back... Stay calm!

49
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:43,999
Sir!

50
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:46,702
[Daichi]:
Give us another
one, Tanaka!

51
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:47,736
Hanamaki!

52
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:48,704
Yup!

53
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:53,776
[Team Seijoh]
(cheering)

54
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,477
[Shimada]:
The score's
still the same...

55
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,312
If Seijoh doesn't
cause a break...

56
00:04:57,412 --> 00:05:00,448
Karasuno still has the
advantage for right now.

57
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,685
That said...

58
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:06,488
[Shimada]:
Oikawa's up to serve at the
worst possible moment!

59
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,563
I will not let you have
control of this game.

60
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:20,969
It's OUR victory. We have
to get to the next round.

61
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:27,776
[Toru]:
I'll beat him... I swear I will!
I'll humiliate that whole team!

62
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:38,353
This one play will put Seijoh
back on top! I know it!

63
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:40,623
[Asahi]:
Nishinoya!

64
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:51,700
Good eye Nishi!
Well done!

65
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,735
Thanks, man!

66
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:57,773
[Seijoh Scorekeeper]:
Wow, I can't believe Oikawa
flubbed a serve.

67
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:00,375
Match point
Karasuno again.

68
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:03,011
So now their hotshot is
messing up his serves...

69
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:05,080
Maybe he's starting
to lose it!

70
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,183
Yeah... even
he's not perfect!

71
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:11,887
The score is even now...

72
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:14,523
At the end of the day,
a point is a point.

73
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:16,291
Iwaizumi is so cool!

74
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:18,727
That makes me
feel inferior...

75
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:21,897
Oh really? So did you think
you were better than me before?

76
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:25,100
Depending on the situation,
there can be a huge difference

77
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,335
between a break point
and a side‐out point.

78
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:31,373
[Irihata]:
But the team places a lot of
value in what Iwaizumi thinks,

79
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:33,341
so his words and actions
have been holding

80
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,478
the team together
since the start.

81
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,682
Wait a second... Did you say
Aoba‐Johsai's never been

82
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,618
to the Nationals before?
They're such a strong team!

83
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:45,721
Yeah, but they're lagging behind
in the grand scheme of things.

84
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:48,123
[Takinoue]:
Both teams are
exhausted physically,

85
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:51,059
but I bet Seijoh's the
most mentally frazzled!

86
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,095
Stay on top
of 'em, guys!

87
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,795
[Haruka]:
Wow!

88
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:28,931
They're past 30 points now!

89
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,799
Both sides
have it rough.

90
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,601
Maybe...

91
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,937
[Takinoue]:
But it seems like Karasuno's
barely keeping the ball in play.

92
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,873
Their attacks feel
kind of uninspired.

93
00:07:37,973 --> 00:07:40,375
That said, the
psychological pressure

94
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:42,545
must be far worse on
Seijoh's side.

95
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:45,347
Serve up a good one, Oikawa!

96
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:48,016
Crap, the rotation's
gone full circle!

97
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:49,552
[Hanamaki]:
Serve's up!

98
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:51,086
[Shimada]:
I'm sure he's still
kicking himself

99
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:52,187
for the serve
he flubbed.

100
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:53,789
Can he handle it?

101
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,159
Oikawa... If you get distracted
worrying about Ushiwaka,

102
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,261
you're gonna get
punched in the face.

103
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:05,534
If you're blind to the opponent
that's right in front of you...

104
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:07,035
then that'll be
the last opponent

105
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,704
that you get to
challenge.

106
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:19,014
I couldn't agree more.

107
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:20,482
One play takes it!

108
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,617
Yeah!

109
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:52,380
[Toru]:
Heads up, it's
a chance ball!

110
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,882
[Hanamaki]:
Right here!

111
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:55,818
Considering how bad he
screwed up the last one,

112
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:59,522
I think that's the best serve
I've seen all day!

113
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,723
Sorry, guys!

114
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:03,626
All that matters is
keeping the ball in the air!

115
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:07,429
Try to stay calm! Don't let a
decoy fool you into jumping!

116
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,165
A quick‐attack? Or maybe
a situation like this

117
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:11,033
calls for their ace!

118
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,635
Over here!

119
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:15,337
The other side?!

120
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:19,508
[Tobio]:
Him again?!

121
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:22,545
[Tobio]:
Kunimi!

122
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,549
They may know you're a decoy...
but you still have to go in!

123
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,783
What for?

124
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:30,619
They could obviously tell
the ball was headed left.

125
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,320
Waste of energy.

126
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,960
You're a good player; why
can't you take this seriously?!

127
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:43,632
What, I'm not serious unless
I'm running myself ragged?

128
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:48,737
Chance ball!

129
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:49,805
[Toru]:
Got it!

130
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,607
He's still got energy?!

131
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:57,312
[Toru]:
I saw you slacking on
your decoy work, Kunimi.

132
00:09:57,412 --> 00:09:58,714
Sorry, I‐

133
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:00,415
At least be sneaky
when you cut corners...

134
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,151
or else Mizoguchi
might yell at you again.

135
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:04,753
HEY! Kunimiiii!

136
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:07,289
The thing about you, Kunimi,
is that you're efficient,

137
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:09,858
and you never do any
more work than necessary.

138
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,195
That said... when the rest
of us are too tired to play...

139
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:15,363
you're going to
make up for it.

140
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,635
A good setter ensures all
of his teammates are working

141
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:23,405
at full power... no matter
who they are! Right?

142
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:25,708
13 again?!

143
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,545
A feint!
Crap!

144
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,583
[Spectator 3]:
Seijoh caught up!

145
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:36,752
And now they've got
match point again!

146
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:39,788
Yeah... and it's
Oikawa's serve.

147
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,392
We were teammates
for 3 whole years.

148
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:47,763
But until now...

149
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:51,634
[Tobio]:
I'd never once seen
Kunimi smile during a game.

150
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,936
Listen, I want to
tell you something.

151
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:55,704
Who are you?

152
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:57,573
Now that I've seen
this side of you...

153
00:10:57,673 --> 00:11:00,108
I don't know if I
can compete with you.

154
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,045
[Shoyo]:
Kageyama? Hello?

155
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:06,114
Kageyama! HEY!

156
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:09,752
Jeez... You're not about
to freak out on me, are you?

157
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:14,089
Listen to me! Obviously
a king is gonna be scared

158
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,525
of a GREAT king! It's right
there in the name!

159
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,494
I mean the guy even LOOKS
way smarter than YOU do!

160
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,130
[Daichi]:
Sorry, Kageyama.

161
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,602
But hey... I promise that I'll
get it back to you next time.

162
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:28,871
[Daichi]:
Then we'll do
what we usually do...

163
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:31,674
and follow your lead
for the attack.

164
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,410
Kageyama! Quit
doubting yourself!

165
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:38,046
What did I tell you before?!

166
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,623
Our guys... are all good.

167
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:52,861
Sure hope His Highness didn't
get spooked by that other king.

168
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,899
He's gonna be alright...

169
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:00,569
Kageyama's not the same lonely
king‐of‐the‐court he used to be.

170
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:30,098
[Seijoh Cheer Leader]:
Let's go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

171
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,500
GO!

172
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,302
COME OOOOOON!

173
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:36,171
We're gonna
get this one!

174
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:37,472
Yeah!

175
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:40,976
[Toru]:
Ugh... Great.

176
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,147
This is quite a bother...

177
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:46,649
[Hajime]:
Serve's up!

178
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:50,418
[Toru]:
Tobio... You're
evolving so quickly.

179
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,556
And I think that
might be my downfall.

180
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:59,394
But...

181
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:04,432
[Crowd]:
OooooooolÃ©!

182
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,568
Front!

183
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:09,838
It's back up!

184
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:12,040
[Takinoue]:
They not gonna make it!
They're out of formation!

185
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,777
[Keishin]:
Just when the pressure of
the game gets you on edge,

186
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,846
a diversion slips
in to trip you up.

187
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:21,349
They are so focused on ripping
the win from our grasp...

188
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:23,185
Over here!
Center!

189
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,386
Left side!

190
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:26,054
Asahi, go!

191
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:29,091
[Hanamaki]:
Keep it in play!
[Toru]:
Iwa!

192
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,260
It's up‐

193
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,697
[Hajime]:
It's all you,
Kindaichi!

194
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:37,900
[Yutaro]:
This kid's got me beat in
speed and reflexes... but!

195
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:44,206
If we're talking about sheer
height... I've got 'em!

196
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:45,407
[Spectator 1]:
It's up!

197
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:46,975
Get it!

198
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,243
It's mine!

199
00:13:48,343 --> 00:13:49,778
You know just
what to do!

200
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:51,079
Yeah!

201
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:52,280
[Asahi]:
Left!

202
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,584
[Tobio]:
Right now!

203
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:56,985
Right here!

204
00:13:57,085 --> 00:14:00,055
This timing... at this angle!

205
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:03,526
It'll be perfect!

206
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:23,612
Tobio Kageyama...

207
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:25,848
You ARE evolving quickly...

208
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,117
and it might very well
be my downfall.

209
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:30,986
But...

210
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:41,830
...not today.

211
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:47,970
(final whistle)

212
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:53,141
[Team Seijoh]:
(cheering)

213
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,081
Let's go...

214
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:06,288
[Daichi]:
Hinata, Kageyama.
Let's line up.

215
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,226
I'm sorry, Captain...

216
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:12,528
You didn't mess up.

217
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:15,130
And there's no need
to be sorry.

218
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,702
Thank you for the game.

219
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:48,496
Listen up guys...
I want to tell you something.

220
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:51,767
The next time Karasuno gets a
chance to do a quick attack...

221
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,503
Kageyama's going to opt
for the super version...

222
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:56,138
I'll bet
you anything.

223
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:58,006
So tell me, how did you know
they'd go for that

224
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:00,008
freak quick attack
at the end?

225
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:02,545
Because Kageyama has
been learning and growing

226
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,913
alongside his
teammates.

227
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:08,116
[Toru]:
He's learned how
to build up a rapport.

228
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:12,020
[Toru]:
During that long rally, his
physical and mental exhaustion

229
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,288
maxed out.

230
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,991
At that moment, his back
was against the wall,

231
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:18,360
and he was faced with an
oh‐so‐vital opportunity.

232
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,097
And for the new and
improved Tobio Kageyama...

233
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,902
...there was only one choice.

234
00:16:28,136 --> 00:16:29,237
Line up!

235
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:31,707
Thank you
for coming!

236
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:33,676
Thank you for coming!

237
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:42,618
Good game, guys!

238
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:44,386
You did your best, guys!

239
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:52,928
Let's go.

240
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,834
Really takes
me back.

241
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,303
Always hated it when people
told us how great we did

242
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:02,470
when we lost.

243
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,439
There was nothin'
I wanted to hear.

244
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,010
But... now that I'm here
on the other side of it...

245
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,645
[Takinoue]:
I gotta be honest...

246
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,980
I dunno what else
to tell 'em

247
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,385
Listen... That
last block was‐

248
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:24,927
We should head out... The next
team needs the court to warm up.

249
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:28,597
We'll have to find
somewhere else to cool down.

250
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:30,833
[Senseki Captain]:
Senseki, fight!

251
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,168
Seijoh will be going
to the quarterfinal...

252
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:35,337
after they take
a little break.

253
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,012
[Senseki Captain]:
Senseki, fight!

254
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:47,149
Fight, fight, fight!
[Team Senseki]:
Fight, fight, fight!

255
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:51,319
I'm surprised you
didn't tell them

256
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,922
it takes more than
one guy to win. I mean...

257
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:56,424
that's what you said
a while back, isn't it?

258
00:17:56,525 --> 00:18:01,063
Well, Karasuno isn't a
one‐man show... I was wrong.

259
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,631
'Cause you're
a dumbass.

260
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:04,199
Oh, come on!

261
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,735
[Toru]:
During that last play
in the 2nd set,

262
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,871
Kageyama guessed that
I'd send it to you...

263
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,073
That proved to me
that he was finally changing

264
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,276
from a dictator
into a real leader.

265
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:17,279
At the time, I knew it was
a possibility that he'd give

266
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:19,848
the ball to the shorty,
even if he was still acting

267
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:22,751
like a dictator,
but it wasn't a sure thing.

268
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,753
I didn't realize the
difference for certain

269
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,122
until later on
in the game.

270
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:29,357
As soon as he showed me
that he could read my attack,

271
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:31,560
that gave me the
opportunity to turn around

272
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,828
and read HIS attack, too.

273
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,663
You know what
that means...

274
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:38,834
Our little Kageyama's finally
learned how to trust people.

275
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:45,140
And... that... makes
me even more annoyed.

276
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:01,189
It's time for
the meeting.

277
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,066
Sorry.

278
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:15,237
[Tobio]:
Oikawa read me like a book.

279
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:22,878
Don't you apologize!

280
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:24,880
Shut up!

281
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,515
Stop making it
sound like setting

282
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,483
the ball to ME
was a mistake!

283
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,389
The meeting's about
to start, you two.

284
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:41,196
You two played an amazing game
today... You know that right?

285
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:45,467
Yeah... but we lost.

286
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:47,102
Yes, I know you did...

287
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:50,873
But still... Would you
call it a waste of time?

288
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,613
Do you think losing
means you're weak?

289
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,718
If you think about it...
losing is a trial by fire.

290
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:04,386
To see if you can
get back up...

291
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:08,456
after you've been
knocked to the ground.

292
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:11,393
But if you guys just stay
lying down forever...

293
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:14,429
then I'd say...
that makes you weak.

294
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:04,940
Hey... let's get some food...
Don't worry I'm buyin'.

295
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,776
What? You're treating us?
But sir, we‐

296
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:09,712
Just do what
I tell ya.

297
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:20,589
[Keishin]:
Sorry to drop in so late.

298
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:26,061
Not at all! You used to come
in right at close all the time.

299
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,603
You kids worked really hard
out there today...

300
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:38,240
And all that strenuous activity
has worn down your muscles.

301
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,144
By now, you're probably
all in pretty bad shape.

302
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:47,449
[Keishin]:
You build it back up with food.
That's how you gain muscle mass.

303
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,519
This will make you stronger.

304
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,189
Now dig in... You've all
earned a good meal.

305
00:22:57,726 --> 00:22:59,327
Thanks for the food.

306
00:22:59,427 --> 00:23:00,796
Thank you.

307
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:01,897
Thanks for the food.

308
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:04,833
Ah... Enjoy!

309
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:08,637
Thank you for the food.

310
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,205
Go on guys.

311
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:45,641
[Keishin]:
Eat.

312
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:49,144
Fill yourselves up...

313
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:51,880
And enjoy it.

314
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:55,117
And slowly...

315
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:58,854
Slowly, but surely...

316
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:04,793
You will get stronger.

317
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,998
[Takeda]:
I'll pick up
the check, Coach.

318
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:12,467
[Keishin]:
Hey, don't sweat it,
Specs... Check please!

319
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,770
[Lady Chef]:
Here we are.
I gave you a discount.

320
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,107
[Keishin]:
Thanks... WHOA! Damn,
those boys can put it away!

321
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,210
Next Haikyu!!
"The Third Day."

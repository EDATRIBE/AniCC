00:00:05,026 --> 00:00:09,597
[TOBIO]
(heavy breathing)

2
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:21,342
[TOBIO]
(sprint) (set)

3
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:24,712
[TOBIO]
You're not fast enough!
Can't you jump any higher?!

4
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:28,082
[TOBIO] More.. more.. more!

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,117
(gasp)

6
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:38,960
[TOBIO] Why? Why
didn't you jump?
[OTHERS] (scoff)

7
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,265
[YUTARO]
'Cause we've had enough of your
crap... Mr. "King of the Court."

8
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:48,002
Gah!
(ALARM beeping)

9
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:50,505
[TOBIO]
(gasp)(breath)

10
00:00:52,674 --> 00:00:54,141
[TOBIO] Tch!

11
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:59,280
[KIYOKO] Good morning,
everybody.
[RYUNOSUKE] (gasp)
[CHIKARA] Hello, there.

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,949
[SHOYO] Hey look!
It's that pretty girl!
[RYUNOSUKE] You're looking as
beautiful as ever, Kiyoko!

13
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:05,653
[SHOYO] So do you think she's
the team manager or something?
[RYUNOSUKE] Ah yeah,
ignoring me!

14
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:07,622
[DAICHI] Alright,
let's get started.
[SHOYO] Huh?

15
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:09,791
I'll play on Tsukishima's team
to make it three‐on‐three.

16
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:12,259
[SHOYO]
Huh?! Is that
fair though?!

17
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,662
(laugh) Don't worry,
of course it is.

18
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:16,564
Tanaka's got a lot more
attack power than me.

19
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:19,133
[DAICHI] I won't go
easy on you though.
[RYUNOSUKE] (annoyed)

20
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:26,240
Well, ahem... The buzzcut or
the shorty, Who to crush...
I mean, challenge first?
[TADASHI] (nervous)

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,042
[SHOYO] (shocked)
[RYUNOSUKE] (listen)

22
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:29,644
So hard to choose...

23
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:32,046
but I do know I'd like to
save His Highness for last.

24
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:36,083
[DAICHI] (sigh)
[TADASHI] Uh... Tsukki?...
They can hear you... Be careful.

25
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:41,488
I know, genius, I want them to
hear me... I can't wait to watch
the King fall apart out there.

26
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:44,959
Well now... You've got
quite a personality
there, don't you?

27
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:47,829
[KEI]
It'll have to be a pretty great
show to top watching him

28
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:50,732
get abandoned by all of his
loyal subjects last year.

29
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:53,601
[TOBIO] (annoyed) Hm?
[RYUNOSUKE] Well, well!

30
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:57,171
Didja hear that, you guys?
They're talking trash now...

31
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:01,242
That jerk had better..
just.. stepppp oooooff!

32
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:03,110
(RYUNOSUKE growling)

33
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,314
[TOBIO] (shocked)
[RYUNOSUKE] Or he's dead meat.
[SHOYO] Blegh!

34
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:42,309
(whistle blowing)

35
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,445
[RYUNOSUKE]
(battle scream)

36
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:47,915
[SHOYO] (thrilled)
[HISASHI] He just got it right
past that giant first‐year guy!

37
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:49,917
[SHOYO, internal]
He's even stronger than usual!

38
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:52,319
YYYEAAAAAHHHH!

39
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:55,256
(wild cheering under)
[KOSHI] Put your shirt on!
[CHIKARA] Yeah, calm down!
[HISASHI] Nobody wants to see

40
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:58,660
This is what happens when
you get Tanaka too worked up.

41
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,861
Tch!

42
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:01,295
[KEI]
Heh, so little...

43
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:02,163
[TOBIO]
Front!

44
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:03,297
Got it!

45
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:05,066
(internal) Hey,
I can do that too!

46
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,367
[TOBIO]
Hinata!

47
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:07,835
[SHOYO, internal]
That's my set!

48
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:11,405
This'll be my very first spike
in a high school game!

49
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:14,976
[KIYOKO] Hm?
[HISASHI CHIKARA KOSHI]
(watching)

50
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:16,678
[SHOYO, internal]
I'm gonna score!

51
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:27,922
[SHOYO, internal]
There's another wall in my
way... a big.. big wall.

52
00:04:28,022 --> 00:04:31,959
You took me by surprise
before... You have a really
nice jump there...

53
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:35,797
Now if only you were about a
foot taller, you'd be a real
superstar.

54
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:38,666
[SHOYO] (annoyed) (grunt)
[KEI] Better start taking your
vitamins.

55
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:40,902
[SHOYO, internal]
He's only one guy!

56
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:42,436
Whatever! One more!

57
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:44,305
[SHOYO]
I got this one for sure!

58
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:46,608
(surprised)

59
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,443
[KOSHI] Blocked again.
[CHIKARA] How many times
is that?

60
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:51,746
[TADASHI] Nice one, Tsukki!
[HISASHI] Tanaka's getting
a lot through, though.

61
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:54,716
[DAICHI] Nice block, Tsukishima!
[SHOYO] Ah, man.

62
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:58,319
[KEI] Thanks.
[TOBIO, internal] Damn...
He's better than I thought.

63
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,288
You better snap out of it,
buddy, or you're going to
keep getting blocked.

64
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:06,260
Why not give him one of your
royal sets... The kind that
wipes out your opponents...

65
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,230
[KEI]
AND your teammates
at the same time!

66
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,365
[TOBIO]
Shut your mouth.

67
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:13,034
[DAICHI]
Your serve, Tadashi!

68
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:16,037
(whistle)
[TADASHI] (serve) Agh!

69
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:19,240
[KEI] Tch!
[TADASHI] Uh...
oops... Sorry, Tsukki.

70
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,709
(whistle)
[DAICHI] Shake it off!

71
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,079
[TOBIO]
We don't need quick attacks.

72
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:27,515
Time to win.

73
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,852
Alright you got this! Do it!

74
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:34,522
[KOSHI, internal]
I remember Kageyama's jump
serve, it was pretty amazing.

75
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:37,424
[TOBIO, internal]
I can score all the
points we need!

76
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:38,793
[TOBIO] Ha!

77
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:40,027
(receive)

78
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:41,295
[SHOYO]
(shock)

79
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:43,064
[KEI] Tadashi!
[TADASHI] Leave it to me!

80
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:44,498
(fumble)

81
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:46,634
[TOBIO] (pissed) Damn.
[TADASHI] Nice toss, Tsukki!

82
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:49,370
[RYUNOSUKE] Steady receives
like that are Daichi's
specialty.
[DAICHI] You're doing great.

83
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,639
[RYUNOSUKE]
They've got mad defense.

84
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:53,808
Did you think I would
be a weak spot?

85
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:57,411
(TOBIO surprised)
[DAICHI] I may not have as much
raw talent as you,

86
00:05:57,512 --> 00:06:01,315
but I've been training on
receives for a lot longer
than you have.

87
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:02,550
(surprised)

88
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,552
You won't break
through that easily.

89
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:06,521
[SHOYO, internal]
Wow, he sounds cool.

90
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:08,656
[TOBIO] (seething) Hm?
[KEI] Your Grace!

91
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:10,892
Shouldn't you be
taking this seriously?

92
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:14,195
Dude, what's the matter
with you?! Why do you
keep picking on the guy?!

93
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:16,197
Chill out with the
freakin' nickname!

94
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:20,768
What for? Do you even know
why everybody started calling
him the King of the Court?

95
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:23,938
[SHOYO]
(confused) I thought his
enemies called him that...

96
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:27,609
because he's really good
player... and well everybody
was so afraid of him.

97
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,879
[KEI] (laugh) That's a
commonly misunderstanding,
but it's just not true.
[SHOYO] (surprised) Huh?

98
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,950
Well, if the rumors are to be
believed, then his nickname
King of the Court...

99
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,020
was given to him by the other
players of Kitagawa First...

100
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,057
Yeah, that's right, by his own
teammates... The truth is...

101
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:47,361
[KEI]
They were not paying him
a compliment, but calling
him a tyrant.

102
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:52,266
I've been hearing about it for a
long time... but now that I've
seen him play, I'm convinced...

103
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:56,470
He got benched at the finals
because he was a domineering,
power‐tripping dictator.

104
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:04,211
[SHOYO RYUNOSUKE] Hm?
[CROWD](distant) Kita Go!
Kita Go! Kita Go! Kita Go!

105
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:05,212
(TOBIO hit)

106
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:06,380
(whistle)

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,715
[KOUSEN] Alright!
(CROWD cheers)

108
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:09,617
[TOBIO, internal]
Grr, they block so high!

109
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:12,419
(KOUSEN cheering)
[TOBIO] I'll have to use a
faster attack to shake them off.

110
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,222
[TOBIO] Something they won't
be able to get to in time.
[AKIRA] Hey, it's okay.

111
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:17,358
[YUTARO] I guess.
[TOBIO] Move faster!

112
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,292
[YUTARO] Tch!

113
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:19,827
[KOUSEN 7]
Our serve!

114
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:21,929
[YUTARO]
Go right!

115
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,131
[SCORER] (surprised)
(whistle)

116
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:24,999
(cheers)
[KOUSEN 7] Nice!

117
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:26,000
Cut it out!

118
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,969
Can't you set it like
a normal person?

119
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,671
[YUTARO]
What's the point if
we can't hit it?!

120
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:31,105
[KOUSEN 4]
One more to go, you guys!

121
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:33,541
[TOBIO, internal]
If I can't shake their blockers,

122
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:35,042
we'll never win!

123
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:40,081
Is this the end? Is this
how we're gonna lose?

124
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:43,017
No! I have to go to nationals!

125
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:46,420
If your sorry asses ever
expect to win anything,

126
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:48,990
you'd better learn to
adapt to the way I set!

127
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,224
(realize)

128
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,126
Huh?

129
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:55,630
(sigh)

130
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,932
[TOBIO] End of the first set.

131
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:01,736
Set point for the opponent.
I set the ball up.

132
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:03,037
(gasp)

133
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:08,209
But no one was there to hit it.

134
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:12,479
[TOBIO]
We had messed up several
combinations that day...

135
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,116
but that was not a mistake.

136
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,085
[TOBIO]
It was a rebellion.

137
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:22,924
They wanted to make it
absolutely clear that
they were done with me.

138
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,760
Kageyama.
Huh?

139
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,395
[COACH]
It's time for you to go back to
the bench.

140
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:31,032
(shaky breath)

141
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:33,167
[KEI]
That's why you won't
try a quick attack.

142
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:36,538
You're still shaken up over
what happened that day.

143
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:40,775
[RYUNOSUKE]
You know what, I've had
enough of your smarmy ass‐

144
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,677
[DAICHI] Tanaka.
[RYUNOSUKE] Huh?

145
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:45,446
(sigh)

146
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:48,149
Well, why bother
setting if there's no
one there to spike it?

147
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:50,051
[TOBIO] You're right.
[RYUNOSUKE KEI] Hm?

148
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:52,787
[TOBIO] (exhale)

149
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:56,758
The thought of nobody being
there to back me up...

150
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:59,160
it terrifies me, alright?

151
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:03,698
[SHOYO]
Yeah, but that was
back in middle school.

152
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,436
Your sets are gonna reach
me... no question about it.

153
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:11,105
(quiet surprised)

154
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:12,339
After that..

155
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:14,642
the only problem is how to
get it past this jerkhole!

156
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:16,644
[DAICHI] (laugh)
[RYUNOSUKE] (chuckle)

157
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:20,748
You need to kick Tsukishima's
ass, join the volleyball club
and become the setter,

158
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:25,386
just like we planned! Then you
have to send the ball to me!
It's not that complicated!

159
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:27,488
(annoyed)

160
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:32,627
Oh shut up... That over‐the‐top
annoying little attitude of
yours... is disgusting.

161
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:34,829
[RYUNOSUKE] Hm?
[DAICHI] Hm? (concerned)
(whistle)

162
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:37,932
[KEI] And enthusiasm won't
make you any taller.

163
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:40,868
If you think trying hard is
all it takes to succeed...

164
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:43,738
...you're sorely mistaken.

165
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:47,675
[RYUNOSUKE] I got this, to you!
Give it back, give it back!
[SHOYO] Tanaka!
Give it to me now!

166
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,911
[TOBIO] Who do I send it to?
[SHOYO] Over here!
[RYUNOSUKE] I'm open!

167
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:52,279
[TOBIO] I don't know that
Hinata can beat this guy.
[RYUNOSUKE] Come on, this way!

168
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:53,247
Tanaka!

169
00:09:53,347 --> 00:09:54,281
[SHOYO]
Kageyama!

170
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:55,382
(surprised)

171
00:09:58,452 --> 00:09:59,854
[TOBIO]
No one... was there.

172
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,057
I'm here!

173
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:08,462
Gah!

174
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:09,296
Arglgh!

175
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:10,197
(whistle)

176
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:11,032
(grunt)

177
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,466
That was close...

178
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,869
Almost jumped at nothing...
But it's out.

179
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:16,504
[TOBIO] (shocked)
What the hell was that for?!

180
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,940
[SHOYO] The ball came
right towards me!
[TOBIO] (surprised)

181
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,042
[SHOYO]
I don't care about what happened
in middle school!

182
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,477
I'm grateful for any
set that comes my way!

183
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:25,212
I just want the ball!

184
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:30,818
[SHOYO]
I'll jump anywhere! I'll hit
any ball! Believe me!

185
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,889
Give me a set...
And I'll hit it!

186
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,847
[KOSHI, internal]
Kageyama planned to throw
that to Tanaka, I know it.

187
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:06,688
But when he picked up on
Hinata's voice and movement,
he tossed to him with perfect
accuracy.

188
00:11:06,788 --> 00:11:10,057
[KOSHI, internal]
He might have a sharp tongue
and a bad attitude...

189
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:12,794
but he really is something else.

190
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:15,997
You guys can do quick attacks
and you didn't tell me?!

191
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:17,031
What's that?

192
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:19,133
That crazy‐fast
attack you just did!

193
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:24,405
Uh? Uh‐uh... No... The
only sets I've ever hit
were way up in the air.

194
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:26,107
You literally just did it!

195
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,175
[RYUNOSUKE]
Look, remember in middle school

196
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:31,513
when that rookie setter messed
up that set and you hit it
anyway? Like that!

197
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:34,582
[SHOYO]
Huh? But I don't even
remember how I did it.

198
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:36,017
[RYUNOSUKE] (sigh)

199
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:38,419
Whatever, I'll still hit
any set that comes at me!

200
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,587
You just wait and see!

201
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:41,322
[TOBIO] (uneasy)

202
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:44,191
You've never done combos before,
so that's impossible for you.

203
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:49,764
[SHOYO, internal] (shocked)
Impossible?! Does he even hear
himself right now?!

204
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:54,068
Don't be ridiculous! YOU
don't get to act like a
wimp! Just stop it!

205
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:54,736
Ugh.

206
00:11:54,836 --> 00:11:56,871
Uh...

207
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,306
Not very regal of you, sire.

208
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:02,143
(angry) You're gonna pay
for that I promise you!

209
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,946
Look at that... getting all
bent out of shape again.

210
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:07,749
[KEI]
You can't just bulldoze
your way through everything.
You know that, right?

211
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:09,250
Hm?

212
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,886
Not everyone's a good fit
for every job, you know.

213
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:14,121
[KEI]
I mean, you're clearly not
cut out to be a spiker.

214
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:15,523
[SHOYO]
(surprised)

215
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:16,724
[RYUNOSUKE] (enraged)

216
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,259
[DAICHI] (grab)
[RYUNOSUKE] (listen)

217
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,928
[SHOYO]
You're right.
In middle school...

218
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:25,967
even now... no matter how much
I jump, I always get blocked.

219
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,603
[SHOYO]
Height is important
for volleyball...

220
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:32,974
You can't always just jump
real high to make up for
being short like me.

221
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:36,343
[SHOYO]
But still...

222
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:39,180
[SHOYO]
...that never stopped me from
wanting to be a spiker.

223
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:44,552
[SHOYO]
I don't care whether
I'm cut out for it or not.

224
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:48,690
[SHOYO]
I'll do the best I can with what
I've got and I'll win!

225
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,559
I'm on this court and
I'm not going anywhere.

226
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,468
[SHOYO]
No.

227
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:03,070
[TOBIO]
I'm not leaving...

228
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,440
[SHOYO TOBIO]
I want to stay on
the court the longest!

229
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,377
[KEI] (sigh)

230
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:13,014
Have you even listened
to a word I've said?

231
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:15,249
It doesn't really work
that way, shorty.

232
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:17,852
[KEI]
You can't substitute
spirit for height.

233
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:20,154
Unless you want to be
a libero, that is.

234
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:23,057
[SHOYO]
Give a set and I'll hit it!

235
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:31,198
[TOBIO]
I open up the wall and
block the spiker.

236
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:35,970
That's the setter's job!

237
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,204
(surprised)

238
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:38,405
(surprised)

239
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:41,242
(confused)

240
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:44,612
(yanked) Whoa, what
gives, Kageyama?!

241
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:47,048
[SHOYO] Gah, let go!
You're hurting me!
[RYUNOSUKE] Hey man,
could you chill?!

242
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:49,216
[SHOYO] (released)
What the‐Gah!

243
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:52,086
[TOBIO]
Listen up. If you
can't make the shot...

244
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:56,490
then I want you to go
around them and hit my
sets with all the power
and agility you've got.

245
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:59,060
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh?!... That's how you explain
quick attacks?!

246
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,262
[SHOYO] Got it.
[RYUNOSUKE] There is
no way you got that!

247
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:03,264
[SHOYO TOBIO]
We have to give it a try!

248
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:07,134
What's with you? Not 2
minutes ago you were
nothin' but doom and gloom.

249
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:09,003
I was not.
You lie!

250
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:12,540
[SHOYO] Okay...
Ready to go!
[TADASHI] Serve it!

251
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,244
[TOBIO, internal]
He should have the speed and
reflexes to hit a quick set.

252
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:21,248
[SHOYO, internal]
Bring it on, Kageyama!
Show me what you've got!

253
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:26,287
[TADASHI] Go, Tsukki!
[TOBIO, internal] We haven't
established any signals,
so for now...

254
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:31,025
[SHOYO, internal]
Got it, so he's gonna
set it that way.

255
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,795
[RYUNOSUKE] Nice!
[SHOYO, internal] That's weaker
than Mrs. Yoshida's serve...

256
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:37,732
[RYUNOSUKE] Nice receive!
[SHOYO] Once it comes my way,
I'll just‐ Ggh!

257
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:39,100
Ah...

258
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:42,136
[SHOYO]
Oh. Faster than I thought.

259
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:44,271
[TOBIO]
How'd you miss that!
You have to‐

260
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:46,107
(troubled)

261
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:47,842
Nice ball, Your Highness!

262
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:49,076
(angry)

263
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:51,045
Nothing ever works out
on the first try!

264
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:53,080
[KEI]
Hey, that's what losers say.

265
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,783
[SHOYO]
Hwph! Gaaah!

266
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:57,952
[SHOYO]
Gwah! I touched it that ti‐ Oof!

267
00:14:58,052 --> 00:14:59,987
(gurgling struggle)

268
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:01,355
[RYUNOSUKE]
You look like a fish!

269
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:05,226
(weary) I can't guess
your timing at all.

270
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:09,531
[TOBIO]
You have lightning‐fast
reflexes! You just need to give
it more "pow!" More "oomph!"

271
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,633
[SHOYO]
Is it oomph or pow?!
Make up your mind!

272
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,701
[RYUNOSUKE]
Don't get caught up
in the terminology!

273
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:14,869
[KOSHI] Kageyama.

274
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:16,437
[TOBIO RYUNOSUKE] (look)
[SHOYO] Hm?

275
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:19,373
You need to make sure you don't
let history repeat itself.

276
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:21,909
Uhh... What I mean is, uh...

277
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,546
He's got super fast
reflexes and uh...

278
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:27,481
he can jump! He can learn
how to quick attack!

279
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:30,317
That's not really what I'm
getting at though...

280
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,720
I think I know how you guys
can be more effective.

281
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,088
Hmmm?

282
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,390
Hinata doesn't really
know what he's doing.

283
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,225
[SHOYO] (stunned)
That's kinda harsh...

284
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:39,894
He doesn't have technique or
experience

285
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:42,429
like a lot of the people
you competed against in
middle school.

286
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,465
[SHOYO] (bummed)
[KOSHI] But he's a rare asset.

287
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:48,169
[SHOYO]
Huh?! Really?! Aww come on, I'm
not like a genius or anything...

288
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:49,737
[RYUNOSUKE] Who said THAT?
(SHOYO awkwardly laughs)

289
00:15:49,837 --> 00:15:52,907
[KOSHI]
If I had your skill...
I mean, think about it...

290
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:57,745
Maybe YOU should
try adapting to more of Hinata's
characteristics instead of the
other way around,

291
00:15:57,845 --> 00:15:59,714
don't you see what I'm
saying? Then...

292
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:01,382
[TOBIO] (surprised)
[RYUNOSUKE] Take it easy, Suga!

293
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,751
It's up to you to use his
talents more effectively!

294
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:06,888
(thinking)

295
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:11,793
[KOSHI]
I'm a setter like you, so I was
honestly pretty freaked out when
I saw you play last year.

296
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:15,997
You've got incredible talent and
control over the ball...

297
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:22,704
But most of all, you're good
at analyzing the opponent's
blocking moves and you make
decisions on the fly.

298
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:25,406
I've got... none
of those things.

299
00:16:25,507 --> 00:16:27,208
Don't you say
crap like that‐

300
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:29,343
Hold on... Just
let him talk, okay?

301
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,012
(uneasy)

302
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:34,649
[KOSHI]
You're good at what you do
and have almost TOO much
determination...

303
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:38,820
but your ability to assess
your surroundings is your
most important skill.

304
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,422
So pay closer attention
to your allies!

305
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:42,289
Hm?

306
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:43,525
Hup!

307
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,064
[TOBIO, internal]
Use HIS talents more
effectively?!

308
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:52,333
The ball came right towards me!

309
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:57,171
[TOBIO] (glare)
[SHOYO] (startled) Hm?

310
00:16:57,271 --> 00:16:58,806
[RYUNOSUKE]
("I‐don't‐know" mumble)

311
00:16:58,906 --> 00:16:59,674
[TOBIO]
Listen...

312
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:00,975
Uh! Uh‐huh?!

313
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:03,344
I'm jealous of your crazy
reflexes, alright?

314
00:17:03,444 --> 00:17:04,411
Huh?!

315
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:05,312
That's right...

316
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:06,548
That's why you piss me off;

317
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:07,381
it's such a waste!

318
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:08,049
[SHOYO] HUH?!

319
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:08,950
[TOBIO]
That said!

320
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,084
All I can do now

321
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:11,919
is use your talent
to the fullest!

322
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:13,420
(stunned)

323
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:14,689
What the?

324
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:15,857
(focused)

325
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:18,059
You're gonna run at full
speed...

326
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:21,228
and you're gonna jump
as high as you can.

327
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:23,097
[TOBIO]
I'll deliver the ball to you!

328
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:26,568
(confused) What do you mean
by... "deliver the ball"?

329
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:30,104
[TOBIO]
All you have to do is jump at
max height and max speed

330
00:17:30,204 --> 00:17:33,541
wherever there's an opening..
and swing at full power.

331
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:37,512
Forget adjusting to the
ball... You don't even
need to see the ball.

332
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:40,414
Huh?! How can I hit if
I don't even see it?!

333
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:41,849
[TOBIO] I don't know!
[SHOYO] What?!

334
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,451
Just... try, okay?

335
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:48,322
Alright.

336
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,858
What are those two
plotting over there?

337
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,061
I mean, no one wants to deal
His Majesty's selfish ways.

338
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:55,362
[TADASHI] Exactly.

339
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:57,231
[KOSHI, internal]
Hope they've got a plan...

340
00:17:57,331 --> 00:18:01,769
Hinata's not gonna be able to
adjust to those tosses without
some practice.

341
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:03,771
[TADASHI]
Let's go! One point!

342
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:06,140
(inhale, exhale)

343
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:12,880
[RYUNOSUKE]
He's in the zone.

344
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,115
(whistle)

345
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:17,351
[TOBIO, internal]
See now.

346
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:20,021
[TOBIO]
Where are the blockers?
Where's the ball?

347
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:23,758
Where's the spiker?
What's his next move?

348
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:28,596
Where will he jump,
and how high is he going to go?

349
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:33,334
[TOBIO]
Now! This position!
This angle! This moment!

350
00:18:34,702 --> 00:18:35,803
[KEI]
(gasp)

351
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,904
Yes!

352
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:38,472
(breath)

353
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:41,676
[SHOYO]
Ah... Whoa...

354
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:44,879
I... I touched the ball!
(blissful laughter)

355
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,480
It wasn't that great...

356
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:48,149
[DAICHI] Guys...

357
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:51,218
He just did that...
with his eyes closed.

358
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:52,854
[KEI RYUNOSUKE TOBIO]
Huh?!

359
00:18:52,954 --> 00:18:54,789
What?! No way!

360
00:18:57,391 --> 00:19:01,328
[DAICHI]
From the moment his feet
left the floor to the
second he swung his arm,

361
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:03,397
Hinata's eyes were closed.

362
00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:07,068
Kageyama just made a pinpoint
toss into Hinata's hand,

363
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:09,704
but Hinata wasn't even
looking at the ball!

364
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:14,408
I don't know how he did it,
but his timing was perfect!

365
00:19:16,077 --> 00:19:17,278
Huh?

366
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:18,813
[SHOYO]
That's awesome!

367
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:20,214
You guys! I dunno what happened,

368
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,784
but I just hit something!
Did you see that?! Huh?!

369
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:25,887
Hey! What'd you do?!
Your eyes weren't really
shut, were they?!

370
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:28,489
Um, well you're the one who told
me not to look at the ball!

371
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,358
[SHOYO]
If I kept my eyes open,
I knew I would look at it.

372
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,994
I wasn't telling you to...

373
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:36,130
[SHOYO]
But... but it worked, right?
What's the big deal?

374
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,002
[TOBIO] I
know it worked... but what
kind of person acts totally
on trust?!

375
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:45,172
I can't help it! Trust is the
only way I know how to do it!

376
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:51,412
[TOBIO]
What have you been wasting all
your time on for three years?!

377
00:19:51,513 --> 00:19:54,949
[TOBIO, internal] His mobility
and jumping power...
[RYUNOSUKE] That was crazy!
Nice one, dude!

378
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:58,085
[TOBIO, internal] My sets can
enhance that!
[RYUNOSUKE] (laughter)

379
00:19:58,185 --> 00:20:04,425
Tanaka, if we can score with
Hinata's spike, then our
marks'll scatter and make it
easier for you to strike too.

380
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:05,960
[SHOYO] Yeah!
[RYUNOSUKE] Right on!

381
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,294
Look, I know we don't have

382
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,896
any special trust built
up or anything...

383
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,431
[SHOYO] Huh?
[RYUNOSUKE] Hm?

384
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:14,869
...but I'll deliver the next
ball to you. So jump, okay?

385
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:16,470
(nod)

386
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:20,141
[TOBIO]
Here!

387
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:21,308
(swing, fall)

388
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:22,877
[TOBIO]
Sorry.

389
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:25,146
[CHIKARA]
Hmm... I guess that first time
was a fluke.

390
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:28,950
Yeah, but I can tell
their precision's already
starting to improve.

391
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,918
Uh? You really think so?
Mm‐hm.

392
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:33,020
[CHIKARA] That was a
nice one, Hinata.
[TOBIO] Man...

393
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,156
[TOBIO] Too far away
from the net that time.
[SHOYO] Oh hey, thanks a lot.

394
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:36,257
[SHOYO] That hurt...

395
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:37,925
[TOBIO]
This really is tough...

396
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,994
Keeping up with
everything that happens
[KIYOKO] Are you okay?

397
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:43,965
on the court is
exhausting... but...
[SHOYO] Ah! Y‐yes ma'am!

398
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:45,032
[TOBIO]
...it's fun!

399
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:46,734
What're you smiling about?!

400
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:49,236
This is the second time I've
been smacked in the face!

401
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:55,710
I'm not buying it... That had to
be a one‐time thing... why
are they even still trying it?

402
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,045
Well guess what... Hinata's
probably gonna jump

403
00:20:58,145 --> 00:21:00,848
without looking at the ball
about a million more times.

404
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:03,751
[SHOYO] I'm starting to think
you do this on purpose.
[DAICHI] You're right though,
it is pretty unbelievable...

405
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:06,053
[SHOYO] You do know
we have to win, right?
[DAICHI] It's difficult
to trust another person 100%.

406
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:08,523
[TOBIO] Of course I do!

407
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:11,358
[DAICHI]
Especially your sworn enemy.

408
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:16,964
Aw maaaan, it's
not working... But...

409
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:19,400
[SHOYO, internal]
I definitely felt
it that one time...

410
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,469
I felt the heaviness of
the core of the ball.

411
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:25,607
[SHOYO, internal]
I really like that feeling.

412
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,243
[SHOYO, internal]
Just one more try.

413
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:35,149
[TOBIO, internal]
More carefully this time. A set
that gives the spiker the chance
to use maximum force.

414
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,784
(whistle)

415
00:21:36,884 --> 00:21:39,554
[RYUNOSUKE] Got it! Here!
[TOBIO] Nice receive!

416
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:41,723
Looks like he gave it to
short‐stack by mistake...

417
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:44,859
Let's just keep our eyes
on the skinhead fella.

418
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:45,993
(gasp) Hey Tadashi!

419
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:47,529
[TADASHI]
Oh!

420
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:49,797
[SHOYO]
The wall!

421
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:52,934
Listen up... If you
can't make the shot...

422
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:55,036
[SHOYO]
Go around!

423
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:57,505
(surprised)

424
00:21:57,605 --> 00:22:00,575
[SHOYO, internal]
I'm shorter than the
tall players.

425
00:22:00,675 --> 00:22:04,478
So I need that extra inch,
that extra second...

426
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:07,414
[SHOYO, internal]
...to reach the peak!

427
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:10,384
For this one single
moment in time...

428
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:12,587
I'm at the highest point!

429
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:18,526
[SHOYO, internal]
There's a big, tall wall in
front of me, blocking my way.

430
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:23,865
I wonder what's waiting on the
other side? What's the view like
over there?

431
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:27,101
It's something I'll never
be able to see on my own.

432
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:28,936
It's the view...

433
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:34,509
[SHOYO, internal]
...from the summit.

434
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:35,843
[DAICHI] (slide)

435
00:22:50,057 --> 00:22:51,593
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Yes!

436
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:26,554
[RYUNOSUKE]
You can't just spike with your
eyes closed! Who ARE you?!

437
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:27,889
[KEI]
I don't believe this.

438
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:29,657
[KOSHI]
This is getting
kinda crazy, huh?

439
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:32,193
[SHOYO]
Send me the next one too,
would ya? (smacked)

440
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:33,394
[TOBIO]
Calm down!

441
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:35,730
[SHOYO]
Aww... Anyway, next Haikyu:

442
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,665
"The First Time Jitters."

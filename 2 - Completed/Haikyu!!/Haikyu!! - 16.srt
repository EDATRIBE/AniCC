1
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:09,941
Oooh!

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,512
That's our dynamic duo!

3
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:15,714
[Komaki]:
Oh, well...
Good try, man!

4
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:18,116
[Haga]:
Hang in there!

5
00:00:18,216 --> 00:00:21,586
Hm... looks like they're
not doing that quick attack.

6
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:23,888
The one where he
closes his eyes.

7
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,225
They still need work...

8
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:29,427
but it looks to me as if
they're able to execute

9
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:32,330
a normal quick
attack now instead.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,299
It's sloppy, but at
least they've got control

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,968
over the trajectory.

12
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:40,138
That's a big
difference...

13
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,341
Those kids must have had quite
a productive practice game.

14
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:46,210
[Irihata]:
They've learned their
weapons, built them up,

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,312
and figured out how
to use the right attack

16
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:50,615
for the
right situation.

17
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:53,017
Hmmm... Well,
how about that?

18
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:56,154
They used to rely on raw power
to score their points.

19
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:58,156
[Irihata]:
Now they're
getting smart.

20
00:00:58,256 --> 00:00:59,758
[Tamagawa]:
One more!

21
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:04,428
Yeah, but they still make
a lot of rookie mistakes.

22
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:06,097
Can't argue with that.

23
00:01:06,197 --> 00:01:09,033
But receives are the one thing
you can't perfect overnight.

24
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,334
[Ikejiri]:
Your serve, Chaya!

25
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:11,703
[Tamagawa]:
One more!

26
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:14,706
[Ryunosuke]:
Noya!

27
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:24,983
[Team Karasuno]:
Yeah!

28
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,686
Are these guys actually
about to win the set?

29
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:30,822
Yeah, that libero's
not playing around, dude...

30
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:32,456
And not just that...

31
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:34,659
I think that guy with the
stubble is really helping

32
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,761
support Kageyama's sets.

33
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:39,130
It's alright.

34
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,465
Yeah... let's just
get ourselves a point.

35
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:43,334
Okay!

36
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:45,003
[Daichi]:
One more, guys!

37
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:49,373
Give us a good serve, Hinata!

38
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:51,342
[Shoyo]:
Yes, sir!

39
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:52,376
[Ryunosuke]:
We got this!

40
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:53,745
[Shoyo]:
Yeah!

41
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:30,341
(final whistle)

42
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:32,410
[Team]:
We did it!

43
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:35,046
[Ikejiri]:
It was our biggest tournament
in middle school.

44
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,516
We won the first
game by dumb luck.

45
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:40,619
But in the second round, we
were up against a team we knew

46
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,220
we couldn't beat.

47
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,591
And just as we were giving up,
do you remember what you said?

48
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,329
They're middle schoolers
just like we are...

49
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:54,265
There's no reason
we can't win this!

50
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,738
We still have
to try, okay?!

51
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:02,641
Wow, you just never
give up, do you?

52
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,509
I can't give
up now...

53
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,177
It's my last
tournament.

54
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:09,914
They're middle schoolers too,
huh? Yeah, good point!

55
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:13,017
And plus we just cleared
our first round one!

56
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:16,187
He's right! Let's win
our first round two!

57
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:17,956
Yeah!

58
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:21,726
[Ikejiri]:
Our spirits were high,

59
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:26,030
but obviously that wasn't enough
to make us suddenly improve.

60
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:34,405
I‐I'm sorry...

61
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:39,644
No. We're gonna take
the next point!

62
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:50,855
We lost that game,
but we were expecting it...

63
00:04:50,955 --> 00:04:54,593
so it didn't really
get us down that much.

64
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:57,495
Actually, we were kind of
relieved, because it meant

65
00:04:57,596 --> 00:05:01,465
we wouldn't have to do any more
intense training the next day.

66
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:08,406
But you... You were the
only one who was upset by it...

67
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:12,276
I didn't understand why, but
part of me was a little jealous

68
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:14,913
that you could
feel that way.

69
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:24,623
[Team Karasuno]:
Yes!

70
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:28,560
Um... are you okay?

71
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,328
[Daichi]:
Do it, Hinata!

72
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:31,395
It's all yours.

73
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,932
Hey, very nice
receive, Tamagawa!

74
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:35,634
Come to the left, here!

75
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:37,669
Here, Ikejiri!

76
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:44,275
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

77
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:51,683
So much for the
"wingless crows."

78
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:54,252
That's not what I was
expecting at all.

79
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:56,955
They're on
a different level!

80
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:04,629
Whenever there's
a net between you,

81
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,066
it doesn't matter what
anybody's ranking is anymore.

82
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,336
We can't win
unless... we try.

83
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:21,045
Well, I just mean... It's like
my friend used to say...

84
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,514
(whistle)

85
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:23,548
[Komaki]:
Time to go.

86
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,349
[Tamagawa]:
Yeah.

87
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,687
Jeez, I should've known it
wouldn't be as persuasive

88
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:32,557
[Ikejiri]:
coming from me.
I totally blew it...

89
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:34,358
Man...

90
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:36,327
(starting whistle)

91
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:38,262
[Daichi]:
Kageyama's up!

92
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:43,735
He got an ace!

93
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:45,837
Looks like Karasuno's starting
to get in the groove

94
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,339
after winning that
first set, huh?

95
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,418
[Team Karasuno]:
Got it!

96
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,221
Damn...

97
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:09,661
That's high!

98
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:25,710
We did i‐

99
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,812
Yeahhhhh!

100
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:30,715
Come on. It's one point.
Is it really that big a deal?

101
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,017
Of course it is! This
is the kind of play

102
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:34,619
that could change
everything!

103
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:35,419
Maybe you're right.

104
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,321
You guys...

105
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:39,858
Can't win unless
we try... you know?

106
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,325
And we're
not giving up!

107
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:44,095
Even small‐time teams know
they need to stick to it.

108
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,164
[Komaki]:
Let's win
this!

109
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:47,799
Yeah!

110
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:52,170
Look out!

111
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:54,739
Get it, Yui!

112
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,774
Right!

113
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,342
Let it go!

114
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:07,251
[Team Shirato]:
L, U, C, K, Y!
L, U, C, K, Y, lucky!

115
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,859
[Daichi]:
Even if you're not confident
that you can win...

116
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,329
and even if everyone around you
says that it's impossible...

117
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,498
no matter what...

118
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:29,307
"We can't allow
ourselves to say 'never!'"

119
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:30,742
[Shirato Girl 1]:
Heads up!

120
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:31,810
[Team Shirato]:
Let's go!

121
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,311
[Yui]:
Get it!

122
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,081
[Team Shirato]:
We did it! (cheering)

123
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:39,584
Don't let it
get to you.

124
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:42,453
It's my fault we
missed that, Yui.

125
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:45,089
Sorry! I just...

126
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:47,458
can't stop
messing us up!

127
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:52,496
Now's not the
time for that stuff.

128
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:56,701
On your feet... It's not over!

129
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:00,071
(whistle)

130
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:02,140
[Team Karasuno]:
Alright!

131
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:07,378
Match point, and it's
in their favor...

132
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:11,382
It won't hurt Karasuno at all
if they lose the next point.

133
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:14,953
But for us...

134
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:16,521
One more point.

135
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:17,789
This isn't over!

136
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,393
[Team Tokonami]:
Bring it, Karasuno!

137
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:26,531
Sakurai!

138
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:28,533
Ikejiri!

139
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:35,840
We haven't lost yet!

140
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,145
This is not the end!

141
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:42,547
Here!

142
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,034
YEAH!

143
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,303
DAMN YOU!

144
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:09,340
Next time... you're all mine!

145
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,810
[Daichi]:
Right! Take it back!

146
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,411
[Team Karasuno]:
Yeah!

147
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,282
Whoa, they're taking
this seriously.

148
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:23,487
[Ikejiri]:
No one else in this whole
gymnasium is concerned with us

149
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,524
or sees us as a threat.

150
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,595
[Ikejiri]:
The only team playing
us for keeps...

151
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,599
...is them.

152
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:00,258
Get your head out of
the clouds, dumbass!

153
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:01,059
It's time to‐

154
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,727
We won.

155
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,028
Uh‐huh...

156
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:06,798
So... That means
we get to play again.

157
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,970
Yeah... that's
how it works.

158
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:13,905
We won.

159
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,641
We won...

160
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,044
We won!

161
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:24,382
[Shoyo]:
That means we can play
some more volleyball!

162
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:28,352
We get to stay in the court
for a little while longer!

163
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:31,489
[Takeda]:
That little guy's been
dying to play a real game...

164
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,793
and now he's finally getting
his first taste of victory.

165
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:36,628
Yeah.

166
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,630
[Yutaro]:
What're they thinking?

167
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,932
Don't these amateurs know
they have another game to play

168
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,433
this afternoon?

169
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:45,637
Hm? Well... They were gonna
win that game either way...

170
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:48,172
They should've saved up
their energy for the next one‐

171
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,174
I disagree.

172
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:51,643
They gave
it their all...

173
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:55,479
But we didn't see that
special quick attack, did we?

174
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,783
The other game's done too...
And Date Tech dominated.

175
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:01,586
[Yutaro]:
Ahhh... Karasuno
versus Date Tech.

176
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:04,122
Now that's
more interesting.

177
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:08,059
We should go... If we miss our
next game, it won't matter.

178
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:20,304
[Yui]:
Aw, don't cry!
It's fine!

179
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:23,642
I'm sorry... they went
after all my serves.

180
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,811
I gave them so
many points...

181
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:32,350
The point is to keep
the ball in play...

182
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,587
They were just better at
that than us... so we lost.

183
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,922
It's not anyone's fault!

184
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,660
Captain... The
teacher needs you.

185
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,563
Okay... I'll
be right back.

186
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:53,071
Michimiya's really...
strong.

187
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,739
She practiced the hardest...

188
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,141
But she doesn't
seem all that upset.

189
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,977
She is.

190
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:02,180
[Mao]:
It's true. She just puts
on a brave face whenever

191
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,414
she's in
front of us.

192
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,083
It's almost time
for the next game.

193
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:08,152
[Mao]:
But I'm sure, as soon as
she has a moment to herself,

194
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:10,054
it'll all
hit her.

195
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:34,078
I didn't do too bad, really...
I didn't miss many practices.

196
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:38,617
After I saw the game on TV,
I said I'd be playing

197
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,985
to represent Japan one day.

198
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:44,222
Even though I said it jokingly,
part of me was serious.

199
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:47,191
But once I got into all
that resistance training,

200
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,628
my enthusiasm
fizzled out.

201
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:56,801
Is this it? It's only June...
How could it end so quickly?

202
00:13:56,901 --> 00:14:00,138
If only... I'd worked
just a little harder

203
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,340
to improve while
I had the chance.

204
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,211
If only I'd pushed myself
more during practice.

205
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,981
If only I'd been
a better captain...

206
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:13,652
If only I'd wanted badly enough
to make one more receive...

207
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:18,523
If only I'd made the time
to run one more step...

208
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,625
Maybe I would have
gotten to play volleyball

209
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:23,094
for just a little
while longer.

210
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,203
[Ikejiri]:
Sawamura!

211
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:36,207
Ikejiri?

212
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:50,088
Listen to me... Please keep
winning! For my team, too!

213
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:03,535
Sure. We'll
do our best!

214
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:11,910
[Ikejiri]:
To think, tens of thousands
of players around the country

215
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,713
are ending their seasons
early, just like we are.

216
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,116
To get to the Nationals, you
have to win every single game

217
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:19,951
in the
preliminaries.

218
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,087
If this was a TV drama...

219
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:26,658
the guys going to Nationals
would be the main characters,

220
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:29,861
and our team would be
extras or something.

221
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,163
But hey...

222
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,966
...we still got to play.

223
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:12,704
At least we
could still play...

224
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:15,974
[Ikejiri/Yui]:
Volleyball.

225
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,452
Karasuno was awesome.

226
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,655
Yeah, that short guy
really surprised me!

227
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:04,956
No kidding.

228
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,225
Did you see those
quick attacks he did?

229
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:13,932
Wh‐What?! Can't I just
be happy about this?!

230
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,735
Nobody's ever made a big deal
out of me like that before!

231
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,970
(seething)
(cowering)

232
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,172
I haven't said
a word, Hinata...

233
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:25,009
In fact, I'm glad to see
you getting some recognition.

234
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,679
The more the enemy teams
pay attention to you

235
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,814
and feel intimidated...
the greater the damage

236
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,850
you'll be able to do.

237
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,986
Uh... So I don't know
what that means...

238
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,756
but your face says
it's something evil.

239
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,160
That's right, Kageyama.

240
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,128
We're building
a great reputation

241
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:46,831
with everybody out there talking
about our little, red 10...

242
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:49,868
So we need Hinata
to shine out there.

243
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,003
[Keishin]:
So bright, the other team's
blockers are gonna be

244
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:55,507
too blinded to
know what's goin' on.

245
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,810
Just so you know, we'll be
using the same starting lineup

246
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,145
for round two as
we did for round one.

247
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,319
The next game will
be starting at 1:30...

248
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:09,688
Let's stay
loose you guys.

249
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,990
Now go get yourselves
a light lunch.

250
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,592
[Keishin]:
Don't fill up though.

251
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,695
[Team Karasuno]:
Yes, sir!

252
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,331
[Shoyo]:
Next is that "Iron Wall" school
with "No Brows," right?

253
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:21,465
[Tobio]:
Date Tech.

254
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:24,235
Yeah yeah,
that's the one.

255
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:28,206
Listen... I think the game back
in March where Date Tech beat us

256
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,709
[Tobio]:
was the reason
Asahi quit the club.

257
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,045
Ah! Really? You think
that was it?

258
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:37,248
In one of our games... every
single one of Asahi's spikes

259
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:39,283
was completely
shut down.

260
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:44,756
They've got blockers...
and they can stop Asahi.

261
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,358
Sorry to interrupt.

262
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,360
You guys got a minute?

263
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,431
[Daichi]:
Asahi.

264
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:56,467
We should go.

265
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:03,274
[Koshi]:
Listen to me, you guys. There's
something I want to address.

266
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:05,744
Date Tech is a very
tough opponent...

267
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,612
I'm sure you know
three months ago,

268
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:11,816
that iron wall block of theirs
completely obliterated us.

269
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,786
[Koshi]:
But now we have
our special decoy!

270
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:21,225
You have blazed a trail
so Hinata could succeed.

271
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:26,230
[Koshi]:
So... Please blaze
a trail for Asahi too!

272
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,344
Okay! Time to win round two!

273
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:43,181
Ooooh.. wuh?

274
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,724
Go, go, Date Tech,
Date Tech, here we go!

275
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:56,060
Go, go, Date Tech,
Date Tech, here we go!

276
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,798
Go, go, Date Tech,
Date Tech, here we go!

277
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,767
Date Teeeeech... let's fight!

278
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,102
Yeah!

279
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:07,405
[Moniwa]:
Run some laps!

280
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,841
Well, they've got the scare
tactics down, don't they?

281
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,510
Date Tech really
scares me...

282
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,145
That'd be like sharing the court
with a bunch of monsters.

283
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:17,015
Seriously, man! Did you see
that team they played against

284
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,251
in round one? Dude, I felt
really bad for their spiker.

285
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,355
[Spectator 1]:
Yeah, no matter what they did,
Date Tech shut 'em right down.

286
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:26,457
Captains!

287
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,127
Thank you for the game.

288
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:34,065
[Takeda]:
Oh boy... I get the
feeling this entire gym

289
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,200
wants Date Tech to win.

290
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,637
[Daichi]:
Looks like we're on
the receiving side...

291
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,571
You ready, sir?

292
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,905
Yep.

293
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:42,306
[Daichi]:
Receiving drills! Let's go!

294
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:43,107
Sir!

295
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,209
Alright!
Let's do this!

296
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:46,611
Right!

297
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:49,848
It's been three months
since Date Tech destroyed us.

298
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:53,552
Our team's definitely
been getting better...

299
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,555
but I think the third‐years
might still have the last defeat

300
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,389
stuck in their minds.

301
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:01,225
And we can't let that linger.
Best course of action right now

302
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:04,428
is to stop 'em from
obsessing over Date Tech.

303
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,366
Rollinggggg...

304
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,603
Thundeeeeeer!

305
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,137
Again!

306
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:22,747
(chuckles)
There ya go.

307
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:24,415
Nice! Killer
receive, Noya!

308
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,752
I mean, that was perfect!
Except for the name...

309
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:29,821
You wanna say that
to me again, baldy?!

310
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,356
Ooh, teach me!
Teach me the Again too!

311
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:34,626
[Tobio]:
How was that different
than the last one?

312
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:35,927
[Koshi]:
At least he got it.

313
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:37,629
[Daichi]:
You never quit, do you?

314
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,999
[Asahi]:
Tone it down, dude;
Daichi might get mad again.

315
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,433
Alright listen here!

316
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:45,770
You guys have nothing to
be afraid of at all!

317
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,439
[Yu]:
Focus on what's in front of you!

318
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,510
I promise I'll
always have your back.

319
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,649
Whoa... HE'S AMAZING!

320
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,521
Pretty cool.

321
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:08,627
That's great! Everybody's acting
like their usual selves again!

322
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,161
Yeah.

323
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:12,731
He may be short,
and his hair, ridiculous...

324
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,032
but he's reliable.

325
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,400
The libero's not
just there for defense...

326
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,870
Another big part of his job
is to support the team

327
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,905
from behind
the scenes.

328
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:24,042
We've got ourselves
a hell of a libero.

329
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:28,079
[Captains]:
Line up!

330
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,020
Thank you for the game!

331
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,282
[Tobio]:
So, No‐Brows got in your
way once before, Asahi?

332
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:12,617
[Asahi]:
Uh, yeah...

333
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,318
[Shoyo]:
Shouldn't HE be
scared of YOU?

334
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:16,721
[Tobio]:
Yeah, you look so
much older than he does.

335
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:17,889
[Asahi]:
Oh, come on!

336
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,123
[Koshi]:
Great job, guys...

337
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:22,160
Next Haikyu!! "The Iron Wall."

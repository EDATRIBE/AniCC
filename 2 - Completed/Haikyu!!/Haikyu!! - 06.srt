1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,600
[SHOYO]
I am SO sorry, Tanaka!
I mean it.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,438
[RYUNOSUKE]
I told you, it's okay... I'm
worried about YOU; do you feel
any better yet?

3
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:15,175
[SHOYO] Yeah... I do now that
I'm off the bus and I've rested
a little bit.

4
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:16,844
Sweet, I'm glad to hear that!

5
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:20,013
After all, whether we
win or lose today totally
depends on you!

6
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:24,918
[SHOYO] HUH?! (panicking)
[RYUNOSUKE] And let me hit
everything unmarked like you got
to do in the 3‐on‐3, okay?

7
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:27,721
[KOSHI]
Tanaka! Don't pressure him!

8
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:29,356
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh? What? Can't hear you.

9
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:32,059
[SHOYO]
(stomach gurgling) I‐I'll do
the best I can, I swear!

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,128
[SHOYO]
Hurghhh, I'm going to the
bathroom! (groan)

11
00:00:35,228 --> 00:00:37,931
[RYUNOSUKE]
Comin' out both ends?!
You're workin' overtime!

12
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:42,536
[TOBIO]
Huh? He's getting sick again?
That is so pathetic! I'm gonna
teach him a lesson...

13
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:47,407
[KOSHI] (worried) Hey what
are you talking about?! You
know beating the little guy up
isn't gonna do any good!

14
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:49,042
[TOBIO]
Well, it's worth a try!

15
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:51,044
[KOSHI]
Hold him back, Tanaka! Help me!

16
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:51,979
[RYUNOSUKE] You got it!
[DAICHI] (worried)

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,081
[TOBIO] Let go of me!

18
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,377
(crows cawing)

19
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:33,446
[YAHABA]
Hey, we're playing Karasuno
today, right?

20
00:02:33,547 --> 00:02:35,082
Doesn't that one guy go there?

21
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:36,183
[YUTARO] Who?

22
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:37,551
[YAHABA]
The King of the Court...

23
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:39,787
Didn't you guys go to middle
school together?

24
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,221
Or something like that?

25
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:43,423
[YUTARO]
Right... Kageyama...

26
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:45,458
There's nothing special
about that guy.

27
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:48,829
[YUTARO]
He had the best technique out
of anybody on the team,

28
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:52,465
but the jerk couldn't act like
a team player to save his life.

29
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:54,502
[YUTARO]
Too full of himself.

30
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:58,471
Yeah... Well I'm wondering why
he went to Karasuno High...

31
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:01,141
I mean they haven't had a
great team in a long time.

32
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,812
All I know about them now is
that they've got some super
hot babe for a team manager.

33
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:06,747
They have a girl?!

34
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:08,916
[YAHABA] Yeah, she's got
this sexy vibe about her.
[DAICHI] Have you seen Tanaka?

35
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:10,150
[KIYOKO]
No.

36
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,484
[YAHABA]
And one of their team members

37
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:13,220
looks like a juvenile
delinquent...

38
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,488
The guy's even got
a shaved bald head.

39
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:17,791
And it seems like he's
pretty stupid too.

40
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,993
HMMM?

41
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:21,562
[YAHABA YUTARO]
(startled)

42
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,532
[YAHABA]
Um... hello...

43
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:26,834
[RYUNOSUKE]
Don't mock my team, bro.

44
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:28,602
(crow cawing)

45
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:31,705
We'll have your heads.

46
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:33,240
[YUTARO YAHABA]
(scared)

47
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,110
Heh. Come on, Tanaka, there's
no need to talk like that.

48
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,112
[KEI]
I mean look what you've done;

49
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,648
the hotshots from Aoba Johsai
High School

50
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:42,583
are practically
shaking in their shoes.

51
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:44,985
You idiots really think
we're afraid of you?!

52
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:46,687
[YAHABA, internal]
Who is this beanpole?

53
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:49,256
I didn't know they had
a player that tall.

54
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:51,525
Oh yeah, good thinkin'...

55
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,361
It'll hurt worse if we kick
your asses on the court instead.

56
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:58,365
[DAICHI] Hey! Knock it off!
I cannot take you anywhere!
[RYUNOSUKE KEI] (startled)

57
00:03:58,465 --> 00:03:59,767
[DAICHI]
Please excuse him!

58
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,434
[YAHABA] Uh, it's fine.
[RYUNOSUKE] (straining)

59
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,504
[DAICHI]
Don't make that face at me!

60
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,241
[YUTARO]
So how ya been? Your Majesty...

61
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:12,179
I bet you've already whipped
your new loyal subjects into
shape. Haven'tcha?

62
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,113
[RYUNOSUKE] (enraged laugh)

63
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:14,515
[DAICHI] (grab)

64
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:18,686
Uh‐huh.

65
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:20,688
(shocked)

66
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:23,090
[TOBIO]
(smacked) Ow!
What was that for?!

67
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,993
[YUTARO] Yep, that's the
King... Stuck up as ever.
[RYUNOSUKE] You're growing
up so fast!

68
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:27,895
[TOBIO] What?!

69
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:37,571
[GUYS] (revving up for the game)

70
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:41,809
[SHOYO]
Whoa... No way... This gym is
huge.. THEY'RE huge...

71
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,210
[DAICHI] All together!

72
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,013
[SHOYO] (surprised)
[ALL] Thank you for having us!

73
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:48,281
[AOBA JOHSAI]
Thank you!

74
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:50,618
Every single player on the
Seijoh team has

75
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:53,554
exceptional offensive
and defensive abilities
individually.

76
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:58,125
[DAICHI] Their guys are all
good enough to be the ace
no matter where they go.
[HAJIME] Serve up!

77
00:04:58,225 --> 00:04:59,660
[MIZOGUCHI]
That's good, keep working on it!

78
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,129
And they're also famous for
their power blocking guys.

79
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,565
I dunno what you two
are so scared of;

80
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:07,267
Hinata's gonna take those losers
by surprise and blow 'em away!

81
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:12,239
[SHOYO] (startled)
[RYUNOSUKE] Plus.. I know how
much you suck so I'll be there
to cover for you the whole time!

82
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:14,675
[SHOYO] (surprised)
[DAICHI KOSHI] (amazed)

83
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:17,545
Oh, but you're on your own
whenever you serve the ball,
remember?

84
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:19,246
Try not to screw up okie dokie!

85
00:05:19,346 --> 00:05:21,214
[KOSHI DAICHI SHOYO] (panicked)
[RYUNOSUKE] (laugh)

86
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:24,718
Aw I'm just kiddin'! Fumblin' a
serve isn't all that bad my man!

87
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,887
Just let it roll off your
back and keep slammin'‐

88
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:30,090
Hm? Hey hang on..
Where'd he go?

89
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,424
[TADASHI]
The bathroom, I think.

90
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:32,893
[RYUNOSUKE]
Not again!

91
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:36,564
(flushing)
[SHOYO] Ugh, I'm
in trouble... ggh!

92
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:40,333
[YAHABA]
Man, those Karasuno guys sure
are arrogant. Who do they think
they are?

93
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:43,303
[YUTARO] Ugh, yeah. Huh?
[SHOYO] (surprised)

94
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:47,641
[SHOYO, internal]
Hey... He was next to Kageyama
in that game last year.

95
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,511
I could never forget a guy whose
head looks like an onion.

96
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:54,147
Hey... take it you're one
of their first‐years.

97
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:55,382
What's it to you?

98
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,350
So... How is King Kageyama?

99
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,121
Has he learned any manners?
Or is he still the same
conceited jackass?

100
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:05,726
What are you, crazy?!
"Conceited" doesn't
even come close to it!

101
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:08,261
[SHOYO]
It's like I'm a small, sad
little peasant p

102
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:12,399
putting up with the daily
torture of living in the Land
Without Fun or Happiness!

103
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:16,704
[SHOYO]
Just 'cause he's KINDA good,
he thinks he's the boss of
everybody!

104
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:18,005
See what I mean?

105
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:20,273
(laugh) He hates that guy!

106
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:22,009
I mean, I'll be
the first to admit

107
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:24,177
he's good at receiving,
blocking, and serving...

108
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:26,046
Oh yeah.. Real good!

109
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:27,480
[BOTH]
And his sets are...

110
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:29,082
[SHOYO] great too...
[YUTARO] a pain in the
ass...

111
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:30,017
[BOTH] Huh?

112
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,084
Are you sure?

113
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:34,522
Uh‐huh.

114
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:39,126
Let me guess, you've never had
to hit one of Kageyama's crazy
sets in a real game, have you?

115
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:42,495
They're terrible! It's literally
impossible to hit one!

116
00:06:42,596 --> 00:06:43,697
[SHOYO]
That bad, huh?

117
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:45,999
[YUTARO]
He's a selfish dictator.

118
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:49,302
What's the point of him being a
setter if he can't put the ball
where anyone can hit it?

119
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:51,539
He doesn't belong in
that position.

120
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,474
[YUTARO]
To him, a "teammate" is
just a mindless slave

121
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:56,677
who does whatever he tells them.

122
00:06:56,777 --> 00:07:00,113
[YUTARO]
Anyone he can't use... goes
straight into the trash...

123
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,115
[SHOYO] (think)
[YUTARO] Buh‐bye!

124
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,483
[RYUNOSUKE]
(laughter)

125
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:04,918
[YAHABA YUTARO]
(startled)

126
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:07,287
You wanna know if he's changed
since middle school?

127
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:09,356
You just wait and
see, Onion‐top!

128
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:10,390
[YUTARO]
What'd you say?!

129
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,692
Isn't that right, shorty?

130
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,661
[BOTH]
Uh?

131
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:17,598
[SHOYO, internal]
Anyone he can't use
goes in the trash?

132
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:20,367
What happens if I screw
up in front of him?

133
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:22,269
I have had enough of you!

134
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:23,537
(screaming)

135
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:24,772
I'll get swapped out!

136
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:27,240
[SHOYO] (nauseous)
I'm gonna be sick!

137
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,776
(shocked)

138
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:31,311
Yeah, this is gonna
be a good game.

139
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:33,246
(warming up)

140
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:35,248
(sick)
[DAICHI] Hinata!

141
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:38,752
Don't let your jitters get the
best of you my man... Relax.

142
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:41,354
Yes sir, I'll relax
as hard as I can!

143
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:43,557
[DAICHI] Hey Kiyoko, do you
think you could give him
[KOSHI] Hey, it's time to
go get changed.

144
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:45,726
[DAICHI] a few words of
inspiration?
[SHOYO] O‐okay!

145
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:46,994
[KIYOKO] Hm?

146
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:49,930
[KIYOKO] Excuse me.
[SHOYO] Huh?

147
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:55,035
Do your best.

148
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,170
[SHOYO] (overheat)
[KIYOKO DAICHI] (startled)

149
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,041
[DAICHI, internal]
Well, I killed Hinata...
Sorry, guys.

150
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,110
(whistle)

151
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,148
[UMPIRE]
Let the practice game between
Karasuno High and Aoba Johsai
officially begin!

152
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:09,950
[PLAYERS]
Thank you!

153
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,553
Is that short guy supposed
to be their middle blocker?

154
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:14,254
That has to be a mistake right?

155
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:15,523
Is that really
Kageyama over there?

156
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:16,924
Why's he with these guys?

157
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:17,791
("I dunno" mumble)

158
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:18,859
(panicking)

159
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,493
C'mon, pull yourself
together, Hinata.

160
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:23,496
[SHOYO]
Yes sir! I'll get it
together right now!

161
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:25,265
[DAICHI]
Seriously...calm down!

162
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:27,935
Hey, Hinata! You know
the plan right?

163
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:31,071
[SHOYO] Huh?
[TOBIO] Do it exactly
like the 3‐on‐3, okay?

164
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,272
Yeah, I understand!

165
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:33,907
(startled) You
sure about that?

166
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:36,910
[HAJIME]
Do it, Matsukawa!

167
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,079
[DAICHI] I got it! Right here!
[SHOYO] (stumble)

168
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,783
You moron! What's with you?!
That obviously wasn't your ball!

169
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:43,551
I'm sorry!

170
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:44,818
Ennoshita, cover!

171
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:45,452
Tanaka!

172
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:46,687
On it!

173
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:49,189
(grunt)

174
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:50,190
Ah...

175
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,324
That's one point.

176
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:52,660
(growling)

177
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,127
[SHOYO] (trembling)
[DAICHI] It's okay Hinata,

178
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:55,262
just take a nice deep breath and

179
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:56,564
pay attention to
your surroundings.

180
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:58,265
I'm sorry!

181
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:01,401
[TOBIO, internal]
He's completely cracked
under the pressure.

182
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:02,135
(whistle)

183
00:09:02,235 --> 00:09:03,470
(falling)

184
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,038
[SHOYO] Oof!
[TOBIO] (surprised)

185
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:06,740
[DAICHI]
Hinataaa!

186
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,810
Please stop stressing
out, buddy.

187
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,979
(whistle)

188
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,114
[RYUNOSUKE]
Yeah! Thanks a lot pal!

189
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:15,348
It touched the net.

190
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,084
Karasuno's finally
on the scoreboard.

191
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:18,586
[SHOYO] (yanked, trembling)
[TOBIO] Come oooon!

192
00:09:18,686 --> 00:09:20,821
Quit being nervous
or I will kill you!

193
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:23,957
[YUTARO] Well... There's the
great leader I remember.
[SHOYO] That's not helping me
calm down!

194
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,826
[AKIRA] He hasn't
changed a bit.
[TOBIO] Why not?!

195
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:29,329
Alright! We're gonna take
all those points back!

196
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:31,364
Next one to serve‐ (shock)

197
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:34,735
(internal) Oh no...
Hinata's up to serve.

198
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:38,005
[TOBIO] Talk about bad timing!
(SHOYO nervous)

199
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:39,940
[DAICHI] Just breathe, Hinata!
[SHOYO, internal] If I flub this
serve,

200
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,343
(gulp) we automatically lose
a point and the set's over!

201
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:47,781
Dude, call me crazy, but I
think Hinata just stopped
breathing; is he okay?

202
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:50,050
How do you expect me
to know that, huh?

203
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,554
Anyone he can't use...
goes straight into the
trash... Buh‐bye!

204
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,990
[SHOYO, internal]
You can't mess this up. If you
do, you'll get benched!

205
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:02,796
Just calm down... Everything's
fine... Everything's juuust...
(whistle) (panic)

206
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:05,365
Gah... Crap, that was
a terrible hit!

207
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:08,001
Gah! Guah! Ach!

208
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:15,576
[SHOYO] (nervous trembling)
[TOBIO] (seething)

209
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:23,984
(seething intensifies)

210
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:46,339
(long whistle)

211
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:53,013
[RYUNOSUKE] Pffff...
Damn, Kageyama...
(KEI laughing)

212
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:56,550
[RYUNOSUKE] I sure hope you've
got a couple brain cells left
over after all that!
[KEI] That was perfect!

213
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,451
[KOSHI] Stop, you're only
making it worse!

214
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:01,288
[DAICHI]
Knock it off, you two!

215
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:03,857
[SHOYO, internal]
I'm so dead...

216
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:05,058
[KEI RYUNOSUKE]
(stifling laughs)

217
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:06,727
[DAICHI]
Ah... Hold on, Kageyama...

218
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:09,530
[SHOYO] (shrinking back)
D‐don't hurt me!

219
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,298
L‐let's talk about this!

220
00:11:11,398 --> 00:11:14,434
W‐wait a second! N‐no!

221
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:21,975
(panicked breaths)

222
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:23,777
(nervous)

223
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,482
(uncertain)

224
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,418
[TOBIO] Look.
(SHOYO yelps)

225
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,622
[TOBIO]
What could you possibly
be freaking out about?

226
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:38,158
How tall those guys are?
Your first practice game?

227
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:40,293
(nervous)

228
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:45,966
[TOBIO]
There can't be anything scarier
than hitting me in the head with
the ball...

229
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:49,803
...right?

230
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:53,240
No, that's my worst nightmare.

231
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,644
Well, in that case you've got
nothing left to be scared of
anymore...

232
00:11:56,744 --> 00:12:00,013
I mean, you've already
done the most terrifying
thing you can do.

233
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:06,053
[TOBIO]
Which means... Might as well get
over it and get your head in the
game, dumbass!

234
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:07,521
(startled)

235
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:09,557
So I'm not in
trouble then?!

236
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:11,058
No.. Who cares?

237
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:13,727
Gah! (internal) Well if
I can get away with that,

238
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:15,262
I guess I can get away
with anything!

239
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:19,132
Thanks for freaking
me out, Onionhead!
Hm?

240
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:22,770
[SHOYO, internal]
Still, we did just lose the
first set thanks to me.

241
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,539
Kageyama's not the only teammate
I should be worried about.

242
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,974
[RYUNOSUKE]
Sidebar, Hinata.

243
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:29,643
[SHOYO]
(startled) (nervous)

244
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,645
[RYUNOSUKE] Listen up.
[SHOYO] Yes?

245
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:35,816
Don't go thinkin' you have
to be as good as these more
experienced guys already...

246
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,217
That doesn't make any sense.

247
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:40,187
But I have to do things
right... Or else..

248
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:44,357
I'll get taken out. And I
want to play the whole game.

249
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:48,929
Look, kid... You're stupid if
you think that crap is gonna
change my mind!

250
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:50,831
I know good and well
what a klutz you are!

251
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:53,534
[SHOYO] (shocked)
[RYUNOSUKE] Daichi knows too
and he still let you play!

252
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:56,369
[DAICHI] Huh?
[RYUNOSUKE] Forget about being
swapped out!

253
00:12:56,469 --> 00:13:00,941
You can worry about
that when... uh...
(confused)

254
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,144
When you do get swapped
out, how about that?!
HUH?!

255
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:06,914
[RYUNOSUKE] You're not that
bright as it is, don't waste
[TAKEDA] Do you think we should
step in?

256
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:09,082
[RYUNOSUKE] brainpower on
stuff that hasn't happened yet!
[KOSHI] No, I think Tanaka can
handle it.

257
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:11,251
[RYUNOSUKE]
See, here's the cool
thing about volleyball.

258
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:15,422
Everybody you see on this
side of the net... is your
ally, okay?!

259
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:17,891
[SHOYO] (surprised)
[RYUNOSUKE] So it's fine
if you kinda suck.

260
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:23,296
Just do your thing, even if it
messes us up! We're here to back
you up, bro!
[TOBIO] (sigh)

261
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:26,166
We're a team! Us and you!

262
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,735
(excited)

263
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,603
Now, who's your favorite
upperclassman?!

264
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,371
It's you for sure!

265
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:33,641
[RYUNOSUKE] Haha, call
me Mr. Tanaka Sir!
[KOSHI] Tanaka really wants

266
00:13:33,741 --> 00:13:35,475
[KOSHI] to be treated like
an upperclassman.
[SHOYO] Mr. Tanaka Sir!

267
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:37,578
[RYUNOSUKE] If you say that,
[DAICHI] Yeah... well it's still

268
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:39,780
[RYUNOSUKE] I'll
help with anything!
[DAICHI] good to have
him on the team.

269
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,215
[SHOYO] Wow. Thanks
Mr. Tanaka Sir!
[DAICHI] Crap like
that always sound best

270
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:44,918
[RYUNOSUKE] (big laugh)
[DAICHI] coming from someone
who's honest to a fault...
like he is.

271
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:47,487
(whistle)
[GIRL A] What's up?

272
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:49,222
[GUY A]
Eh, just a practice game.

273
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:51,224
[GIRL B]
Looks like they're
starting the 2nd set.

274
00:13:51,324 --> 00:13:54,528
Dude, you gotta teach me how
to do that back‐of‐the‐head
serve later!

275
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:58,265
[SHOYO] (embarrassed)
[KEI] Yeah, it's great; could
you teach it to me too?

276
00:13:58,365 --> 00:13:59,800
(whistle)

277
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,535
[DAICHI]
You're up, Ennoshita!

278
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:03,003
(focused)

279
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:05,072
[TOBIO]
It's just like the 3‐on‐3.

280
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:07,608
First, go to a spot where they
don't have any blockers.

281
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,144
Then at your maximum speed, I
want you to jump and swing as
hard as you can...

282
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:14,615
Be careful not to bump into
our other spikers though, okay?

283
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:15,616
[SHOYO]
Yeah I Gotcha!

284
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,017
[YAHABA]
Kunimi!

285
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,720
[RYUNOSUKE]
You got cover?

286
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,754
[TOBIO]
Yeah!

287
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:22,255
Let's take it
to the left!

288
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:23,090
[DAICHI]
No, right!

289
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,491
They can't do quick attacks.

290
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:27,227
I'm sure they'll shoot for
an opening on the side.

291
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:29,897
Huh?

292
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,434
What in the hell?

293
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:38,539
[SHOYO]
Huh? I didn't touch it...

294
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,608
(whistle)

295
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,544
(internal) So they CAN
do quick attacks?

296
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:46,246
Maybe it's a bluff.
Either way...

297
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:50,651
If you keep missing those, it's
only a matter of time before the
King tears you a new one!

298
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:51,785
(startled)

299
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:52,786
[TOBIO]
Hinata!

300
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:53,721
(scared)

301
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:55,022
Here it comes.

302
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:56,356
Sorry 'bout that...

303
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:57,324
That last set...

304
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:58,425
it was a bit too high.

305
00:14:58,526 --> 00:14:59,960
(stunned)

306
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:02,129
He's sorry?

307
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:03,230
I guess so.

308
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,298
[SHOYO]
That's cool, I forgive you.

309
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:10,037
[TOBIO] (pissed)
[SHOYO] Owowowow! Stop giving
me the iron claw, Kageyama!

310
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:11,572
(confused)
(whistle)

311
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:13,774
[HAJIME]
Service!

312
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:15,342
[SHINJI] Nice serve!
[CHIKARA] Hey, comin' atcha!

313
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:16,910
[TOBIO]
Got it!

314
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:19,312
[YUTARO] They go the right
and center.

315
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:20,848
[RYUNOSUKE] Over here!
[YUTARO] Left side's waiting.

316
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:23,250
(internal) Who's the
King gonna pick?

317
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,085
Okay, here goes!

318
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:29,957
Huh?

319
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:31,458
[BOTH]
Woooo!!

320
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,492
[BOTH]
Yes!

321
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:33,493
Nice one!
Wow!

322
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:34,862
I see...

323
00:15:34,962 --> 00:15:37,464
It's that weird set‐and‐spike
routine again.

324
00:15:37,565 --> 00:15:38,766
[GUY B] Did you see that?!

325
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:40,000
[GUY C] He's fast!

326
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,368
Come over here, you two!

327
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:42,603
Uh?
Huh?

328
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:44,204
[DAICHI RYUNOSUKE]
Nice play!

329
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:45,939
[ALL]
Yeah!

330
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,176
Awesooome! That was
so team‐like!

331
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:53,614
Huh? What do you mean
"like"? We ARE a team.

332
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:57,651
(smile) Yeah,
you're totally right!

333
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,753
Nice one, first‐year.
Thank you!

334
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:01,889
[YAHABA] Quick‐attacks? Really?
[DAICHI] Give me one more of
those.

335
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:05,025
[TOBIO] Sure!
[YUTARO] He seems a lot
different since the first
set ended.

336
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:10,531
(internal) That's right, start
panicking. I want you to be
totally focused on Hinata.

337
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:15,402
[TOBIO]
Okay guys, Hinata's on track
now. Time for the counterattack.

338
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:16,904
[KEI SHOYO CHIKARA] (focus)
[RYUNOSUKE] Heh!

339
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:19,540
[RYUNOSUKE] A chance ball!
[SHOYO] I got it!

340
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,176
I know what to look out for now.
You're not foolin' me kid!

341
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:25,913
What did you say?!

342
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:29,049
You're mine now!

343
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:31,351
[RYUNOSUKE]
Eat this! You like that?!

344
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:33,320
[YUTARO, internal] Dammit,
the shorty was a decoy.
[RYUNOSUKE] Wooo! Got'em!

345
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,156
Aw man I thought he
was sending it to me!

346
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:37,858
[RYUNOSUKE] How do
you like me now?!
[YUTARO SHOYO] Huh?

347
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,327
Told you we'd show
your asses up!

348
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:41,194
(pissed)

349
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:43,396
Uwah... I acted all tough

350
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:45,766
and talked smack 'cause
I thought the ball was for me.

351
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:47,000
I feel dumb!

352
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,702
And there's nothing
wrong with that...

353
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,938
You were convinced you
were going to hit it..

354
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:53,641
so you convinced
all of them too.

355
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:54,808
Does that work?

356
00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:56,644
Apparently.

357
00:16:56,744 --> 00:16:57,678
Dammit.

358
00:16:57,778 --> 00:16:59,446
[HAJIME]
Relax, Kindaichi...

359
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:01,849
We're making all our
attacks count today;

360
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:03,383
there's no need to
let it get to you.

361
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:04,652
Right.

362
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:09,489
[GUY A] Whoa... Even to
the untrained eye, it's
pretty obvious
(whistle) (KURASUNO cheers)

363
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,425
[GUY A] that their blocks
are being scattered all over
the place.
[RYUNOSUKE] Slick move, Daichi!

364
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:15,629
[GIRL B]
Was Karasuno High ever
this good before now?

365
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:16,730
(face‐smacked) Bleh!

366
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,431
(concerned)
Pff! (giggling)

367
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:20,367
[TOBIO] Not again!
[GIRL B] They make a lot
of mistakes, though.

368
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,735
(grunt)

369
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,544
(short whistle, long whistle)

370
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:31,712
[HAJIME]
Over here!

371
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,380
[AOBA JOHSAI] Yessir!

372
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:38,686
Something wrong, Hinata?

373
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:41,922
No.. It's just that the first
time I played in a game,

374
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:44,592
I felt like it was up to me to
carry the whole thing by myself.

375
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,860
[KOSHI] Great!‐ Let's keep
this energy going
[TAKEDA] Great play guys!
[SHOYO] But now, I'm surrounded

376
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,428
[KOSHI] and win the second set!
[SHOYO] by a team full of
players who

377
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:50,363
[SHOYO] are a lot better
at the game than me.

378
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:51,932
[SHOYO] I can depend on them.
[RYUNOSUKE] Leave the next one
to me!

379
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:54,134
All I gotta do is
believe and jump!

380
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:57,638
I guess I never really had
to worry about much else, huh?

381
00:17:57,738 --> 00:17:59,873
[DAICHI] Huh...
[TOBIO] Hurry up.
[SHOYO] Don't throw towels
at me!

382
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:01,809
[DAICHI] He may not
realize it yet,
[SHOYO] Don't throw
towels at me!

383
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:04,044
[DAICHI] but that leap of faith
of his is one hell of a weapon.

384
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:05,946
[YAHABA]
Okay what's the deal?

385
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:09,049
That Kageyama guy isn't
anything like you said he was.

386
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:10,784
Yeah, well I've never seen him
like that either!

387
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:13,253
How was I supposed to know that
there would actually be a spiker

388
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:16,023
on this planet who could hit
those ridiculous royal sets?!

389
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,091
[IRIHATA] That's not quite it.
[YUTARO] (surprised)

390
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:22,563
From where I'm standing, their
number 5 player hasn't been
looking at the ball at all.

391
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:24,832
[YUTARO]
Wait what are you
talking about, Coach?

392
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:27,635
[IRIHATA]
The best I can figure out is
that Kageyama is purposefully

393
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:31,171
aiming the ball to match the
downward swing of the palm of
the spiker's hand.

394
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:33,173
[HAJIME]
Is that even possible?

395
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:37,244
So Kageyama... changed
his playing style?

396
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:41,414
[IRIHATA]
I'll tell you one thing ‐ that
number 5 of theirs must be
pretty darn talented

397
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:44,151
[IRIHATA] if he can get a
self‐centered and arrogant
player like Kageyama
[KEI] Hey, you want a drink?

398
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,987
[IRIHATA] to adjust his habits
like that.
[KEI] Your face is a little
lower down than I thought.

399
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:49,590
The really incredible part of it
is that Number 5

400
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,593
apparently trusts in Kageyama's
sets one hundred percent.

401
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:56,196
[IRIHATA]
He simply believes
the ball will come.

402
00:18:56,296 --> 00:19:00,000
[IRIHATA] If they shake off your
blocking, just receive and keep
the ball in the air!

403
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,971
You boys are our starting
lineup. Show 'em what
you're made of!

404
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,372
[ALL] Right!

405
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,174
(whistle)

406
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:09,577
[IRIHATA] (sigh)
[HAJIME] Let's turn
this game around!

407
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:11,612
[AOBA JOHSAI] Yeah!
[MIZOGUCHI] Kageyama's really
good...

408
00:19:11,712 --> 00:19:14,414
I kind of wish we
could've recruited him
back at Aoba‐Johsai...

409
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:16,850
Didn't you try to
get him here, sir?

410
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,388
Yeah... but even if he had come
to our school, despite all of
his technical ability,

411
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,891
would he have made plays like
that? I don't think so.

412
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:26,259
[MIZOGUCHI] Huh?
[TOBIO] Get ready!

413
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,796
[IRIHATA] I think it's Karasuno
‐ specifically Number 5
[TOBIO] I want us to take the
second set!

414
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:30,731
[IRIHATA] that made him into
the player we see now.
[SHOYO] Ow! Don't hit me so
hard!

415
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:32,099
[TOBIO] I'm encouraging you.

416
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,802
[DAICHI] Hey, time to start.
[MIZOGUCHI] Hm? Oh.

417
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:37,370
[DAICHI]
Chance ball!

418
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:39,573
[RYUNOSUKE]
Four‐eyes!

419
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:41,842
Aw yeah!

420
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:43,544
[TADASHI]
Good one, Tsukki!

421
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:44,878
Nice, Tsukishima!

422
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:47,715
Your sets are so precise, it
actually makes me nauseous.

423
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:51,685
[DAICHI] Tsukishima is being
kinda rude about it,
[TOBIO] What! Next time I'll aim
for your glasses, how's that?

424
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:54,321
[DAICHI] but I understand where
he's coming from...
[KEI] Go ahead... You'll just
get kicked out of the gym again.

425
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:57,190
[DAICHI] Anytime he wants the
ball to come his way,
[TOBIO] Then I won't let them
see me.

426
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,793
[DAICHI] it's already right
there in front of him.
[KEI] Do you think you can get
away with that? Come on.

427
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:01,762
[DAICHI] It's a little scary...
but...it works.

428
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:03,496
We're in the middle
of a game guys.

429
00:20:03,597 --> 00:20:05,599
Can we maybe save
this for later?

430
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:06,634
Your serve, Tanaka!

431
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:07,801
[TADASHI HISASHI KAZUHITO]
You got this!

432
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:09,803
Ah, I get it now.

433
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:13,440
[TAKEDA]
The team rotates every time they
earn a point and get serving
rights...

434
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:19,680
[TAKEDA] Which means Kageyama,
Tsukishima, and Ennoshita should
all be playing forward now.
[CROWD] (cheers)

435
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,084
[KOSHI] Right. So at this point,
their positions are the opposite
of what they were when the game
started.

436
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:27,588
Thanks to Hinata's decoy
tactics, the overall success
rate of our attacks

437
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:34,261
increases whenever we have
him in the front row...
Also, whenever the ball
goes to Tsukishima...

438
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:37,030
(smile)
(impressed)

439
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,433
[TAKEDA]
His blocks are every bit as
intimidating as Seijoh's are!

440
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:46,139
I'm sorry, is blocking your
specialty too? Just try and
stay out of my way, would ya?

441
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:50,243
Watch your mouth... Get too
close and your skinny ass'll
get blown away.

442
00:20:50,343 --> 00:20:53,446
[KEI TOBIO] (angry)
[CHIKARA] Uh.. Let's not
fight, okay guys? (worried)

443
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:56,016
You're s'posed to fight
the guys in blue! Blue!

444
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:58,652
[TOBIO KEI] (growling) (focus)
[RYUNOSUKE] Here comes the ball!

445
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,059
What are you so proud of?
I was the one who blocked
it, you know.

446
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,928
Oh whatever, it
hit my hand too!

447
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:10,497
[DAICHI] Knock it off!
Cut that crap out!
[KEI TOBIO] (startled)

448
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:12,933
(internal) Heh, for once it's
not me getting yelled at‐
(shaken)

449
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:15,736
[TOBIO]
Wipe that grin off your
stupid face or I will
wipe it off for you!

450
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:17,337
What did I just tell you?!

451
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:22,643
(whistle)
[HAJIME] Crap...
This is too close.

452
00:21:22,743 --> 00:21:25,546
[MIZOGUCHI]
Get it together, Kunimi, that
won't happen if you cover!

453
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:27,915
[MIZOGUCHI] I was right,
that Number 5 of theirs
[AOBA A] Shake it off, guys!
Go for the next one!

454
00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:29,917
[MIZOGUCHI] is unstoppable, huh?
[AOBA B] Let's get ready.
We can do this!

455
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:33,787
I agree... Combining him
with Kageyama is even more
intimidating...

456
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:35,689
but it's not just them.

457
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:40,894
[IRIHATA]
What Tanaka lacks in
composure he makes up
for in power and guts.

458
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:45,833
[IRIHATA]
Tsukishima's a smart blocker,
even if he's not too ambitious.

459
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:49,903
[IRIHATA]
Their captain Sawamura neatly
covers the team's weak areas.

460
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:54,908
[SHOYO] Over here!
[IRIHATA] Some of the team
members are amateurs, and their
defense is full of holes...

461
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:59,813
[IRIHATA]
...but the offense is flexible
enough to make use of their
greener players.

462
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:03,016
[IRIHATA]
They really took us by surprise.

463
00:22:04,652 --> 00:22:08,522
[IRIHATA]
So this is Karasuno.
A wild... disjointed...

464
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:09,289
(whistle)

465
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:11,458
[ALL] Yeah!
[TOBIO] Oo!

466
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,860
[IRIHATA] ... interesting team.

467
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,295
(long whistle)
[GUY A] Whoa!

468
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:17,097
[GIRL B]
I can't believe
they won the set!

469
00:22:17,197 --> 00:22:18,766
Damn.

470
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:20,934
[RYUNOSUKE] Hell yeah!
[CHIKARA] Lookin' good out
there, Kageyama.

471
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:21,969
[TOBIO] Oh, thanks.

472
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:23,303
Time to take the final set..

473
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:24,838
[RYUNOSUKE] right?
[SHOYO] (splutter, coughing)

474
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:27,107
None of the guys on their team
can serve like Kageyama...

475
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:28,942
[CHIKARA] It's an advantage.
[RYUNOSUKE] This is our
comeback!

476
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,344
[SHOYO] Yeah!
[DAICHI] Totally... It's
been huge for us...

477
00:22:31,444 --> 00:22:33,814
[DAICHI] Because our receiving
could use some work...
[SHOYO RYUNOSUKE, chanting]
Comeback!

478
00:22:33,914 --> 00:22:35,282
[DAICHI]
Thank you.

479
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:37,885
[TOBIO] Don't get comfortable.
[DAICHI CHIKARA] Huh?

480
00:22:37,985 --> 00:22:39,953
That setter of theirs...

481
00:22:40,053 --> 00:22:42,355
I don't think he's..
their starter...
(GIRLS cheering and squealing)

482
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:43,757
[ALL]
Huh?

483
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:44,892
(gasp)

484
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,295
[IRIHATA]
Hey... Oikawa's back.
'Bout time.

485
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:25,258
[SHOYO]
So that's not Seijoh's
official setter?!

486
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:29,262
[RYUNOSUKE]
Who cares? I wanna know why this
joker walked in lookin' so smug.

487
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:30,798
[RYUNOSUKE]
Kageyama, what do you know?!

488
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:32,966
[TOBIO]
Well, you'll just have to find
out next time.

489
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:34,334
[SHOYO RYUNOSUKE]
What?

490
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:37,470
[TOBIO] Next Haikyu!! "Versus
The Great King."

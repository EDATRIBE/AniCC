1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:03,570
(long whistle)
(CROWD cheers)

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:12,345
[SHOYO]
My first and last real game
in middle school... we got
our butts kicked.

3
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:18,685
[SHOYO]
We lost to the King of the
Court, and I swore I'd challenge
him to a revenge match.

4
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:22,789
[SHOYO]
After all that happened,
I enrolled at Karasuno
High School.

5
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:25,626
[SHOYO, internal]
But now... (stunned)

6
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,196
[SHOYO]
No... wait...

7
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,768
[SHOYO, internal]
Why? What is this guy
doing at Karasuno?

8
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,938
[SHOYO, internal]
No... it's gotta
be somebody else.

9
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:22,275
Why did you come to this
tournament anyway? Not giving up
is a lot easier said than done!

10
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,244
I'm gonna be the one in
the winner's court!

11
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,680
What did you waste your time
on for three years, huh?!

12
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,718
[SHOYO, internal]
Nope, it's him; that jerk really
is here! Tobio Kageyama.

13
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,921
We met last year.
I forgot your name.

14
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,058
(stunned) Uh! M‐my name's
Shoyo Hinata, okay?!

15
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,895
But I'm sure you don't even
remember who I am. I mean,
you destroyed us in one game!

16
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,797
I remember exactly
who you are.

17
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,198
[SHOYO]
Huh?

18
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,167
[TOBIO, internal]
He's got amazing reflexes,

19
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,335
[TOBIO, internal]
he can jump high, and he's fast.

20
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,805
[TOBIO, internal]
But he doesn't use those
abilities to their full
potential.

21
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,674
[SHOYO]
Ugh, what's with the
silent treatment?!

22
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,242
[SHOYO]
What, you wanna fight
or something?!

23
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,711
Oh, don't be a dumbass!

24
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,081
[SHOYO]
(shocked) Er...
Don't make fun of me!

25
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:06,219
I might've lost really bad
the first time we met...
But never again!

26
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,591
[SHOYO]
(taken aback) Look! I came here
to get my revenge

27
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,193
and now I find out you're gonna
be on the same team as me?!

28
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,095
How am I s'posed to kick
your butt that way?!

29
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,297
[SHOYO]
There's tons of better schools
you could have gone to!

30
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,899
Why'd you have to pick this one?

31
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,801
Why didn't you go to
one of those instead?
[TOBIO] (annoyed)

32
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,804
[TOBIO]
I applied to the school
with the best team...

33
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,772
[SHOYO] (gulp)
[TOBIO] But...

34
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,941
Didn't make it

35
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,876
Huh? You didn't?

36
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,412
[SHOYO]
They rejected the
King of the Court?

37
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:36,683
[TOBIO, angry]
Never call me that... ever!

38
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,418
(confused)

39
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,255
[DAICHI]
Who knew the setter from
Kitagawa First would end
up at our school?

40
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,958
[RYUNOSUKE]
He better not be too cocky.
Or I'll have to pound him one.

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,761
[KOSHI]
Give it a rest, Tanaka...
You don't have to threaten
everybody.

42
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,732
[RYUNOSUKE]
What are you gonna do
about it, huh? Yeah,
that's what I thought.

43
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,567
Uh... Hello.

44
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:02,375
[RYUNOSUKE]
(menacing) Well, well, well...
Now what do we have here‐

45
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,977
[DAICHI]
You Kageyama?

46
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,078
[TOBIO]
Yeah.

47
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,212
[DAICHI]
It's nice to meet you.

48
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,514
[KOSHI]
Pretty tall,
aren'tcha?

49
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,315
First impressions are
everything, Suga!

50
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,252
You're a third‐year, so you
have to establish dominance!
(threatening)

51
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,688
[DAICHI]
Stop it, Tanaka...
You look stupid.

52
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,524
[SHOYO, internal]
Huh? Kageyama's a little
taller than them...

53
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,894
but wow, these high schoolers
are all pretty huge!

54
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:25,231
[SHOYO, internal]
I can't believe I'm really here!
This'll be great!

55
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,800
[SHOYO] Hey guys!
[DAICHI] So how tall are you?

56
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,569
[SHOYO] Uh.. hey dudes?
[TOBIO] Six feet.
[KOSHI] Whoa.

57
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,370
[RYUNOSUKE] Six feet?
That's badass.
[SHOYO] Excuse me?

58
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,038
[SHOYO]
Hey!

59
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,276
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh? Hey.. it's you!

60
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,944
[SHOYO] (startled)
[RYUNOSUKE] You're the shorty!

61
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,246
[KOSHI] (amazed)
[DAICHI] (surprised)
Wait a minute...

62
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:45,018
So the other applicant goes
by the name of Shoyo Hinata...
I guess that's you?

63
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,454
[SHOYO] Uhhh...
[DAICHI] It's just... kind of
surprising, that's all...

64
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:53,627
But hey! You guys
both chose Kurasuno!

65
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:54,561
Guess so...

66
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,896
Didn't mean to freak you out;

67
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,964
it's just you made a big
impression last year.

68
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,267
Yeah, you were tiny and all
over the place, but you
really had some spunk!

69
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,703
[SHOYO]
Wow, thanks a lot!

70
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,805
Not to mention
that jump of yours.

71
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,508
[RYUNOSUKE]
It's too bad you haven't hit
a growth spurt yet though.

72
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,510
[SHOYO]
(taken aback) (grunt)

73
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,345
I know! I may be small,
but I've got talent!

74
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,616
[SHOYO] I'll be Karasuno's
ace before you know it!
[TOBIO] (surprised) (annoyed)

75
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:22,188
[RYUNOSUKE] Hot damn! Already
got your eyeballs on the ace
position, do ya? Somebody's got
cajones.

76
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,425
[KOSHI]
Well, there's nothing wrong
with shooting for the stars,
is there? Right?

77
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,961
[SHOYO] (hopeful)
Yeah! I'll do my best!

78
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,497
Okay then... Now that you've
sworn to become the ace...

79
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,034
you'd better be prepared
to back it up.
[SHOYO] (surprised)

80
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:37,738
[TOBIO]
If you're not careful, you'll
waste another three years.

81
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,073
Excuse me?

82
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:46,012
[DAICHI]
(sigh) Was that really
necessary, Kageyama?

83
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,914
I did everything I could!

84
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,850
[SHOYO]
I did!

85
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,257
[SHOYO]
(determined) Look... I've done
a lot! Stop putting me down!

86
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,561
[SHOYO] (snarl)

87
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,897
Relax, guys... You know you're
not enemies anymore, right?

88
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,699
Volleyball supposed to
bring people together‐

89
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,467
[SHOYO]
I want you to play
me right now!

90
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,735
[RYUNOSUKE]
Whoa, watch it, punk;

91
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,036
don't you know Daichi's
talking to you?!

92
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,304
What are we
gonna play?

93
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,906
Volleyball, what the
heck else is there?!

94
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,742
[TOBIO]
How do you plan to play
volleyball one‐on‐one?

95
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,343
[SHOYO]
Like, passes and stuff!

96
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,812
[TOBIO]
How does anybody win at that?

97
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,981
[SHOYO] (seethe)
[RYUNOSUKE] The kid's
got a point!

98
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,348
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
What's all the noise in here?

99
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,717
[DAICHI]
Huh?

100
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:26,920
Oh turds, VP...

101
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,289
Be quiet!
Why don't you be quiet!

102
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,157
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
Are you boys fighting in here?

103
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,394
[DAICHI]
No, we're just working hard as
always, Vice Principal, right?

104
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:38,565
We gotta watch ourselves
around the Vice Principal;
that guy's always waiting
for us to slip up!

105
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:42,669
[SHOYO] Serve it to me!... I can
handle whatever you send!
[RYUNOSUKE] Dude!

106
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,573
Listen, jerk... I only received
one serve from you last year...

107
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,742
[SHOYO, internal]
Granted it was with my face.

108
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:53,046
[SHOYO, internal]
But since then I've practiced
with everyone I could!

109
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,582
I am not the same
person I was!

110
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:59,686
[TOBIO]
Hmph. Not the same person, huh?

111
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,560
Well, I've improved a bit
in the last year too.

112
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,763
Alright, alright... That's
enough smack‐talk, you guys.

113
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,732
They're both
first‐years,
aren't they?

114
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,534
[SHOYO, internal]
Don't let him get to you.

115
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:17,671
Remember everything you
learned from practicing
with the ladies' team!

116
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,641
[TOBIO]
Get ready.

117
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,510
[SHOYO, internal]
A jump serve?! That's new.

118
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,913
(gasp) (knocked down)

119
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,952
[KOSHI] (amazed)
[RYUNOSUKE] Whoa... Not
even I could catch that!

120
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,822
[SHOYO, internal]
Whoa I never saw a serve like
that from any of the ladies I
played with...

121
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,692
[TOBIO]
Pathetic. How's that
different than last year?

122
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,194
[SHOYO]
(surprised) Tch!

123
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,697
One more try.

124
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,198
Okay... Now cut it out.

125
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,902
I see the new recruits have no
respect for their captain.

126
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,508
[TOBIO] (surprised)
[KOSHI] (shocked)
[KOSHI, internal] Nice reflexes!

127
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,377
[KOSHI] He got right behind it,
now he can control it.
[SHOYO] (smacked)

128
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,745
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
If this keeps‐ (smacked)

129
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,614
[DAICHI] (shocked)
[VICE PRINCIPAL] (pained)

130
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,048
[KOSHI] Or not...

131
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,984
(panicked)

132
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,157
[TOBIO]
Oh man, that was a toupee?

133
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,528
[SHOYO]
You just now figured that out?
I noticed it at the entrance
ceremony.

134
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:18,464
[DAICHI] (growling)
[RYUNOSUKE] Dude!.. Shut up!
(crack up) It's not even that
funny! (laughter)

135
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,400
[KOSHI] You shut up, moron!

136
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,504
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
Captain... a word please?

137
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:31,111
[DAICHI]
Luckily, we're not in trouble.
He doesn't even want an apology.
(relieved sigh)

138
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,479
[DAICHI]
But we have been
sworn to secrecy.

139
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,916
(surprised)
[SHOYO TOBIO] (glare)

140
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,151
[DAICHI]
As for you two‐ (annoyed)

141
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,521
[TOBIO]
If you'd handled the serve, it
wouldn't have happened in the
first place!

142
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:43,156
You're the same klutz you were
last year. I can't believe I
thought you'd be a challenge.

143
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,191
[SHOYO]
You don't know when
to quit, do you?

144
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,629
[DAICHI] Can it! There's
something I want to tell you.
(ALL surprised)

145
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:52,365
[DAICHI]
I don't know what your reasons
were for choosing to come to
this high school...

146
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,503
but... I assume you came to win.
[SHOYO] Yeah!
[TOBIO] Yes, Obviously.

147
00:08:56,603 --> 00:09:01,508
[DAICHI]
Up until a few years ago,
Karasuno's volleyball team could
compete with the best of them...

148
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,044
They even made it
to nationals once.

149
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:12,919
But these days we're 8th in
the prefecture. Not terrible,
but not good either. And people
talk. They call us...

150
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,155
[DAICHI]
The wingless crows.

151
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:20,160
[DAICHI]
I remember when Karasuno played
in the Spring High national
tournament...

152
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,197
I was a student at a nearby
school who just happened to
be in the neighborhood.

153
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:29,736
Watching them fight those
tough opponents in that
huge gym in Tokyo...

154
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,437
[DAICHI]
It gave me chills.

155
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,606
[SHOYO] (OM gasp)

156
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,274
(cheers on TV)

157
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,312
Let's go back..
one more time!

158
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,587
(cheers)
[SHOYO] (surprised)

159
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,890
(cheers surge)

160
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,860
[SHOYO]
We're going to play on the same
court the Tiny Giant played!

161
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,399
[TOBIO]
The nationals, huh? Plenty of
high schools talk about making
it there one day...

162
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,701
Doesn't mean they'll go.

163
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,168
Wha‐?! You little...

164
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,938
[DAICHI]
I know what you mean.
But I'm dead serious.

165
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:09,375
[TOBIO] (straighten up)
[DAICHI] If we want to
get there, we need to be
a cohesive unit.

166
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,378
[DAICHI]
That means no more run‐ins
with the VP, for one thing.

167
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:17,784
[RYUNOSUKE KOSHI](uncomfortable)
[DAICHI] It's not like I'm
telling you to be best friends
or anything like that.

168
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:21,822
[RYUNOSUKE] (uneasy)
[DAICHI] I know back in middle
school you two might have been
adversaries

169
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:29,530
on opposite sides of the net...
but let me be clear... You're on
one side now and you need to
make peace with that.

170
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,565
Is that clear?

171
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,066
[SHOYO TOBIO] (shocked)

172
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,468
[DAICHI] I don't care
how good you are.
[TOBIO] (gasp)

173
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,739
[DAICHI] Or how determined
you are to play hard.
[SHOYO] (gasp)

174
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,977
[DAICHI] Anyone who lets a
petty rivalry get in the way
of the team's success...
[KOSHI RYUNOSUKE] (watching)

175
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,412
[SHOYO TOBIO] (slapped)
[DAICHI] ...gets the boot!

176
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,115
[DAICHI]
You two are banned from
participating in club activities

177
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,385
until you learn to think of
yourselves as teammates!

178
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,099
[SHOYO TOBIO] HUH?!

179
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,953
[SHOYO TOBIO]
What?!

180
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:32,158
[SHOYO] "L‐learn to think of
ourselves as teammates"?!
What's that mean?!
[TOBIO] Beats me!

181
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,195
Please let me in, Captain!
Please let me play volleyball
with you!...

182
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,964
I'll find a way to get along
with Kageyama, I promise!

183
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,468
[SHOYO] Come on, I'm really
sorry! I'll do anything!
[KOSHI] You sure this is wise?
I mean We need players.

184
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:46,540
[KOSHI] You can't build a team
by threatening people to
cooperate; it takes time.
[SHOYO] I wanna play volleyball!

185
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,744
[DAICHI] Yeah I know... but...
[TOBIO] Move, you idiot!
[SHOYO] (knocked over)

186
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:54,047
I apologize! I won't pick any
more fights with him!

187
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,917
Please let me be on the team!

188
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,985
(hopeful, into scared)

189
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,222
[DAICHI]
You mean that?

190
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,290
(nervous)

191
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,427
(discomfort)

192
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,800
[TOBIO]
I can do it. I'll share the
court with him if I have to...

193
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,169
but I still want to
do it all myself...

194
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,138
every spike, receive
and set in the game.

195
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,140
What is wrong
with you?!

196
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,175
(laughter)

197
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,845
I wasn't expecting you to be
THAT honest with me...

198
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,814
Hey, well, it's good enough
for now... But you know...

199
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:33,219
[DAICHI]
In volleyball, it's against the
rules to drop, carry, or touch
the ball twice in a row...

200
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,423
In other words, this game
is impossible to play alone.

201
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,960
[TOBIO] (frown)
[DAICHI] (smile)

202
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:45,832
[SHOYO] So are you mean...
or just stupid?
[TOBIO] (annoyed)

203
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,401
(volleyball efforts)

204
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,903
[DAICHI] Go right!

205
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,440
[DAICHI] Tanaka, follow
through with your block!
[RYUNOSUKE] Sure thing, boss!

206
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:58,411
[SHOYO]
There's a court and a ball
right in front of me. It's
such a tease.

207
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:03,216
Ugh! This is such a stupid
waste of time! I have to
get back in there!

208
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,919
But we're not
teammates yet,
are we?

209
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,754
I have a lot of potential!

210
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,591
[TOBIO]
That should be more than
enough for them to let me
join the team.

211
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:15,128
[SHOYO]
(stunned) Spoken like a true
Ki...(stifle) Uh.. so what
are you gonna do?

212
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:19,533
We'll challenge them to a
two‐on‐two and if we win then
they have to let us join...

213
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:24,204
That way we can at least look
like we're working together as
teammates... It's foolproof.

214
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:28,474
(surprised) Y‐you mean we have
to beat THEM?! What if we lose?

215
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,811
We won't lose...
I'll make sure.

216
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:35,181
[SHOYO, internal] (shocked)
Whoa, is he serious?!
Does he even hear himself?!

217
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,984
You need to do the you best you
can. No screw‐ups.

218
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:41,354
[TOBIO] Do not drag
me down, understand?
[SHOYO] (surprised)

219
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:47,393
Huh?! Don't talk to me
like that! Who's ever
gonna listen to you if you
treat them like trash?!

220
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,596
[TOBIO] Then what's your plan?
[SHOYO] (seething)

221
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,798
[TOBIO] Just sit here and watch
through the window forever?

222
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,900
[SHOYO] (surprised)(deflated)

223
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:58,004
[SHOYO]
My first game...
and my only game...

224
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,240
was the time we
played against you.

225
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,209
[SHOYO]
We never had enough players for
tournaments before that,

226
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:10,283
and I had no place to play, so I
used to practice in the corner
of the gym or in an empty
hallway, or wherever I could.

227
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,953
[TOBIO]
Really?

228
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,188
[SHOYO SHOYO]
So when I got to play
my first game...

229
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,658
and I stood in the middle
of that huge gymnasium...

230
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:24,531
[SHOYO]
I felt like the main
character in a movie.
It was like, "whoaaaa!"

231
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,166
[TOBIO]
"Whoa?"

232
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:29,135
I wanted to stay forever.

233
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,205
But only the strongest...

234
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,676
[TOBIO]
...get to stay on the court.

235
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:40,180
Anyway... they're not gonna let
one of us in without the other.

236
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,049
[SHOYO]
If I get to play volleyball...

237
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:47,320
(focus) then nothing's too much
to deal with.. not even you!

238
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,624
If I try not to look at you..
I don't have to see your dumb
face!

239
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,893
[TOBIO] Keep talking,
short stack!
[SHOYO] (startled)

240
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,528
[KIYOKO] Excuse me.
[TOBIO SHOYO] (look)

241
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,402
I... need to get through.

242
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,971
[SHOYO] (awkward)
[TOBIO] (step back)

243
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,915
Hey Kiyoko! Thanks for your
hard work! Let me get that...

244
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,517
[KIYOKO]
No, thanks. I can
carry it myself.

245
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:19,953
Okay then... You look
super gorgeous today.

246
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:26,159
Ohhh man, she's so pretty
when she ignores me! (bliss)

247
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,262
[SHOYO] (flustered)
[TOBIO] (startled)

248
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,365
(whistle)
[TEAM] Good work, everybody!

249
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,669
You know what I bet those
two goofballs are thinking
right now.

250
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,338
That if they can beat us, then
they'll make the team, right?

251
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,174
Yeah sure... but all they really
have to do is cool off

252
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,444
and prove to everybody that
they've learned their lesson.

253
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,313
[SHOYO TOBIO] Captain!
[DAICHI] (surprised)
[RYUNOSUKE KOSHI] (startled)

254
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,215
[SHOYO TOBIO]
We challenge you to a match!

255
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,585
[RYUNOSUKE] (laughter)
[SHOYO] If we win, you have to
let us join!

256
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,254
[RYUNOSUKE] Guys, I'm psychic!
[SHOYO TOBIO] Now!

257
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:59,192
[SHOYO TOBIO]
We want to prove that we finally
understand how to play together
as teammates!

258
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,494
How many times did
you rehearse that?

259
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:04,731
(laughter) This is gold!
I could get used to having
these clowns on the team!

260
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,399
If you lose?

261
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,469
[SHOYO] (nervous)
[TOBIO] Then you get
to choose the penalty!

262
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,271
[DAICHI]
Huh...

263
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:14,107
[DAICHI]
Club application form.
Here's an idea...

264
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,510
We have two other first‐years
joining the club soon.

265
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,279
[DAICHI]
You'll play against them
in a three‐on‐three match.

266
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,550
[SHOYO TOBIO] (surprised)
[DAICHI] We do this game every
year with our new club members

267
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,219
so we can get an idea
of how they play.

268
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,990
But if it's gonna be
three‐on‐three... then whose
going to be our third player?

269
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:34,094
[DAICHI]
Tanaka... you're with them...
Make sure they behave, alright?

270
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,896
[RYUNOSUKE]
Aww man, why me?

271
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,397
[DAICHI]
Well you seem to like them.

272
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,999
[RYUNOSUKE]
Don't drag me into their mess!

273
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,167
[TOBIO] Uh...
[DAICHI] That's too bad.

274
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:44,771
[DAICHI]
I was thinking you'd be the only
one tough enough to keep these
delinquents in line.

275
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:49,643
[RYUNOSUKE]
(giddy) Aww well, why the
heck not? When you put
it like that...

276
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,879
[SHOYO] (startled)(wincing)
[RYUNOSUKE] Just stick with me,
little man!

277
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:58,585
[DAICHI]
Anyway, here's the penalty if
you lose. For the remainder of
my time here at Karasuno...

278
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,987
[DAICHI]
...Kageyama cannot
be the setter.

279
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:04,791
[TOBIO] Huh?
[SHOYO] (confused) Is that the
only penalty we have, sir?

280
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:10,997
If the setter is aggressive,
self‐centered, and driven by his
own ego... the team can't win.

281
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,699
(pissed)

282
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,802
[DAICHI]
What? I'm not saying I'll reject
your application to join.

283
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,072
[DAICHI]
I'm sure you'll be well‐suited
to a different position.

284
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,008
[TOBIO] (gasp)
No way, I'm a setter!

285
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,977
Then win the game.

286
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:27,413
[DAICHI]
You're the one who thought you
could win without help, right?

287
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,216
[SHOYO] (startled)
Hey, uh.. but what about me?!

288
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,052
We play on Saturday.

289
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,955
Come on! I'm over
here too, you know?

290
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,825
Don't worry! Your cool
upperclassman's gonna show
you the ro‐waahh!

291
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,561
[KOSHI]
See ya!

292
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,637
[KOSHI]
Daichi... Are you being
a little too harsh?

293
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,607
He's right, boss, you're acting
a lot more strict than usual.

294
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:57,277
[KOSHI]
Yeah, Is there some special
reason you're doing this?

295
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,145
[TOBIO] Dammit!

296
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,714
[SHOYO]
What's wrong?

297
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:03,149
Are you mad because you're the
only one who gets penalized?

298
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:07,053
[SHOYO]
Even if you're not a setter, I
bet you'd figure out a different
position just like that!

299
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:12,826
[TOBIO] (annoyed)
[SHOYO] Plus... (hop up) Spikers
are cooler than setters anyway!

300
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,394
They get to go up
and slam the ball!

301
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,463
[TOBIO, annoyed]
(grunt) Stut up!
[SHOYO] (yanked)

302
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,966
The setter is the
team's control tower!

303
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:23,604
[TOBIO]
Plus, it's the position
that gets the most contact
with the ball!

304
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:26,573
It's the greatest position
there is because you get to
be the ruler!

305
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:31,311
[SHOYO] (confused)
[TOBIO] Without a setter to
toss the ball, there wouldn't be
any spikes for you to hit!

306
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,414
I know, but even though the
setter has an important job,

307
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:36,482
you don't really stand
out very much, do you?

308
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,652
[TOBIO] (grunt)
[SHOYO] (shoved)

309
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:42,856
I'm guessing you've never seen
a major volleyball tournament
in person, have you?

310
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,525
[SHOYO] No.

311
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,060
[TOBIO]
You can't tell by the
angle they show on TV,

312
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,429
but pay attention to
the end of the court...

313
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,333
From there, you can see how
fast the setter tosses the ball.

314
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,769
[TOBIO]
It flies straight across the
court... Whoosh!

315
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:59,172
The ball passes right in front
of the face of the other team's
blockers... Then!...

316
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,275
Just when you start to think
"No way! He's never gonna hit
that one!"

317
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:08,715
[TOBIO]
There's a spiker just waiting
to strike... and he smashes
the ball in just in time!

318
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,484
[SHOYO]
Y‐yeah...

319
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:15,088
[TOBIO]
The spiker's job may be
flashier... but...

320
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:19,826
the spiker can't get
through without the setter
to get the opponent to
block and break the wall!

321
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:24,430
It's the most important, cool,
and challenging position on
the court, okay?!

322
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,968
Yeah sure, fine, I get it,
you wanna be the setter.

323
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:30,771
[DAICHI]
Kageyama cannot be the setter.

324
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,406
Dammit! What's with that guy?!

325
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:38,444
All you have to do is win.
You seemed pretty confident
when you challenged them to
a match earlier.

326
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,948
[TOBIO, internal] (irked)
He's right. Not that he'll be
any help.

327
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,985
I'll just focus on setting
up tosses for that creepy
second‐year.

328
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:49,790
Okay! We've got until
Saturday to work on
your crappy receiving!

329
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,259
[SHOYO]
Crappy?! Uh, but we
can't get into the gym...

330
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,428
[TOBIO] (surprised)
[RYUNOSUKE] AHEM...

331
00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:01,401
[TOBIO SHOYO] Uh?
[RYUNOSUKE] I forget...
We start practice at 7 AM
tomorrow, don't we?

332
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:04,037
[KOSHI]
Uh, yeah...? Is that a problem?

333
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,972
[RYUNOSUKE]
Ah! Not at all... A‐anyway,

334
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,374
do you think the Vice
Principal's nappy rug
made it out alive?

335
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:11,244
[SHOYO TOBIO] (listening)
[DAICHI] We're not supposed
to talk about that...

336
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,979
Alright then.

337
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:14,948
5 AM.

338
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,182
Don't be late.

339
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,150
I won't.

340
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,519
(grunt)

341
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,523
(grunt, run efforts)

342
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:27,661
[SHOYO]
Ah, wait! Hang on,
I forgot my bag!

343
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,999
[SHOYO]
Shoulda seen that coming.

344
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,434
[SHOYO] It's locked.

345
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:36,036
[TOBIO]
Okay, let's go
through the window.

346
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,539
[SHOYO]
Are you crazy?! We'd end
up getting expelled!

347
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,942
[RYUNOSUKE]
Man, 5 AM is too early...
[SHOYO] Huh?
[TOBIO] Hm?

348
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,510
[SHOYO] Tanaka?!
(RYUNOSUKE yawns)

349
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,280
You got 2 hours...
and then beat it!

350
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,784
[SHOYO] You're awesome!
[TOBIO] Thank you!

351
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:55,188
[RYUNOSUKE] (laugh)
Yeah, who's your hero,
first‐years? Call me Sir Tanaka!

352
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,356
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Sir Tanaka!

353
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,859
[RYUNOSUKE]
(laugh) What was that?

354
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,326
[SHOYO TOBIO]
Sir Tanaka!

355
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:04,364
[RYUNOSUKE] (laughs)
Okay, punks, let's get crackin'!

356
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:08,569
[SHOYO] (excited)
[RYUNOSUKE] He's right, boss,
you're acting a lot more strict
than usual.

357
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:11,738
[KOSHI]
Yeah, is there some special
reason you're doing this?

358
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:16,710
Well, sort of... You
saw those two play last
year... Think back.

359
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,813
[DAICHI]
Kageyama had exceptional talent
for a middle schooler,

360
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:22,182
but now he's got almost
nothing to show for it...

361
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:27,253
If nothing changes, that
lone wolf personality of his
will hold him back in high
school too.

362
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:32,458
[DAICHI]
I don't want him dragging
this team down... The big
difference now is...

363
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,362
[DAICHI]
...that he and Hinata are
on the same team.

364
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:42,002
What, Hinata? Oh yeah, I
guess he's kind of a crazy
ball of energy and agility.

365
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:45,205
[DAICHI]
Right, but he hasn't
reached his potential.

366
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:49,943
[DAICHI]
He's got incredible speed and
quick reflexes, not to mention
that jumping power...

367
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:53,179
but he never played with
a real setter before.

368
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,151
[DAICHI]
Kageyama, on the other hand,
wants a spiker fast enough to
hit the sets he makes.

369
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:03,423
[DAICHI]
Separately, their abilities
are limited. But put them
together...

370
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:11,497
[DAICHI]
and let them work on
some combinations...

371
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,969
[DAICHI]
Karasuno will have
the perfect team!

372
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:20,040
[DAICHI]
It's gonna be fantastic.

373
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,208
[SHOYO]
Outta my way! I'm gonna be
the first one on that court!

374
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,878
[TOBIO]
(struggling) You can't be first
if Tanaka's already in, dumbass!

375
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:26,847
[SHOYO]
Then why don't you let me go!?

376
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:31,184
[RYUNOSUKE] We don't
have time for this...
[TOBIO SHOYO] (fall over)

377
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:34,888
[RYUNOSUKE, internal]
Sorry, boss, we've got a
long way to go on those
combinations. (grin)

378
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,625
[SHOYO] Wow, check it out!

379
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,527
[RYUNOSUKE]
You were just here yesterday.

380
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:45,098
[SHOYO, internal]
This is the same gym where the
Tiny Giant used to practice.

381
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:51,404
[SHOYO, internal]
Alright! Let's do this!

382
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,765
[TOBIO]
Leave it to you to ruin
things from the start.

383
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:27,133
[SHOYO]
What?! You're the one who thinks
you can play without a team!

384
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,069
[TOBIO]
I'd rather go it alone
than work with you!

385
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,971
[SHOYO] Why are
you so stubborn?!
[RYUNOSUKE] Clock's ticking!

386
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:33,640
[RYUNOSUKE] Less yapping,
more practicing!
[SHOYO TOBIO] Right!

387
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,710
[SHOYO] Next Haikyu,
"The Most Powerful Ally."

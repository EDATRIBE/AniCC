00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,500
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

2
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,541
[HARUHI groaning]

3
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:45,791
[KYON] My ride aint swift,
'cause my gears won't shift.

4
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,125
[sighs] What a pain.

5
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:53,916
[KYON]
I'm home!

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,375
Man. Was it cold out--

7
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,625
[KYON'S SISTER]
Hi-yah! Welcome back attack!

8
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,791
[KYON groans] A simple greeting
that suddenly transforms

9
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,416
into a malicious attack.

10
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,000
You've got great skills, sis.

11
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,833
Loser. You went off by yourself

12
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,208
and had fun without me,
didn't you?!

13
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,750
Poor Shamisen was forced
to play with me all day.

14
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,250
He says you suck,
so that was payback for him.

15
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,625
For Shamisen?!

16
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,458
[KYON groans]

17
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,250
So tired.

18
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,541
I probably should've
just taken her with me.

19
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,625
[MIKURU]
Teeter-totter, teeter-totter...

20
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,166
Huh? I think Kyon's
tryin' to fall asleep.

21
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,125
We'll have him count sheep
so he can get to sleep faster.

22
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,583
C'mon! Jump!

23
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,750
Get up and jump through that
hoop so he can count you!

24
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:42,083
I can't sleep while
she's being tortured!

25
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,208
Uh... Where am I?

26
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:51,041
Let's see. I was lying in bed,
started counting sheep...

27
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:55,666
Played the straight man,
then after that... Oh, I get it.

28
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,541
I'm dreaming!

29
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:01,375
I'm really sorry, Miss Sheep...
I fell asleep on you.

30
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,750
[KOIZUMI chuckles]
You're such a bad person.

31
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:04,916
Huh?

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,458
Hello, I'll be playing
Mount Fuji today.

33
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,000
[KYON]
Whoa! Weirdo in the house!

34
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,666
What? Is that any way
to greet your friend?

35
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,083
It's just, that if I admit
you're Koizumi, I'm pretty sure

36
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,000
a lot of people are
gonna get mad at me.

37
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,916
Who cares? It's just
a dream, isn't it?

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,833
[KYON] Thanks for a reminder,
Captain Obvious!

39
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,208
Do you like the outfit?

40
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,125
It's good luck to have a
New Year's dream with either

41
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,833
Fuji, a hawk, or an eggplant.

42
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:24,708
[KYON]
Who asked you?!

43
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,166
Why are you getting so upset?

44
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,750
Now that I'm Fuji,
the best omen you can get,

45
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,375
I'm going to bring you
bunches of joy and happiness.

46
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,125
It freaks me out to see you
in that get-up, smiling at me.

47
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,416
[KOIZUMI]
Naturally.

48
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,166
And I seriously doubt
that you could bring me

49
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,916
bunches of joy and happiness.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,583
[KOIZUMI]
What?! That's impossible.

51
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,708
I can't believe you figured out

52
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,416
that I'm just a
plain old mountain.

53
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,875
How did you know
I couldn't bring you

54
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,083
bunches of joy and happiness?!

55
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,083
You're not Mount Fuji?!

56
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,458
[KYON]
Grow big!

57
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,916
[KOIZUMI]
He's turned into a shinjin!

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,916
[KYON sighs]

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,375
[KYON] Don't say anything
to anyone about this!

60
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,791
I got a little carried away.

61
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,208
I'm glad you changed
back to your normal self.

62
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,625
I was gonna try yelling
at you to snap you out of it,

63
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,666
but I guess that would've
been really weird.

64
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,416
Believe me. You couldn't be
any weirder in that outfit.

65
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,791
[KOIZUMI]
Oh? You think?

66
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,583
Maybe I should go and find
the other two omens now.

67
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,333
[KOIZUMI] The hawk's been
up there this whole time.

68
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,000
[KYON]
That thing's a hawk?!

69
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:24,875
Hi, I'm a hawk.

70
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,791
[KYON]
No way, you're a crane!

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,041
[TSURUYA] Kyon... you shouldn't
judge a person by how they look.

72
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,916
Inside this crane
beats the heart of a hawk!

73
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,500
You're still a crane though.

74
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,000
[TSURUYA]
Well, yeah.

75
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,000
So where's the eggplant?

76
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,875
With the way things are going, I
bet it's around here somewhere.

77
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,125
Let me trying calling her.

78
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,250
[KYON]
You have a cell phone?!

79
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,333
[phone rings]

80
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,541
[KYON]
Huh? What's that doing there?

81
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,208
Hello there, Miss Nagato.

82
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,166
Ah-ha, so Nagato's the eggplant.

83
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,250
[KOIZUMI grunts]

84
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,708
It was lying on
the ground over here.

85
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,000
You should've told us
that you found Miss Nagato.

86
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:00,958
Good for you.

87
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,833
I was talking about the phone.

88
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,833
[KOIZUMI]
So was I. Look at the strap.

89
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:05,916
Why? What's on the--?

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,500
--I am the eggplant.
--It's her!

91
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,750
[KYON] Okay, so, now that
I've found everyone...

92
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,000
Well...

93
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,000
[BOTH]
What?!

94
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,208
[KYON]
I'm done! I wanna wake up!

95
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,583
We can't really
help you with that.

96
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,833
[KYON]
What's that supposed to mean?!

97
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,500
It means, we can't
really help you with that.

98
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,833
But, you did manage to find
the only person among us

99
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,250
who's ever been able to help
you in the past, didn't you?

100
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,000
Nagato! Yeah, that's right!

101
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,791
You know when you wink at me,
that also sorta freaks me out.

102
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,333
[KOIZUMI]
I know.

103
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,666
Okay, Nagato! Tell me how to
wake up from this crazy dream!

104
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,875
Go to sleep here, and
wake up in the real world.

105
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:38,875
That's it?

106
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,125
That's it.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,916
[birds chirping]

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,791

[MIKURU]
Teeter-totter, teeter-totter...

110
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,166
Huh? I think Kyon's
tryin' to fall asleep.

111
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,000
We'll have him count sheep
so he can get to sleep faster.

112
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,458
C'mon! Jump!

113
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,583
Get up and jump through that
hoop so he can count you!

114
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,875
Stop torturing her like that!

115

[KYON humming]

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,083
[KYON]
Knock, knock. Anyone home?

121
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,416
[HARUHI]
Come in.

122
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,041
Hey.

123
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,666
I'm bored!

124
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,666
Why haven't any clients
walked through the door?!

125
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,708
I'm bored! Bored! Bored!

126
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,541
Bored, bored, bored!

127
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,583
[HARUHI yelling]
Uh?

128
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,958
[KYON]
Same old Haruhi. What a spaz.

129
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,166
Geez.

130
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,500
I'm just gonna stay
like this and fidget.

131
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,875
--[door opens]
--Would you calm down?

132
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,416
--[HARUHI] Fidget. Fidget...
--[KYON] Someone's here.

133
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,625
[KYON] It's your fault
we lost that one.

134
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,208
[HARUHI]
Dammit!

135
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,250
[HARUHI groans]

136
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,833
[HARUHI]
That hurt.

137
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,875
[KYON]
I bet. Can I go home?

138
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,833
[knocks]

139
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,166
Hey.

140
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,083
Hm? Just you, huh?

141
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,625
[VOICE IN GAME]
Oh, no! It hurts so good.

142
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:41,666
[grunts] Are you... playing
what I think you're playing?

143
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,833
[yells]
So, you like that stuff?

144
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:48,958
You know it.

145
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,333
Oh. Okay then.

146
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,958
[KYON] They say hobbies
are good for you,

147
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,708
and I'm really
happy you found one.

148
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,916
But, um, you might
want to use headphones

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,333
so you don't bother anyone.

150
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,708
That's what all the
good kids do, anyway.

151
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,666
[KYON]
Hm?

152
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,500
--Play with me.
--No, I'm good!

153
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,666
I... can't... move my body.

154
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,958
Ha, ha.

155
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,916
What will Haruhi Suzumiya
do after I kill you?

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,625
[KYON]
What are you doing, Asakura?

157
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,166
Now, you die.

00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,750
[YUKI]
I forf--

159
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,833
[KYON]
Nagato, you all right?

160
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:25,916
I'm fine.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,208
[KYON]
Really? You don't look so hot.

162
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,875
You won this time. But if you
think this means you're safe,

163
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:36,375
think again. I'm the weakest
of the Four Radical Lords.

164
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,833
And you'll be meeting
the others soon enough.

165
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,083
[KYON]
What a generic set-up.

166
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,416
[ASAKURA]
Then, there are three others

167
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,375
who rule over the first four...

00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,208
Huh? Where is everybody?

174
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,125
Uh... Hm.

175
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,958
Mikuru, are you watching?!

176
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,208
Waugh!

177
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,291
Time for your favorite
local quiz show!

178
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,541
Are you smarter
than the SOS Brigade?

179
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,041
Now, let's introduce
today's contestants!

180
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,250
First up, we have Yuki Nagato!

181
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,541
[bell dings]

182
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,541
[HARUHI] Uh, Yuki,
don't press the button yet.

183
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,041
And next is... that guy.

184
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,000
Uh! Say my name!
It's only one syllable.

185
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,375
Hey, Koizumi,
give me the camera.

186
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,375
This is our cameraman, Koizumi.

187
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,666
Pleased to meet you!

188
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,416
[KYON]
You introduced the cameraman?!

189
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,166
Let's move on to
the quiz, shall we?

190
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,166
The first topic is the universe.

191
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,250
There's nothing
local about that!

192
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,708
Shut it, Kyon.

193
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,833
Oh, okay. If you
really want local topics

194
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,625
then I'll just
change the question.

195
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,458
Let's see... Hm...

196
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,583
Oh!

197
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,041
What's the name of
that dog over there?

198
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,583
[KYON]
Too random!

199
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,125
You have 30 minutes to answer
the question, starting now.

200
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,333
[KYON]
Too long!

201
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,791
[HARUHI] Time's up.
May I have your answers?

202
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:16,875
[KYON]
Uh!

203
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,250
[bell dings]

204
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,458
[HARUHI] You only have
to press the button

205
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,000
during the lightning
round, okay?

206
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,500
The correct answer is...

207
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,666
[KYON]
You took so long they left.

208
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,666
Good try, but the correct
answer is "Gonzales"!

209
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,875
[KYON]
Liar!

210
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,833
[HARUHI] Next up we
have Truck versus Kyon.

211
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,125
--Who do you think will win?
--[MIKURU laughs]

212
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,375
[KYON]
I'm not doing that!

213
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,250
[HARUHI]
It's a tiny little pickup truck.

214
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,875
Here're some fireworks.

215
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,333
[KYON]
What? Why?

216
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,750
I don't care how small
it is! I'm not doing it.

217
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,458
Wait. You lit the fuses!

218
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,875
-[engine revs]
-Dear god, I'm a human sparkler!

219
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,166
Wha-What's that?
The truck's here!

220
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,458
[KYON screams]

221
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,416
[KYON] I don't want
to die like this!

222
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,666
[explosion]

223
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,208
Farewell. You will live in
our hearts forever, Kyon.

224
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,541
[KYON]
I'm not quite dead.

225
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,291
Whoa. You're still alive?
You're pretty tough.

226
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,791
[KYON]
I was revived.

227
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,458
After the fireworks exploded I--

228
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,500
[bell dings]

229
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,083
Yuki, your timing
still needs work.

230
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,916
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,958
[HARUHI groaning]

232
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,791
Miss Nagato,
I brought your tea--

233
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,083
[screams]

234
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,750
--Oh, Kyon!
--What's wrong?

235
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,125
Miss Nagato... I just
saw her and she's...

236
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,166
[KYON]
What about Nagato?

237
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,833
Well, uh, it's just...
She's uh...

238
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,208
Never mind.

239
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,250
[KYON]
Hm?

240
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,625
[knock]

241
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,166
Hang in there, guys.

242
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,916
[HARUHI]
Uh?

243
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,125
[HARUHI]
Huh?

244
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,666
[HARUHI]
Huh?!

245
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,500
Hey, Kyon, does Yuki
have any sisters?

246
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,000
[KYON]
Huh?

247
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:59,166
[MIKURU humming]

248
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,583
[MIKURU]
Hm?

249
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,458
I've never seen these before!
Whose are they?!

250
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,333
Oh, I haven't seen you
reading a book in forever.

251
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,208
I always thought you were
more of a bookworm than--

252
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,625
Whoa! A strategy guide?!

253
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,541
You don't really use
those things, do you?

254
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,875
I mean, if you really wanted
to beat a game that bad,

255
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,583
couldn't you just hack into it?

256
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,583
But that would be
considered cheating.

257
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,666
[KYON]
Oh, right. Sorry...

258
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,416
Hm? Do you want me
play that with you?

259
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,000
Sure. I can play one round.

260
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,500
A fighting game, huh?

261
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,166
[NAGATO] Select character
and difficulty level.

262
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,250
Hang on. Difficulty level?
Who am I setting that for?

263
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,458
For me.

264
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,916
[KYON] Whoa. She's been
playing this a lot.

265
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,833
[ASAKURA laughs]

266
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:46,125
[ASAKURA] Poor Miss Nagato.
She has no clue that I've made

267
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,750
a back-up copy of myself.

268
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,000
Ryoko Achakura has returned!

269
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,250
[ASAKURA sighs]

270
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,291
This isn't good... What in
the world could've gone wrong?

271
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,750
[gasps]

272
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,541
Miss Nagato! You knew I'd
return someday, didn't you?

273
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,791
Let me out! Let me out!

274
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:12,833
Huh?

275
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,791
Ha! Now that I'm free,
prepare for your doom!

276
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,166
As soon as I return
to my normal size,

277
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,583
I will put an end
to you and him--

278
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,125
Save me, please!

279
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,000
[ASAKURA yelps]

280
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:29,333
[ASAKURA panting]

281
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,375
[gasps]

282
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,208
[ASAKURA]
Miss Nagato... you saved m--

283
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,166
[ASAKURA]
Let me out! Let me out!

284
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,083
[ASAKURA]
Let me get this straight.

285
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,250
You want me to move in with you?

286
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,083
[NAGATO] Yes. It will be
easier to observe you.

287
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,541
[ASAKURA]
I see...

288
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,833
[ASAKURA grunts]

289
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,250
[ASAKURA]
Uh, do you have another chair?

290
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,333
I do not.

291
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,916
You have to have something else!

292
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,208
Stack two cushions
together or something!

293
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,750
I only have two cushions,
including mine.

294
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,625
I'll take it! I'll fold that
one in half and sit on it!

295
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,666
[ASAKURA sighs]

296
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,666
[NAGATO]
I will prepare dinner for us.

297
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,625
[squeaking]

298
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,250
[ASAKURA yelps]

299
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,125
Oh, you decided
to use the chair.

300
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,791
[ASAKURA]
Let's not talk about it.

301
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,625
[YUKI]
Here you are.

302
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:30,208
[ASAKURA gasping]

303
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,041
I was joking.

304
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,791
[ASAKURA]
Huh?! Really?

305
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,458
Was it not obvious?

306
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,500
[ASAKURA] Well, you did
bring me here in a bag.

307
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,083
Considering my
current situation,

308
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,500
I assumed that's how you
were going to treat me.

309
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,333
I see. I will correct that.

310
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,083
[ASAKURA grunts]

311
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,000
[NAGATO]
Here you are.

312
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,250
[ASAKURA yelps]
Change the bowl!

313
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,291
[YUKI]
Oh.

314
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,166
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

315
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,208
[HARUHI groaning]

316
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,583
[COMPUTER CLUB LEADER]
Guess what?

317
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,625
The computer club just made
this dodge ball video game,

318
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,583
and we wanna challenge
you guys to a match.

319
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,833
I decline!

320
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,125
[ALL groaning]

321
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,750
Man, I'm bored.

322
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,833
[KYON]
Do you not see the irony here?

323
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,666
[slurping]

324
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,708
[HARUHI sighs]

325
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,541
Speak.

326
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,791
O... Kay.

327
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,500
We just made this
dodge ball video game,

328
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,416
and wanna challenge
you guys to a match.

329
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,416
And if we win, you have to
give back all our computers!

330
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,958
A game, huh? And?

331
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,208
What?

332
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,166
If we beat you guys,
what are we gonna get?

333
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,750
Uh. Well, I...

334
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,541
[HARUHI] Last time ya lost you
agreed to obey my every command.

335
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,125
You don't have much to bet,
except your lives.

336
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,208
Our lives?!

337
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,041
Well, make me an offer.

338
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,416
Fine. We'll bet this.

339
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,208
[MIKURU screams]

340
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,125
[KOIZUMI laughs]

341
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,208
[KYON]
The price tag's on it!

342
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,291
It is composed of
30% chicken bones,

343
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,041
40% monkey bones,
and 30% turtle bones.

344
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,583
[HARUHI]
Ha, ha! Deal! Game on!

345
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,458
[COMPUTER CLUB LEADER]
Uh. Really?!

00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,583
Ha, ha! Look at Kyon gobble it!

689
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:42,666
Go for it, Kyon! Inhale it!

690
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,416
[KYON groaning]

691
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,083
[NAGATO munching]

692
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:48,541
[distant chattering, laughing]

693
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:51,416
[TANIGUCHI]
I guess... I'll eat some beans.

694
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,458
[distant chattering, laughing]

695
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,125
[TANIGUCHI belches]

696
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,458
Looks like she's trying
to pick a fight with me.

697
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,250
Well two can play at this game!

698
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,833
Ahh! You can't fool me!

699
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,583
Wait!

700
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:20,041
Oh, she got me.

701
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,958
Uh. You've beaten me again.

702
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,916
Setting such an obvious trap
was a stroke of genius.

703
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,625
My lapse in judgement has proven
to be my downfall yet again.

704
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,583
You must have a reason for
going through all this trouble

705
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:33,291
to trap me! Well? What is it?

706
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,375
It's good you
catch on so quickly.

707
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:38,000
I have something that
I would like you to wear.

708
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,750
[ASAKURA] I'm your prisoner,
so I can't refuse your request.

709
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,583
Whatever it is, I'll wear it.

710
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,583
[YUKI]
Negations complete.

711
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:47,250
I wouldn't call what just
happened a negotiation.

712
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,500
I just hope the
outfit's cute, is all.

713
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:52,666
Could you've picked
a heavier kimono?!

714
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,166
Sorry about that. You can sit
here and relax for a while.

715
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,583
Oh, thank you. That's better.

716
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,583
[ASAKURA]
Hm...

717
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,833
[ASAKURA]
Now I get it!

718
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:08,166
I don't care how much dessert
you bribe me with, I'm through!

719
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,458
Ahh! I don't believe it...

720
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,125
This must be the
legendary "obi spinning"

721
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,416
I've been hearing about!

722
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,250
I won't let you
get away with this!

723
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,208
[NAGATO] You know you want it.
You know want it...

724
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:20,708
[ASAKURA]
Oh, my!

725
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:25,416
[ASAKURA laughs]

726
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:47,083
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

727
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,125
[HARUHI groaning]

728
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:54,166
[HARUHI] The SOS Brigade is
going to make a melodrama.

729
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,000
I just wanna shake
things up around here,

730
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,458
cause it's startin'
to get boring.

731
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,166
I mean, every time
we have a quiz,

732
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,375
the same thing always happens.
Kyon ends up exploding.

733
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,166
It's not like I want to explode!

734
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,833
We're gonna go around
the room right now,

735
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:08,791
and I want everyone to
give me an idea for a story.

736
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:09,750
You first, Kyon.

737
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:10,875
Wait! I... What?!

738
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,333
You're not even listening.

739
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,333
Okay. Um, here's an idea.

740
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,458
It's typical, but could
have the main character

741
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:19,208
dying from a disease
or something.

742
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:20,916
[HARUHI]
Great idea! 

743
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,541
[KYON]
Overreact, much?

744
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,875
It's genius.

745
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,250
A tragic hero staring
death straight in the eye.

746
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:30,416
Brilliant. Yes. Good.
Good one, Kyon.

747
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,166
[KYON] Oh, cut it out.
You're embarrassing me.

748
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,458
Okay, Koizumi. Whatcha got?

749
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,791
You think your idea
can top Kyon's?

750
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,000
I'll give it a shot.

751
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,791
How about a story with
a romantic triangle,

752
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:44,041
like those ones you see
in daytime soap operas?

753
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,125
[HARUHI screams]

754
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:46,375
[HARUHI]
Stealing someone else's lover!

755
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,166
Love then hate, then revenge!
It's perfect!

756
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,333
You feeling all right?

757
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:53,625
I'll be okay.
Just give me a second.

758
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,583
My vision's a little
blurry, that's all.

759
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,875
If your vision is blurry,
you're not okay.

760
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:58,625
Otaku.

761
00:33:58,708 --> 00:33:59,166
[HARUHI]
Ah!

762
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,166
Or maids.

763
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:00,916
[HARUHI]
Ah!

764
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,166
Supply and demand!

765
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,083
We'll give the otaku
what they wanna see.

766
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,625
Welcome home, Master!

767
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,416
[KYON]
I'm totally lost now.

768
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,916
[HARUHI] All right,
I came up with a story

769
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,708
using all the ideas
we thought of.

770
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:15,541
I want you guys to check it out
and tell me what you think.

771
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,375
It's called "The Gift
of the Maid Part 2:

772
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,916
The Battle for Stolen Love
With Only One Month to Live."

773
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,041
[KYON] It sounds like
some cheesy game show.

774
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,541
And why is it part two?

775
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:27,291
The title pretty much gives
away all the kung fu action.

776
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,750
No it doesn't! There's
nothing kung fu about it!

777
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:32,250
Well, it is about stolen love.

778
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:35,500
[KYON] Okay, then. Let's go
with that. Picturing it...

779
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:38,416
[HARUHI] All the characters
in the story are maids!

780
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,916
[KYON]
Us too?!

781
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,250
Everyone in the story's a maid.
And they love maids, too.

782
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,958
They get into crazy
fights to decide

783
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,333
who loves maids the most.

784
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,375
They could decide in a
more maid-ly manner...

785
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,291
So at the end of the month,
all the characters die?

786
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,625
If the fighting doesn't
kill 'em first. [chuckles]

787
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,541
What are you saying?!
You should die.

788
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,458
Okay. If the story's
about stolen love,

789
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:00,791
then who's going to become
the hero couple at the end?

790
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,458
Well the last two maids
standing, of course.

791
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,375
The last two, huh?

792
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:07,416
But the only characters
left at the end

793
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,416
are Kyon's and Koizumi's.

794
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,000
Uh-huh. 'Cause only guys can
survive a fight that brutal.

795
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,166
[MIKURU]
Uh...

796
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,208
[HARUHI]
Hm?

797
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,166
You like that, huh, Mu-chan?

798
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:22,916
According to this,

799
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,083
the first battle's between
you and me, Nagato.

800
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,375
So it seems.

801
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,500
[KYON] "Scene one,
Nagato's Aerial Chop.

802
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,833
It has to look authentic,
so I want you to really hit him.

803
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:33,958
This attack will break Kyon's
bones in about 26 places.

804
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:37,583
Then, Kyon uses his first-aid
power-up and becomes invincible.

805
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:39,875
He wins, just barely."

806
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:43,583
Hang on, you are gonna be
careful not to kill me, right?

807
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:44,666
[NAGATO]
Chop.

808
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,708
[KYON screams]

809
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,541
[KYON]
I'm turning into light!

810
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:56,500
And we still ended
with an explosion.

811
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,416
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

812
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,458
[HARUHI groaning]

813
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,000
[ASAKURA]
After I get up in the morning,

814
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:30,541
I usually wake
Miss Nagato up, too.

815
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,291
But it's Sunday today, so I
think I'm gonna let her sleep in

816
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:34,708
a little while longer.

817
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,000
It's too bright.

818
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,541
Go to sleep!

819
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,708
Whatever, I'll go wash my face.

820
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Oh, no! I can't
do this by myself!

821
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:49,250
I kicked her pretty hard.
I doubt she'll be waking soon.

822
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,500
There's only one way to do this.

823
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:53,500
The wall-jumping technique!

824
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:56,958
[ASAKURA grunting]

825
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,958
Ahhh!

826
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,250
[ASAKURA]
Oh...

827
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,125
I'm feeling hungry.

828
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,500
What happened to you?

829
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:09,916
Oh. My face. Water...

830
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,250
Understood.

831
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:12,833
[screaming]

832
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:13,833
What are you doing?!

833
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,583
According to the
data you provided,

834
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,750
I chose the option that was
the easiest for you to react to.

835
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,125
[ASAKURA]
Don't make me react!

836
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,041
[growling]

837
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,833
Face the fury of my vengeance!

838
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:24,916
Ah!

839
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,166
[BOTH]
Uh...

840
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,625
Yuki! 'Bout time you showed up!

841
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,666
You're never late.
What happened to you?

842
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,250
[NAGATO]
I was unconscious.

843
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,583
You're kidding! What it
an enemy?! Are you okay?

844
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:37,791
[NAGATO]
Do not worry.

845
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,833
It wasn't an enemy.
I am fine now.

846
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:43,583
Everything's fine.
Everything's normal.

847
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,125
[NAGATO]
You sure about that?

848
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:49,541
[ASAKURA singing]

849
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,125
[ASAKURA sighs]

850
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:54,583
Rats. I guess Miss Nagato went
to go hang out with Kyon again.

851
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,291
I shouldn't be cleaning
up around here!

852
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,166
I'm one of the radicals!

853
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,083
That does it. I'm going out!

854
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:03,958
Not again!

855
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:07,166
Oh, geez. Right, door.

856
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,041
[ASAKURA]
Uh! Success! This is great.

857
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,333
Umbrellas can reach
up really high.

858
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,875
From now on, I'm gonna use
my umbrella for everything.

859
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,000
[ASAKURA laughs]

860
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:24,416
Nothing stands in the way of my
umbrella! Not even the elevator.

861
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,666
Better watch out, Kyon.

862
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:30,083
Because I'm coming up
to kill you! [chuckles]

863
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:38,916
Meow.

864
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,958
[ASAKURA] Children shouldn't
go out on their own.

865
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:47,875
The world can be a dangerous
place sometimes.

866
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,541
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

867
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:10,583
[HARUHI groaning]

868
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,583
[door opens]

869
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:16,541
[NAGATO]
I'm home.

870
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,208
[ASAKURA]
Oh! Welcome back.

871
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,208
[ASAKURA]
Huh?

872
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:24,583
Ah! Please don't...

873
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:27,916
Hey, Yuki! Thanks for
letting us come over today!

874
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,166
[HARUHI]
Ahem!

875
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,541
The SOS Brigade No Boys
Allowed Heart-Throbbing

876
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:34,708
Valentine's Day Chocolate
Making Party is about to begin.

877
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,541
[ALL]
Yay!

878
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:39,166
Okay Mikuru. Hurry up
and take your clothes off.

879
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,000
What for? A bath?

880
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,750
I was thinking we could
make a life-size,

881
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,166
Mikuru-shaped chocolate.

882
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,291
No! I don't want to!

883
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:49,166
Ha, ha, ha!
You know you want to.

884
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,375
A large human shaped chocolate
would be unusually difficult

885
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:54,041
to maintain and preserve.

886
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,125
Oh, well. Whatever.
It was worth a shot.

887
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:57,875
[MIKURU] You mean you guys
really would've done it

888
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,625
if it were possible?

889
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:01,041
[HARUHI]
I just realized something.

890
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,125
We're gonna have lots
of left-over chocolate.

891
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,875
[TSURUYA]
She's right!

892
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,166
I know! We'll be able to
use up all the chocolate

893
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,041
if we just make
whatever we want.

894
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,750
Great idea! And we
can eat the mistakes.

895
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,708
[MIKURU]
Is this arts and crafts?

896
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,625
All done!

897
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,458
Oh, I know this.
It's a Picasso, right?

898
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,875
I didn't know you were
so artistic, Haru-nyan.

899
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,000
It's Kyon's head.

900
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:25,875
[BOTH]
Wha?!

901
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:28,583
The likeness is 99.8% accurate.

902
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:31,166
However, people who still
rely on vision to see

903
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,291
will not be able to
tell the resemblance.

904
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:37,041
[HARUHI] I can't tell whether
that was a compliment or not.

905
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,583
[HARUHI]
Did you make a lion?

906
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:40,208
Yes, this is Mu-chan.

907
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:42,541
[HARUHI]
Wow! It looks great.

908
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,000
And you made a crane.

909
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,333
Uh-huh.

910
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:47,583
[HARUHI] I could see these
hangin' out in a garden.

911
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:50,416
Is yours all done, Yuki?

912
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,416
[NAGATO]
Here.

913
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,000
[HARUHI]
Are those chocolate bars?

914
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,916
[TSURUYA] They look just like
they did before we melted them.

915
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,625
[MIKURU] Wait. Didn't we
use up all of our ingredients?

916
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,208
No way! She made these out
of that lump of chocolate.

917
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,416
That's amazing!

918
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,541
I know. It's amazing
how pointless they are.

919
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,083
We still have a lot left over,

920
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:09,583
so let's make a couple
batches of the usual things.

921
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:12,875
I can totally handle putting
the powdered chocolate on.

922
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:14,708
And I can wrap 'em all up!

923
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:16,291
Stand back and watch
as I demonstrate

924
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,125
the wrapping technique
of Tsuruya's Candy Store.

925
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,333
What are you doing?!

926
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:23,625
[sighs]

927
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,208
[HARUHI]
I should be angry,

928
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:28,041
but I'm blown away by how many
you munched before we noticed.

929
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,666
[MIKURU]
That's amazing!

930
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,541
[HARUHI]
Okay guys. Now what do we do?

931
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,041
We're about to run
out of ingredients.

932
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,541
Why don't we take
what we have left,

933
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:37,666
and make two chocolate
cakes out of it?

934
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,791
That's a good idea!
Let's do that.

935
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,083
[HARUHI] They'll never
know we almost ran out.

936
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,250
[TSURUYA] Use what ya got
till it's all gone, Haru-nyan.

937
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,083
Huh?

938
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:50,833
Thanks for having us over!
See you tomorrow!

939
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:52,833
[door closes]

940
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,125
[ASAKURA]
Have they all gone home?

941
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,666
[NAGATO]
They have.

942
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,708
I didn't know what was going on
when you put me in that box.

943
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:06,250
I understand why you did it,
but I'm not happy about it.

944
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,958
Not that I ever had a choice--

945
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:11,958
--[ASAKURA screams]
--[NAGATO] Oh.

946
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:15,000
What's going on?! Tell me why
there's a spring attached to me!

947
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,875
I can't.

948
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:19,416
You've been wanting to do this
to me since the beginning.

949
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,000
Well I have news for you!

950
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:24,375
I've been going easy on you
this... whole... time.

951
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,958
What do you think I am?
A jack-in-the-box?!

952
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:30,208
--[clonk]
--[groaning]

953
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:33,750
[ASAKURA cries]

954
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,708
[NAGATO]
Here. This is for you.

955
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:38,750
[ASAKURA]
Huh? Uh!

956
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,958
It's a piece of
the cake she made.

957
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,958
[ASAKURA]
Hm...

958
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,958
If she expects me to
forgive her shoddy treatment

959
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:48,916
by accepting a piece of cake,
she's got another thing coming!

960
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,458
I mean, I'm flattered she
even saved a piece for me.

961
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,083
But there's no way
I'm going to be tempted

962
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:54,833
by a measly little morsel of--

963
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:58,166
[stomach growls]

964
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,291
[ASAKURA]
Whatever. Just this once.

965
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:22,875
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

966
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:23,916
[HARUHI groaning]

967
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:28,875
[HARUHI]
Ahem! Attention!

968
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:31,083
Since today is Valentine's Day,

969
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:34,291
and since the SOS Brigade
observes all special occasions,

970
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:36,166
we, the girls of the brigade,
had no choice

971
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,041
but to make you boys
some chocolates.

972
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,291
Oh, uh, thank you!

973
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:40,875
Yes. Thank you very much.

974
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:41,875
[HARUHI]
Stop!

975
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:43,416
[KYON gasps]
Why can't I open it?

976
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,125
We, the girls of
the SOS Brigade,

977
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,458
think it's boring and archaic
in these modern times

978
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,041
to just hand out chocolates
and go about our business.

979
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,333
After all, we worked
hard to make those.

980
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:54,416
Just because you're boys,
doesn't give you the right

981
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,458
to eat those chocolates!
You have to earn 'em!

982
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:58,916
[KYON]
What does she want?!

983
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,208
[DEEP VOICE]
Too vague.

984
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:02,291
I think I understand
your intention here.

985
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,666
You want us to do something
for you that would make you

986
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,333
want to give us the chocolates
in return, correct?

987
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:09,500
Yeah. I guess that's
what I was goin' for.

988
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,291
What do you mean?
Don't you know?

989
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:13,666
Well? Do you have
any ideas for us?

990
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,458
Yes, possibly. Sorry.
Give me a second here.

991
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:19,333
I just have to fire off
this request for supplies.

992
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:22,125
Anyway, we could always try
doing nothing for our something,

993
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:25,125
and get the chocolates that way.
It's definitely worth a shot.

994
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,541
Huh?

995
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,958
[KOIZUMI] For example,
I've got a candy bar for you.

996
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,083
Happy Valentine's Day!

997
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,458
[KYON]
No thank you!

998
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:34,375
Oh, that's too bad.
You didn't accept my valentine.

999
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,583
But if you had taken it,

1000
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:37,208
I would've been the
person giving something

1001
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,250
instead of the one
getting something.

1002
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:41,833
Therefore, you'd be obliged
to return the favor.

1003
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:43,250
[KYON] Yeah, but,
if you apply that logic

1004
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,833
to our situation with Haruhi,

1005
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,541
you still have to do something
in order to get the chocolate.

1006
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,625
[KOIZUMI]
You're so sharp.

1007
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:50,000
[KYON]
Why you...

1008
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:52,000
[KOIZUMI] I'm sorry.
I was just stalling for time.

1009
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:56,791
Oh, would you mind
stepping back a bit?

1010
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:58,250
Huh?

1011
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,041
[KYON gasping]

1012
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:07,458
Hello there. I'm just
an ordinary maid.

1013
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,291
[KYON]
No way!

1014
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:09,708
Here's what you asked for.

1015
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,125
Thanks a lot for bringing it.
Mm-hm. It's all here.

1016
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,625
[KYON]
Hm?

1017
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:18,041
It's Mr. Arakawa. Oh, man.
What are these people up to now?

1018
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,791
[KOIZUMI]
Let's get changed, shall we?

1019
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,083
Uh? Okay.

1020
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,291
Wait. Changed into what?

1021
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,541
Why am I wearing this?

1022
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:25,791
It's the male escort look.

1023
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,125
Male escort?!

1024
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,958
Well, it's the first thing
that popped into my mind

1025
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:32,208
when I thought about someone
doing something for a woman.

1026
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,791
I don't know about this.

1027
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:36,416
What do you think, Miss Mori?
Do we look like male escorts?

1028
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,750
The suits are perfect,
but you still need to have that

1029
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:40,958
male escort smile
to complete the look.

1030
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,375
The what?

1031
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:44,833
Male escorts seduce women
with their killer smiles.

1032
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,833
[KYON] But... I don't
want to kill anyone.

1033
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:48,541
I have to be going now.

1034
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,458
Seeing as to how we
don't have any other ideas

1035
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,416
we might as well
give this one a try.

1036
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,250
What the heck, right?

1037
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,083
Okay. Here goes.

1038
00:45:58,375 --> 00:45:58,958
[ALL]
Huh?!

1039
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,458
Wussup ladies?

1040
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm just ya average charmer
and the name's Kyon. Holla.

1041
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:05,125
And I'm Itsuki,
the Crimson Super Ball.

1042
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:07,291
Guess why they
call me that? Holla.

1043
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,750
[screams]

1044
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,250
What's wrong with you idiots?!

1045
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:18,125
Get rid of those cheesy outfits!
You're making Mikuru cry!

1046
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:21,875
[TSURUYA humming]

1047
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:27,833
[TSURUYA]
This feeling... Who is that?

1048
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,000
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

1049
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:52,166
[HARUHI groaning]

1050
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,708
We better do somethin'
for Halloween.

1051
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:01,625
It's not as simple
as going to Kyoto.

1052
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:03,458
Do you know anything
about Halloween?

1053
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:05,625
Like what it's about, and
what you're supposed to do?

1054
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,041
Huh? Well, um...

1055
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,791
I guess you need to
have pumpkins and bats?

1056
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:12,916
Kyon's useless. What about
you, Koizumi. Do you know?

1057
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,208
It would be far more
interesting if I pretended

1058
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:18,125
not to know, so no.
I have absolutely no idea.

1059
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:20,541
Oh, darnnit. I guess you're
in the dark like the rest of us.

1060
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:21,833
Didn't you hear what he said?!

1061
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:23,708
Whatever. We'll just
make it up as we go.

1062
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:24,750
Hello!

1063
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,250
Let's do a little research.

1064
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:28,250
Yeah, but do you even
know where to start?

1065
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:30,583
[HARUHI] For now, this is all
the information we've got.

1066
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:33,000
[KYON] There are so many
things I could say right now...

1067
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,916
Okay... Let's do this.

1068
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,833
[BOTH]
Stare.

1069
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:39,375
A-ha!

1070
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,416
We need a guy wearing a cape
with a scary pumpkin on his head

1071
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,375
and a bunch of bats!

1072
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,750
I was thinking the same thing,

1073
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,916
but there's gotta be
more to it than that.

1074
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,500
--Look! We bought a pumpkin.
--[KYON panting] 

1075
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:49,875
[KYON]
I bought it.

1076
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,000
[HARUHI]
You ready?

1077
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:51,541
[KYON]
Hm?

1078
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:53,083
[HARUHI yells]

1079
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:55,875
Ah! What are you doing?!

1080
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:57,416
Carving a pumpkin's
a lot of work,

1081
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,416
so I thought we could just
press it against your face

1082
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,958
and make it--

1083
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:03,083
What are you crazy?! Do you know
how hard those things are?!

1084
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,291
[HARUHI] Mikuru, your job
is to carve out a face.

1085
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,375
Okay!

1086
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:07,666
[HARUHI]
And Yuki, you give her a hand.

1087
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,666
Understood.

1088
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,875
[HARUHI]
I'm gonna go out for a bit

1089
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:11,958
and pick up the rest
of the things we need.

1090
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:16,583
I finished carving the face.
What do you think?

1091
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:19,208
The right eye is three
millimeters larger.

1092
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:20,250
Ah...

1093
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:24,083
The left eye is one
millimeter larger now.

1094
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:25,416
Ah...

1095
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:29,208
The mouth is 1.5 millimeters
smaller on the right.

1096
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:32,291
The right eye is
.3 millimeters larger.

1097
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:36,125
[MIKURU]
Sniff.

1098
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,333
I have returned!

1099
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,583
I got pretty much
everything we need.

1100
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:42,958
Except the bats.
I couldn't find those.

1101
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,166
What's up, Haru-nyan?

1102
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,416
If you want bats,

1103
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,833
the cave behind my
house has a bunch of 'em.

1104
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:48,416
No way! Really?!

1105
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,416
[KYON] Where the heck did she
find that horrible thing?

1106
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,833
[KOIZUMI]
I have no idea...

1107
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:53,666
Perhaps she's planning
on putting the pumpkin

1108
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,250
and the cape on it.

1109
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:56,291
[KYON]
You're kidding.

1110
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:00,458
[KOIZUMI] He's looking quite
sinister now, don't you think?

1111
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,958
It's like a shrine
to some pagan god.

1112
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,458
Now I get it!

1113
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,750
If I knew you guys were
getting ready for Halloween,

1114
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,125
I would've brought some candy.

1115
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:09,166
Candy?

1116
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,083
That's what
Halloween's all about!

1117
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:13,541
Kids dress up in monster
costumes, go door-to-door,

1118
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:14,708
and you give them candy.

1119
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:17,333
Really?! So that's
what it's all about?

1120
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:20,000
My bad. I was going with the
idea that we had to make up

1121
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,291
an original god to worship
and give offerings to.

1122
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,583
You're kidding?!

1123
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,291
Oh, well. Let's offer
up some candy to it.

1124
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:27,875
Mikuru, do you have any candy?

1125
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:31,916
Huh?! Uh... Uh. Uh!

1126
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,375
This is all I had in my pocket.

1127
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,083
[HARUHI] I don't know if it
really counts as candy,

1128
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:37,375
but, whatever.

1129
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,875
Perfect!

1130
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:40,250
[KOIZUMI]
Trick, or treat?

1131
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:42,208
[KYON]
Search and destroy.

1132
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:43,458
We're done with it,

1133
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,333
so let's ditch this guy
in the Computer Club.

1134
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:49,291
[NAGATO]
I'm home.

1135
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:50,791
[ASAKURA]
Welcome back.

1136
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:53,625
I know you just came home,
but could we go to the market?

1137
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:55,958
We don't have
anything for dinner.

1138
00:49:57,416 --> 00:49:59,291
Oh, how I love it when
you put me in the bag.

1139
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:01,000
It's so warm and cozy.

1140
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,541
Don't put me in it!

1141
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:06,083
But if I run into that cat
again, I'll be unprotected.

1142
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:08,000
[ASAKURA groans]

1143
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:10,333
Here we are.

1144
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:12,250
We are, at that.

1145
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:15,333
Was there anything in particular
you wanted to have for dinner?

1146
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:18,208
I would like to have
rabbit roti with a renegade

1147
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:20,625
in a sherry glaze,
and a carrot puree.

1148
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:23,208
[ASAKURA] Oh, look. Potatoes
and carrots are cheap today!

1149
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:24,708
We could have curry.

1150
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,125
Five steps to the right!

1151
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,666
Fifty centimeters straight up!

1152
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,958
Steady now!

1153
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:31,291
Release the ingredients!

1154
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:35,291
Bon appetit. Dinner is served.

1156
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:44,333
[ASAKURA] Now that I'm teeny
tiny, I can't stay up late.

1157
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:47,333
You've got school
tomorrow, Miss Nagato.

Huh?

1168
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:40,083
Hey! Don't you know
how scary it is

1169
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:42,041
to have a balloon popped
that close to your face?!

1170
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,541
Whoa! A main character

1171
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:45,791
shouldn't make scary
faces like that, Kyon.

Here, take it.

You can try it on me,
if you want.

I'll hold the balloon this time.

are pretty fun,

1176

and they're super easy to use.

A-ha! That hurt!

1178
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:58,625
You got me between
the nose and lip!

00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:01,416
Gee. Sorry about that.
I guess it slipped.

I'm sorry, Mikuru.

I promise I'll never aim a

I swear it on Mikuru's grave.

Miss Asahina taught all of
us a valuable lesson today,

1196
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,375
but she paid the ultimate price.

1197
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:38,750
Thank you, Mikuru. Farewell.

1198
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:41,375
Um... Excuse me,
I'm still alive.

1199
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,208
[HARUHI] What are we going
to do about our duel?

1200
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:45,083
We can't just walk away from it.

1201
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:46,333
We can't use the blow guns,

1202
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:48,333
and we still have a
ton of balloons left.

1203
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:49,583
[KYON]
Hm...

1204
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,041
I know! We're gonna have
a balloon art contest.

1205
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:54,791
We can decorate Mikuru's
grave with our creations!

1206
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:56,166
Just what I was I thinking!

1207
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,416
Excuse me, I haven't
died yet. I'm alive.

1208
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,666
[KOIZUMI]
And just like that,

1209
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,500
the Asahina Cup Balloon
Art Contest is underway.

1210
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:04,916
Whoever makes the
best decorations

1211
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,208
on Miss Asahina's grave wins.

1212
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:09,791
Hello there, everyone.
I'm Red Balloon Koizumi,

1213
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:12,750
and I'll be judging and
providing the commentary today.

1214
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:19,583
Kyon, I always wanted to settle
things with you this way.

1215
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:21,375
Yeah, right. Dream on, buddy!

1216
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:24,708
I knew a day like this would
come around eventually.

1217
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:26,875
You know I'm totally
kidding though, right?

1218
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:30,416
Get ready, balloon
fighters... Go!

1219
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:35,416
Hm? What's that?

1220
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,541
It's, uh, lotus root.

1221
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:40,166
How 'bout yours?
It looks the same as mine.

1222
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,291
It's sort of a... chain mine.

1223
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:44,625
[BOTH]
I don't know how to do this!

1224
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,416
[HARUHI]
Whatever! We made them,

1225
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,416
so we might as well
use them to decorate.

1226
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,625
And Miss Suzumiya
just scored 10 points.

1227
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,791
[KYON] What?! She gets
10 points for that?!

1228
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:58,208
[KYON] Oh, well. We couldn't
really do anything creative.

1229
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:00,750
We just blew up balloons
and put twists in them.

1230
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:03,083
But we twisted and
blew the best we could.

1231
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:04,666
Yeah. We did, didn't we?

1232
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,708
And somewhere along the way we
stopped caring about the score.

1233
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,958
[HARUHI] This is boring.
Let's do somethin' else.

1234
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:11,625
[KYON]
Okay.

1235
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:12,916
[MIKURU whines]

1236
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:16,541
[HARUHI grunting]

1237

Rats.

1238
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:20,125
Sorry, Mikuru, but the
balloons are so tangled

1239
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:21,083
I can't get 'em off.

1240
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,250
Wha...?!

1241
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:24,083
[HARUHI] Don't worry!
I'll just pop 'em

1242
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:27,583
--and you'll be good to go!
--Hey, what's up Nagato?

1243
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:28,750
These things.

1244
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:30,333
Hm? Yeah.

1245
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:32,625
We got a lot of balloons
left over, huh?

1246
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:34,875
I wonder why Haruhi
bought so many.

1247
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:39,000
[HARUHI] Sorry, Mikuru, but I'm
the kind of woman who always

1248
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:40,250
gives in to her desires.

1249
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:41,708
May I have them?

1250
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:44,041
Yeah. Help yourself. You can
take as many as you want.

1251
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:45,666
--Thank you very much.

00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,458
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

1254
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:11,750
[HARUHI groaning]

1255
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,333
Oh!

1256
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:22,916
Huh?

1257
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,625
[laughing]

1258
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:26,875
Balloons are such powerful
things, aren't they?!

1259
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:28,291
[NAGATO]
I think not.

1260
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:30,500
However, it is my
understanding that one

1261
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:33,625
can create the likeness of both
animals and plants from them.

1262
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:36,083
[ASAKURA] Seriously?!
Balloons are awesome.

1263
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,875
They might be the predecessors
of artificial life.

1264
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:41,250
It's a form of humanoid
transmutation!

1265
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:44,291
I will now attempt to
create the likeness of a dog.

1266
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:45,666
Huh?

1267
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:49,333
Ah! Miss Nagato!
It's scary! Stop it!

1268
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:50,708
[NAGATO]
I'm done.

1269
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:53,458
The air inside has conformed
to the shape of a dog.

1270
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,041
It's cute. I'll give you that.

1271
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:58,625
But watching it transform has
left me with emotional scars.

1272
00:55:58,708 --> 00:55:59,750
[exhales]

1273
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,583
[ASAKURA]
Hm. It would be wonderful

1274
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:06,458
if this could move
around on its own.

1275
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:07,375
Understood.

1276
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:09,208
No! Stop it!

1277

[BALLOON DOG pants]

1278
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:12,708
[NAGATO]
I was able to make it move.

1279
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:15,291
Aw! So cute.

1280
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:19,958
Ah! Come back! [giggles]

1281
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,583
Fooled again!

1282
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,000
Okay, you win. I thought
I could be happy,

1283
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,500
and just play with the balloon
dog without having to worry

1284
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,583
about falling into
one of your traps.

1285
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:32,875
You should know better.

1286
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:35,500
I know I should, dammit!

1287
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,875
Do what you will, then.
Boil me. Roast me.

1288
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:40,083
Do what you want, I don't care.

1289
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,583
[BALLOON DOG] Aw, come on.
Don't let it get ya down.

1290
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,625
It can talk!

1291
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:47,125
[BALLOON DOG]
You can call me... Hm...

1292
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:49,666
Oh! How about Mr. Kimidori?

1293
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,875
It is the color of
my body, after all.

1294
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:54,916
[ASAKURA] I have to address a
balloon dog as "mister," now?

1295
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,375
Preparations complete.

1296
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,791
Wait. Preparations?

1297
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:58,916
There's so much happening,

1298
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,666
I don't know what's
going on anymore!

1299
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,625
Help! I'm floating!
Get me down from here!

1300
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:06,458
By injecting a gas into it
which is lighter than air,

1301
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:09,333
the balloon attains
the ability to float.

1302
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:11,125
[MR. KIMIDORI]
Interesting phenomenon.

1303
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:13,166
What kind of gas
did you put in it?

1304
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,125
[NAGATO]
I extracted hydrogen from water,

1305
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:16,458
and then I injec--

Here we g--!

[HARUHI groaning]

1308
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:52,708
Hi everyone!

1309
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,375
Drop what you're doin' and
grab those pots and pans,

1310
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:57,375
'cause it's time for "Haruhi
Suzumiya's Simple Cooking Show"!

1311
00:57:57,458 --> 00:57:59,083
Yay!

1312
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,083
The topic for today's
show is easy to make,

1313
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:03,833
super nutritious, healthy,
fresh, rich, simple,

1314
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:05,416
and inexpensive cooking!

1315
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,750
Wow... That sounds
ambitious and nutritious.

1316
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:12,000
For today's recipe, we're gonna
have to boil some instant ramen.

1317
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:14,541
Hey! Isn't this supposed
to be a healthy recipe?!

1318
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:17,000
But you'll have to
open the package first!

1319
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:18,250
Yuki!

1320
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:19,958
[KYON gasps]

1321
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,583
[KYON]
That was unnecessary.

1322
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:24,291
That was completely,
and totally, unnecessary.

1323
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,125
[HARUHI]
That sucks. It's all broken.

1324
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:28,958
Looks like damaged goods.

1325
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:30,583
[KYON] You know...
the thing with the katana

1326
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:31,916
could also be to blame.

1327
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,250
Oh, well. Whatever.

1328
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:34,458
We can just skip the step

1329
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:36,708
where Yuki chops it
all up into quarters.

1330
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:38,291
[KYON]
You were gonna throw it again?!

1331
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:40,583
Next, we place all
the pieces of ramen

1332
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:42,375
into a pot of boiling water.

1333
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:44,333
Then we're gonna let
it cook for 50 hours.

1334
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:47,333
What?! Cooking it for
50 hours isn't simple!

1335
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:48,458
Don't worry about it.

1336
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:50,375
I've got a batch of
it already cooked.

1337
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:51,875
It'll look simple
to the audience,

1338
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:53,375
but they'll never
know the truth.

1339
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:54,833
That's not the problem!

1340
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:57,625
[HARUHI] Mikuru! Bring the
you-know-what over here!

1341
00:58:57,708 --> 00:58:59,833
Oh! Okay!

1342
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:02,041
[grunts]

1343
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:04,125
[screams]

1344
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:08,375
[HARUHI] Okay. We're
just gonna move on...

1345
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:11,958
Miss Asahina. Duck down,
you're in the shot.

1346
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:13,666
[HARUHI]
We put the noodles in a bowl.

1347
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,083
Boiling them for 50 hours
has turned them all mushy,

1348
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,750
but here's the good thing!
Now they're easier to digest,

1349
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:20,541
so they're even better for you!

1350
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:22,250
So, hang on a sec...

1351
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:23,583
The noodles in that bowl were

1352
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:25,125
cooked the right
amount of time, but...

1353
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:27,375
Oh, never mind.
I get where this is going.

1354
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,625
[HARUHI]
Let's set this aside for now,

1355
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,625
and get ready to put on
the finishing touches!

1356
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:32,500
I don't know 'bout you,
but I'm tired.

1357
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:34,750
I'll be right back
after these commercials.

1358
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,583
Wait! We've got commercials?!

1359
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,166
[HARUHI]
You can do it!

1360
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:40,625
[KYON]
Hm?

1361
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:43,708
Hey, Nagato. What's up
with the katana anyway?

1362
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:45,166
I can explain that!

1363
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,291
Miss Suzumiya wanted a
really sharp kitchen knife

1364
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,500
to have on set today.

1365
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:50,291
So I got in touch
with my organization,

1366
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:51,541
and they gave me that.

1367
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:53,708
Uh! Are you trying to
get someone killed?!

1368
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,583
[chuckles]

1369
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:58,125
I've never handled a
real-life katana before.

1370
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:00,958
Now that I'm holding one, I sort
of feel like cutting something.

1371
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:02,458
If you don't mind,

1372
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:04,500
would you please point that
at someone else for a while?

1373
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:06,208
Homing mode has been activated.

1374
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:09,000
You are now able to cut
a target any way you wish.

1375
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:10,375
[KYON]
Yeah?

1376
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:11,791
[KOIZUMI] Why don't you try
carving a human figure

1377
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,291
out of this daikon?

1378
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:15,166
Okay. Here goes no--

1379
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,666
[KYON yelps]

1380
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,666
Carving a detailed form will
cause a great deal of stress

1381
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,083
on the wrists.

1382
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:23,166
It is very dangerous for
humans to use cutlery.

1383
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,916
[KOIZUMI]
Yes... Cutlery...

1384
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,416
His wrists were bending in
all sorts of interesting ways,

1385
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,750
weren't they?

1386
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,041
Can you handle it without
incident, Miss Nagato?

1387
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:32,083
[NAGATO]
Of course.

1388
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,166
I can carve miniture
figures out of anything.

1389
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,583
[KOIZUMI]
That's amazing.

1390
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:40,208
Okay! Here I go again.

1391
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:42,250
You don't know when
to give up, do you?

1392
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,416
Heh. After watching
Nagato do it,

1393
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,208
I figured out exactly where
I went wrong the last time.

1394
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:49,416
Okay, then.
If you really want to.

1395
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,000
[KYON]
You have to do the cutting

1396
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:53,083
while the target's
still in the--

1397
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:54,833
[screams]

1398
01:00:54,916 --> 01:00:56,625
--[screaming continues]
--[KOIZUMI] And he's spinning...

1399
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:58,208
[sighs]

1400
01:00:58,291 --> 01:01:01,083
Okay, we're back. So let's hurry
up and finish the soup already.

1401
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:02,291
[KYON]
She's bored...

1402
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:03,541
I got a bunch of healthy
lookin' things here,

1403
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:05,000
so I'm just gonna throw 'em in.

1404
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,500
That's too vague!

1405
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:08,666
Cover it up, and let the whole
thing cook for five days!

1406
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,041
Five days?!

1407
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,875
Okay, Mikuru. Try it again,
but without spilling!

1408
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:16,333
[MIKURU grunting]

1409
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,666
[MIKURU] The last time
I did this, I messed up.

1410
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,916
But this time, I'm going
to do my job properly!

1411
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,458
[KYON, HARUHI]
Uh?!

1412
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:25,500
[KYON, HARUHI sigh]

1413
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,916
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

1414
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,208
[HARUHI groaning]

1415
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:01,500
[MIKURU]
Oh...

1416
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:13,333
--[TSURUYA yells]
--[MIKURU screams]

1417
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:21,083
[HARUHI]
Hm... Cherry blossoms.

1418
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:24,375
Cherry blossom petals,
fluttering to the ground.

1419
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:25,083
Blood spraying.

1420
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:26,583
Uh?!

1421
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:30,458
[HARUHI] Digging a hole...
Burying. Under a cherry tree.

1422
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:32,791
I've got it!
A cherry blossom party!

1423
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,541
Okay. Let's talk
about how you went from

1424
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:35,625
what you were thinking just now

1425
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:37,708
to having a cherry
blossom party.

1426
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:38,875
[HARUHI sighs]

1427
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:41,000
You'll never go far
with that attitude.

1428
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:42,833
[KYON] Please don't
lecture me like that.

1429
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:44,500
I'm not your son.

1430
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:46,750
You'll always be a
subordinate Brigade member

1431
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:48,250
if you don't change your ways.

1432
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,500
Gotcha. I'm okay
with that though.

1433
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,500
Really, I am, Mother.

1434
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,791
I'm not your mother!
You wanna get smacked?!

1435
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:55,958
[KYON]
You already smacked me!

1436
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:57,708
Then I'm gonna call you father!

1437
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,166
What are you talking about?!
Calm down!

1438
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,708
[HARUHI]
You asked for it, Kyon!

1439
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:05,125
Now I'm gonna show you just
how incompetent you really are!

1440
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:06,708
Hey, Koizumi!

1441
01:03:06,791 --> 01:03:07,958
Did you call me?

1442
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,625
[HARUHI] Mm-hm. Could
you come here for a sec?

1443
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,333
This and that, and
that and this.

1444
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:14,166
And then, after all that, what
would your conclusion be?

1445
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,208
Cherry blossom party.

1446
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,375
That was fast!

1447
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:18,666
It wasn't terribly
hard to decipher it.

1448
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,000
[KYON]
Oh. Yeah?

1449
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,458
Well. How did I do?

1450
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:32,916
Awesome job, Number 2!

1451
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,041
I get it. You guys
are my enemies.

1452
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:37,625
Okay! Let's go have a
cherry blossom party!

1453
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,166
I refuse to go!

1454
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,208
Koizumi, do you know of any
good places where we could go

1455
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:42,541
for somethin' like this?

1456
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:44,708
[KYON] Aren't you even
gonna try to convince me?

1457
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:48,041
The thing is, anywhere we go
is probably gonna be crowded.

1458
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,791
It's unfortunate, but true.

1459
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:52,041
The best thing for us would
be if we could find a place

1460
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:53,250
that's privately owned.

1461
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:55,250
You can't dig holes
on private property.

1462
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:56,791
Wherever we go,

1463
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:59,333
we have to make sure digging
holes is okay with the owners.

1464
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:00,875
That's true.

1465
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:02,458
[KYON]
Just throwing this out there,

1466
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:05,958
but maybe the hole digging thing
isn't really all that important?

1467
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:08,541
[TSURUYA] Ha, ha. I heard what
you guys were talking about.

1468
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:10,791
[gasps] Hey, I know that voice.

1469
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:12,375
[KYON]
Tsuru-- Huh?

1470
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,250
[HARUHI]
Mikuru?

1471
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:14,250
[MIKURU]
Hm?

1472
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,291
Miss Tsuruya?!
Where did you go?!

1473
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:17,625
Don't disappear like that!

1474
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:20,125
She just was just here, I swear.

1475
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,625
[TSURUYA]
Ha, ha. Sorry about that.

1476
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:23,791
[KYON]
Uh?! Sneaky!

1477
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:25,583
I didn't mean to scare you.

1478
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:27,500
I'm training for an
upcoming battle, though,

1479
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,166
so I gotta stay sharp.

1480
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:32,000
Anyway, it sounds like you guys
are trying to find a good place

1481
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:34,166
to go look at cherry
blossoms, right?

1482
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,000
[HARUHI] And a place
where we can dig a hole.

1483
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:38,166
Then I've got the
perfect spot for you!

1484
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,541
It's in the cherry
blossom section of

1485
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,125
my private Tsuryua
Park Number 32.

1486
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:44,541
[KYON] Whoa! What
doesn't this girl have?!

1487
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:46,125
I like to keep it
on the down-low,

1488
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:48,708
'cause the place has sort
of a sinister past to it.

1489
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:50,833
You'll find something
if you dig deep enough.

1490
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:52,208
[KYON]
A sinister what?!

1491
01:04:52,291 --> 01:04:55,083
[HARUHI] Right on! We're
gonna go there this weekend!

1492
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:58,708
[ALL cheering]

1493
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:21,000
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

1494
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,291
[HARUHI groaning]

1495
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:27,166
[KYON grunts]

1496
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,125
[KYON sighs]

1497
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:30,166
Huh?

1498
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,416
[HARUHI] Okay, Kyon. This
spot feels weird enough.

1499
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,541
Start diggin'!

1500
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:35,916
[KYON]
It's gonna take forever.

1501
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,250
Would you relax? I can get
the others to come over

1502
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:40,708
and help you out, so you'll
be done before you know it.

1503
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:42,083
I think I get it.

1504
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,083
Basically, everyone
else digs and you don't.

1505
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:45,500
Yep! You know it.

1506
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:50,166
Well, she did get the others to
come over here, that's for sure.

1507
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,291
--But they're not much help.
--[GIRLS laughing]

1508
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:55,833
Haruhi's playing
mahjong with the guys.

1509
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:58,291
The girls go bored
and they came over.

1510
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:00,375
Geez. They're acting
like little kids!

1511
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:02,166
[MIKURU]
Hey, Kyon, look!

1512
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,041
We found something strange.

1513
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,083
[KYON]
Hm? Let's see.

1514
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:09,416
Wow. It's awfully pretty. I've
never seen anything like it.

1515
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,875
Maybe it's a jewel.

1516
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:12,791
[NAGATO]
It is not.

1517
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:14,208
That is no jewel.

1518
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:17,125
A subspecies of the Data
Integration Thought Entity

1519
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:18,416
lives within it.

1520
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,375
It coexists with the
cherry trees in this area.

1521
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:23,250
It clouds the mind of its prey,

1522
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:25,541
taking away its
ability to reason.

1523
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:27,916
It forces its prey
to stay in the area,

1524
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,041
taking care of the cherry trees.

1525
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:31,291
When the prey dies,

1526
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:34,166
it decays and becomes
nutrients for the tree.

1527
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:37,916
That is the reason why
this area has a sinister past.

1528
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,750
Heh! You must be kidding!

1529
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:41,958
Your story was so
long, I got lost!

1530
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,750
Me, too!

1531
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,000
Uh!

1532
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:51,833
Does anyone know what we
were just talking about?

1533
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:52,833
[NAGATO]
I do not.

1534
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:53,791
[HARUHI]
Mikuru!

1535
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,333
--[MIKURU] Huh?
--[KYON] Hm?

1536
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:58,250
I'm sorry, but Miss Suzumiya's
calling for us to come back.

1537
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,208
Are you going to
be okay if we go?

1538
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:03,041
Yeah, sure. If you guys get
bored hanging out with her,

1539
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:04,291
come on back.

1540
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,541
Well, here I am.

1541
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,041
Please tell me
you've got some idea

1542
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,833
about how to get
this digging done?

1543
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:15,833
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I've called in for some backup.

1544
01:07:17,791 --> 01:07:19,208
Uh!

1545
01:07:19,291 --> 01:07:21,541
I'm a taxi driver, just
passing through.

1546
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:22,833
Arakawa?!

1547
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:25,250
You were driving rather
frantically there.

1548
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,875
I hope that
everything's all right.

1549
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:29,750
Well, this is the
Tsuruya family's property.

1550
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:32,375
The security was
tighter than I expected.

1551
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:34,333
And, if my calculations
are correct,

1552
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:36,750
I can only stay about
three minutes or so.

1553
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:37,875
[KOIZUMI]
Hm.

1554
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:39,666
[KYON]
I'm totally lost.

1555
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:42,000
Three minutes should be
plenty of time for this!

1556
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:45,041
You're gonna make Mr. Arakawa
dig a hole in three minutes?!

1557
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:47,916
Not at all. In fact, I have
something else in mind.

1558
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,125
Look. See for yourself.

1559
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:55,791
[KYON]
A bomb?!

1560
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,291
Hello. I'm just a skydiver
who's passing through.

1561
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,458
Miss Mori?!

1562
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:08,041
I had no choice but
to crash-land here.

1563
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,666
And, silly me, I forgot
my parachute.

1564
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,750
You don't say? That's rather
clumsy of you, isn't it?

1565
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:15,250
[KYON]
Clumsy?!

1566
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:18,000
I wouldn't call skydiving
without a parachute "clumsy"!

1567
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:20,958
I happen to be a taxi driver.
I could give you give you a ride

1568
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:22,958
back to town in my
cab if you like.

1569
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:25,250
Actually, we're out
of time, so I insist.

1570
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:28,541
Why thank you. I can't
refuse an offer like that.

1571
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:30,291
It was nice meeting
you, gentlemen.

1572
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:31,750
I hate to crash
and run like this,

1573
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,916
but we really must be going.

1574
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:40,333
They leave a path of
destruction wherever they go.

1575
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:43,125
[KYON] What's up with you and
the corny action movie dialogue?

1576
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:44,500
And button your shirt!

1577
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,833
[HARUHI]
Kyon! We heard a big explosion!

1578
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:48,333
Did something happen?

1579
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:51,208
Whoa! Did you dig
this by yourself?

1580
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:53,041
Amazing job, Kyon!

1581
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:54,750
It's really amazing!

1582
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:56,875
Super amazing, Kyon!

1583
01:08:58,666 --> 01:09:01,791
[KYON]
Yeah... Well...

1584
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,375
Let's just say I
did it on my own.

1585
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:12,333
[TSURUYA]
Right. Sure.

1586
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:13,541
But that doesn't explain how

1587
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:15,791
they breached our
security so easily.

1588
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:17,125
[KYON]
Later, I heard Miss Tsuruya

1589
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,833
make an unsettling phone call.

1590
01:09:18,916 --> 01:09:20,000
To be continued...

1591
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:21,041
Wait! What?!

1592
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,291
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

1593
01:09:42,375 --> 01:09:43,625
[HARUHI groaning]

1594
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:50,125
Listen up!
We're gonna have ourselves

1595
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:51,541
a Christmas party today!

1596
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:53,916
Yay! Yay! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1597
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,041
[HARUHI]
Dumbass!

1598
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,000
You better take
this party seriously,

1599
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:00,166
'cause if you don't, they're
gonna come and kill us all!

1600
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,500
Who are you talking about?!

1601
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:03,708
[HARUHI]
I'm talking about people

1602
01:10:03,791 --> 01:10:05,375
who stalk rooftops at night.

1603
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:07,458
They carry sack full of
presents on their backs,

1604
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:10,083
and sneak in and out of houses
without anyone noticing

1605
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:11,541
they've been there.

1606
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:14,083
They're the elite members
of a mysterious organization

1607
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,791
who carry out their secret
mission once a year.

1608
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:18,000
Known as...

1609
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,458
...Santa Claus!

1610
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:21,375
--[MIKURU screams]
--The SOS Brigade is the only

1611
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:24,208
thing standing between them
and the unsuspecting public.

1612
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,416
Get ready, 'cause they're
coming for us tonight!

1613
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,000
You're kidding!

1614
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:30,833
The only chance we have beating
the threat know as Santa Claus

1615
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:33,125
is to have a full-proof
battle plan.

1616
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,791
So here it is, everyone!

1617
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:36,583
The Plan!

1618
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:38,500
First, we're gonna
throw him off our trail.

1619
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:41,000
We put up a sign in the window
of the Computer Club's room

1620
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,541
to make 'em think it's ours.

1621
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:45,333
Next, Kyon's gonna hide in
the room and wait by himself

1622
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:47,416
until the target shows up.

1623
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,041
The rest of us are gonna be
here in the SOS Brigade's room

1624
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,083
partying until we
run out of cake.

1625
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,666
We have to be careful though.

1626
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,666
If we get too loud, Santa might
here us and abort the mission.

1627
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:58,708
That is all.

1628
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:00,916
Any objections? Besides Kyon.

1629
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,500
[KYON]
I can't even object now?!

1630
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,166
We're gonna need all
the help we can get,

1631
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,708
so I got Miss Tsuruya
to give us a hand.

1632
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:09,000
Hi guys! Ready to party?!

1633
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:11,083
If we end up having a
show down with Santa,

1634
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,375
she's gonna step up and
turn the tables on him.

1635
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:15,375
[laughs] I can handle him!

1636
01:11:15,458 --> 01:11:18,750
I can't wait to practice my
fighting technique on that guy!

1637
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:21,791
I'm gonna become a master of the
Tsuruya-family Fighting Style

1638
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,041
when I turn 19!

1639
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,375
[KYON]
No way!

1640
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:26,541
[TSURUYA] What's up, Kyon?
Don't you believe me?

1641
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:29,833
I don't. It's pretty obvious
you made that last part up.

1642
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:32,041
[TSURUYA]
Okay then, take a look at this.

1643
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,375
[KYON]
What am I looking at?

1644
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:35,166
[TSURUYA] It's a picture
of when I fought a bear

1645
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,166
in the mountains.

1646
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,208
Wow! Cool!

1647
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:39,666
That's so fake!

1648
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:43,333
Perfect. Santa Claus
is gonna see this sign,

1649
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:45,625
think we're here, and come
right through this window.

1650
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:47,041
You sure that'll work?

1651
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:49,791
Now we just need to find a
good hiding place for you.

1652
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:50,833
A-ha!

1653
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:53,083
Here, put this on.

1654
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:54,958
I absolutely refuse!

1655
01:11:55,041 --> 01:11:57,375
Your refusal has been
refused! Put it on!

1656
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:58,875
[KYON]
You're evil.

1657
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:01,833
Come on. It's okay. Don't be
such a baby. Just put it on.

1658
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:03,333
You're gonna look great!

1659
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:05,041
I don't think I'm gonna
care how I look

1660
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:07,458
with that thing on my head.

1661
01:12:07,541 --> 01:12:09,000
[HARUHI laughing]

1662
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:11,000
[KYON]
I wanna die now...

1663
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:17,666
[TANIGUCHI sighs]

1664
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,916
I can't believe I made it

1665
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,666
all the way over here
without being spotted.

1666
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,875
I'm finally gonna be able
to get rid of this kappa.

1667
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:27,166
I picked the perfect
night to do this, too.

1668
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:30,500
No one's gonna suspect
it's me in the get-up.

1669
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:33,625
It's pretty risky with Suzumiya
and the others still here.

1670
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:35,333
Whatever.
Tonight's the night

1671
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:37,875
this freakin' kappa's
goin' home for good.

1672
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:40,208
All right. Here I go.

1673
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:42,375
[KYON sighs]

1674
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:45,875
I wonder if Santa's really
gonna show up tonight.

1675
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:49,458
I feel so stupid. Everyone's
next door having a good time.

1676
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:50,833
What the hell.

1677
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:53,333
But if I wasn't here, I'd be
home spending Christmas

1678
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:54,750
with my little sister.

1679
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:57,625
That wouldn't be
much fun, either.

1680
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:58,583
Huh?!

1681
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,375
Who... Wha... I...? Santa...?

1682
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:04,333
[TANIGUCHI whimpers]

1683
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:06,208
What is that?!

1684
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:07,208
[ALL]
Huh?

1685
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:08,666
What was that?!

1686
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,125
[TANIGUCHI whimpers]

1687
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,166
[HARUHI gasps]

1688
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:24,041
[HARUHI]
It's Santa!

1689
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:26,541
[TANIGUCHI]
Uh!

1690
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:31,458
[TANIGUCHI grunting]

1691
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:36,625
[KYON]
He's so big... and ran away.

1692
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:39,541
I think he's trying to find
a hiding place on campus.

1693
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,166
Come on, guys! Let's catch him!

1694
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:45,625
[KOIZUMI] Interesting. Miss
Suzumiya was picturing Santa

1695
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:49,541
to be this monstrous person,
so that's exactly what she got.

1696
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,750
Her power took what
was in her imagination,

1697
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:54,333
and transformed
Taniguchi's body.

1698
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,458
It's no use. I can't catch him.

1699
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:59,375
For a big guy,
he can really move.

1700
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:01,541
Hm. I know. But we
can slow down now

1701
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,125
'cause he's heading
right into my trap.

1702
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:04,375
What trap?!

1703
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:05,666
[KYON]
Miss Tsuruya!

1704
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,250
Like I said.

1705
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:09,708
Leave it to me.
I can handle this guy!

1706
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,916
[TANIGUCHI groaning]

1707
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:11,958
Now!

1708
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:16,416
[TANIGUCHI groans]

1709
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,291
Awesome job, Miss Tsuruya!

1710
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:19,625
And you, too, Yuki!

1711
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:22,291
[KYON] The Tsuruya-family
Fighting Style is real?

1712
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:23,666
[TANIGUCHI grunting]

1713
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:27,708
[HARUHI gasps] No... I can't
believe it. He's gone.

1714
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:30,208
He just left his clothes
behind and ran away.

1715
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:32,041
Was it safe to just let him go?

1716
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:35,625
I neutralized the changes Miss
Suzamiya made to Santa's body.

1717
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:38,208
[HARUHI whimpering]

1718
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:43,500
Come back, Santa! Don't go!

1719
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:49,208
[teeth chattering]

1720
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:52,750
O-Okay. So... why am I naked?

1721
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,750
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

1722
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:16,083
[HARUHI groaning]

1723
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:23,250
[door opens]

1724
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:25,666
I'm home.

1725
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:29,500
Oh, no. This is terrible.
Mr. Kimidori has gone flat.

1726
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:31,291
[MR. KIMIDORI]
It looks like the end for me.

1727
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:33,875
I'd like to be bury at sea,
if you don't mind.

1728
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:36,583
I cannot. If I threw a
balloon into the ocean,

1729
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:38,833
it would destroy
the environment.

1730
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,750
[ASAKURA] Miss Nagato didn't
believe any of it, did she?

1731
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:45,541
[MR. KIMIDORI] Well, our
acting could've been better.

1732
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,958
Anyway, would you please
blow me up again?

1733
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:49,083
[ASAKURA]
Okay.

1734
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,333
Mr. Kimidori pushed
me out of harm's way

1735
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:57,958
and got stuck under
the refrigerator!

1736
01:15:58,041 --> 01:15:59,500
[MR. KIMIDORI]
The light's fading...

1737
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:02,666
I want to be cremated and my
ashes scattered to the winds.

1738
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:06,291
I can't burn a balloon because
of the toxins it would release!

1739
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:11,333
[MR. KIMIDORI sighs]
We look pretty stupid right now.

1740
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:13,375
[ASAKURA]
Might as well give up, then.

1741
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:15,666
[MR. KIMIDORI] Would you please
pull out from under this thing?

1742
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,750
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course.

1743
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:19,833
[MR. KIMIDORI grunting]

1744
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:21,958
Uh-oh. I think you're
caught on something.

1745
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:24,041
I'm having a hard time
pulling you out.

1746
01:16:24,125 --> 01:16:25,208
Is something wrong?

1747
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:26,458
Yes, Miss Nagato.

1748
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:30,083
Mr. Kimidori is stuck
under the refrigerator.

1749
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:31,458
[ASAKURA]
Careful!

1750
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:33,833
If you pull too hard,
Mr. Kimidori is going to--

1751
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:36,666
[screams]

1752
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,000
[NAGATO]
Your dog is dead.

1753
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:40,166
Mr. Kimidori!

1754
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,375
It's all my fault!

1755
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:43,208
If it wasn't for this
April Fool's prank,

1756
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:46,791
he'd still be alive!
It's all my fault!

1757
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:49,416
[NAGATO] You shouldn't
blame yourself, little one.

1758
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,291
How dare you trick me?!

1759
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:18,833
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

1760
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:20,208
[HARUHI groaning]

1761
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:25,708
[HARUHI]
A live-action ESPer sentai show?

1762
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:28,125
Yeah! It's up on the
roof of Marutsuru,

1763
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,833
the store my family owns.

1764
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:31,208
I got a bunch of free tickets,

1765
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:33,166
so I thought you and the
others might like to go.

1766
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,000
Well, that's really nice of you.

1767
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:37,500
But I don't think I want
to see fake super-heroes.

1768
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:39,833
--But if they were real-- Ah!
--[NAGATO] We're going.

1769
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:44,000
Oh. Okay. If Yuki wants
to go, then I'm in, too.

1770
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,458
Let's all go together.

1771
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:46,500
[NAGATO]
Mm.

1772
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,333
[CROWD cheers]

1773
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:56,125
What's the deal with
all these people?

1774
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:58,791
Don't tell me you've
never heard about this.

1775
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,208
Every year,

1776
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:03,041
the folks at Marutsuru produce
an amazing sentai show.

1777
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,708
The fight scenes
are so incredible,

1778
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:06,625
everyone in Japan
knows about it.

1779
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,625
Every person here is
a fan of the show.

1780
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:10,583
Now I get it.

1781
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:12,791
That explains why the girls
are all in the front row

1782
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:14,541
being loud and annoying.

1783
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:15,875
Listen everyone!

1784
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:18,000
Our heroes can't defeat
the monster by themselves!

1785
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:21,083
I need your help to call the
only person who can save them.

1786
01:18:21,166 --> 01:18:22,208
All together!

1787
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:24,500
--Mustache Mask!
--[CROWD] Mustache Mask!

1788
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:26,916
They're heroes and they need
to ask the audience for help?!

1789
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,041
[HOST] I don't think
he heard you! Louder!

1790
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:31,625
I was gonna ask you this before,

1791
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:34,125
but why are you doing
a jigsaw puzzle here?

1792
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:36,458
Well, I knew we'd
have time to kill,

1793
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:39,208
so I brought it to
keep us occupied.

1794
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:41,791
[KYON] Two guys doing a
jigsaw puzzle on a Sunday?

1795
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:43,083
How depressing.

1796
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:44,250
And it's got roses on it.

1797
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,166
[KOIZUMI]
Hey. You're wokin' on it, too.

1798
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:49,791
Okay, monster.
Meet your newest opponent.

1799
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:52,333
Holy crap! That's Mr. Arakawa!

1800
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:55,458
Oh, look at that.
It is Mr. Arakawa.

1801
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:57,250
Oh, and the monster's Miss Mori.

1802
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,500
[KYON]
You're kidding?!

1803
01:18:58,583 --> 01:19:00,666
Is this another one of
their secret missions?!

1804
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:02,125
[MONSTER roars]

1805
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:03,083
Come on!

1806
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:03,958
[MONSTER roars]

1807
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:05,083
[ARAWAKA yells]

1808
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:09,625
[MIKURU] The other sentai
are just cheering him on.

1809
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:12,000
I wonder why they
don't help him.

1810
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:14,000
Miss Tsuruya, why
aren't the others...

1811
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,458
There it is again.

1812
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:16,708
That feeling...

1813
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:20,166
Miss Suzumi, why don't the--

1814
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:22,375
[HARUHI]
Yuki! Get down from there!

1815
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:26,166
You can't go on stage!
No! Come on!

1816
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,875
[MIKURU] I'll just stand
here and enjoy the show.

1817
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:32,083
That's it?

1818
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,333
Someone else does
all the fighting,

1819
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:34,625
but they get to kill it?

1820
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:36,333
They always seem
to get the good part.

1821
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:38,041
[HARUHI]
We're back!

1822
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:40,083
Man, that was so cool!
Wasn't it?

1823
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:42,583
You look like you were
really getting into to.

1824
01:19:42,666 --> 01:19:43,625
[HARUHI]
No, not really.

1825
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:45,875
I just came because
Yuki wanted to.

1826
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:47,291
Hey, could you watch my bag?

1827
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:48,625
I'm gonna go get an autograph.

1828
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:50,125
[KYON] Yeah.
You were definitely into it.

1829
01:19:50,208 --> 01:19:52,625
[HARUHI] Wait here for us.
We'll be back in a bit.

1830
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:54,166
[KYON]
Huh?!

1831
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,541
[MR. ARAKAWA]
Here you go, kid.

1832
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,291
I love you Mustache Mask!

1833
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,291
[HARUHI]
Darn it. We're last in line.

1834
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:02,375
Mustache Mask is
really popular, isn't he?

1835
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:03,416
Hm?

1836
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,125
Hey, I'll be back in just a sec.
I have to use the restroom.

1837
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:11,625
Okay. I'll get an autograph
for you if you're not back.

1838
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:14,875
[MIKURU] Aren't the restrooms
the other way though?

1839
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:24,333
I knew there was
something shady about you.

1840
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:28,208
Those weird vibes I felt
gave you away, nyoro.

1841
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:30,500
Now that we're here, we might
as well make the most of it,

1842
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:31,875
don't you think?

1843
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:36,125
Okay, get ready!
'Cause here I come!

1844
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:39,083
Don't hold back.
I need a good workout today.

1845
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:41,833
[TSURUYA]
Huh?

1846
01:20:41,916 --> 01:20:42,875
Uh!

1847
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:45,500
That didn't work...

1848
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:48,291
She can move pretty
fast in that costume.

1849
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:53,458
[TSURUYA] What's up? All
she does is dodge my attacks.

1850
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:55,791
She hasn't even
tried to fight back!

1851
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:57,666
I know.

1852
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,416
I'll try getting her
right when she lands.

1853
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,166
She won't even
know what hit her.

1854
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:05,875
And I'll keep hitting
her till she goes down!

1855
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:06,916
[grunts]

1856
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:13,041
[KOIZUMI]
This is amazing.

1857
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:15,083
I can't believe we're
almost finished with it.

1858
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:17,833
A hundred thousand
pieces is no joke.

1859
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:20,000
Okay. Are you ready to do this?

1860
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:23,833
Oh, yeah. We've come a long way,
and there's no turning back now.

1861
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:27,541
One more piece and this
puzzle is officially finished.

1862
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:29,208
Here goes.

1863
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:34,500
[BOTH laughing]

1864
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:41,083
Did I get her?

1865
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:42,375
Huh?

1866
01:21:42,458 --> 01:21:43,750
Where'd she go?

1867
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:45,708
[MORI] That was a wonderful
attack. I'm impressed.

1868
01:21:45,791 --> 01:21:46,916
[gasps]

1869
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,375
[MORI] I thought I could
take you on wearing

1870
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:49,791
that cumbersom outfit.

1871
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:52,583
But now that it's off,
I'm feeling much better.

1872
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:54,541
And since I'm in such
a good mood now,

1873
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:57,666
I'd like to give you
a piece of advice.

1874
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:58,916
Hey, little girl...

1875
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,333
Watch your back!

1876
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:09,416
Hey, we're back! Sorry
you had to wait so long.

1877
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,458
Uh?

1878
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:17,750
Hey, uh, Kyon... What's wrong?

1879
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,416
Koizumi?

1880
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:23,875
[MORI]
Hello, it's me.

1881
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25,916
I'm on my way back now.

1882
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,916
I hope you set my
lunch aside for me.

1883
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,208
I've worked up
quite an appetite.

1884
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:53,000
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

1885
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:54,541
[HARUHI groaning]

1886
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:01,083
Huh?

1887
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,500
[ASAKURA]
Ah!

1888
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:08,500
[MR. KIMIDORI chuckles]

1889
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:09,833
Guess who?

1890
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:11,541
I bet you're surprised to
see me floating around.

1891
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:13,541
[ASAKURA] Haven't you got
anything better to do?

1892
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:16,166
Why don't you help me
clean up around here?

1893
01:23:29,541 --> 01:23:30,541
Huh?

1894
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:33,083
Uh...

1895
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:35,000
Oh, seriously Miss Nagato.

1896
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:37,458
Pick up your stuff after you've
finished playing with it.

1897
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:38,916
[MR. KIMIDORI sighs]

1898
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:44,750
[ASAKURA]
Oh, look at that. All clean.

1899
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:47,666
Thank you so much for helping
me reach all the high places.

1900
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:49,750
I couldn't have
done it without you.

1901
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:53,541
Okay, everyone. Let's take a
break now and have some lunch.

1902
01:23:53,625 --> 01:23:56,125
Mr. Kimidori, would you
help me cook something?

1903
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:57,708
[MR. KIMIDORI]
You got it.

1904
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,250
Okay, time for
the salt and pepper.

1905
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,041
[MR. KIMIDORI]
Coming up.

1906
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:05,000
Why thank you, Mr. Kimidori.

1907
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,833
Having you around makes
the day go smooth.

1908
01:24:12,125 --> 01:24:14,208
[ASAKURA]
That's it! We're done.

1909
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:15,875
You don't know how
much I appreciate

1910
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:17,833
all the help you gave me today.

1911
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,083
Hm?

1912
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:21,333
I was going to ask you
earlier, Mr. Kimidori.

1913
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:23,541
Why are you inside that?

1914
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:27,541
You will understand
once you get into this.

1915
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:28,541
[ASAKURA]
Oh.

1916
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,666
[ASAKURA laughs]

1917
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:55,083
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

1918
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:56,625
[HARUHI groaning]

1919
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:04,458
[HARUHI]
Hi everyone!

1920
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:06,791
Thanks for tuning in to
another fun-filled episode

1921
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:10,166
of my talk show.
Haruhi Suzumiya's Room.

1922
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:12,375
Let's get things started
by introducing

1923
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:13,583
our guest today.

1924
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:15,958
Okay. He calls himself
a horrible virus.

1925
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,583
With contagious laughter.

1926
01:25:17,666 --> 01:25:18,791
Please meet Kyon.

1927
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:20,000
That's a lie!

1928
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:21,708
I'd never call myself
something like that!

1929
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:25,000
Whoa! He just got here,
and now he's tearing into me.

1930
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,458
What should I do? I can't
keep up with him!

1931
01:25:27,541 --> 01:25:30,291
You haven't got this whole
TV-hosting thing down yet.

1932
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,166
Yeah. I'll figure it out though.

1933
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:34,375
Miss Waitress.
Can we have two coffees?

1934
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:35,250
Okay.

1935
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:36,500
What's with the waitress?

1936
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:38,166
I thought this was
supposed to be your room.

1937
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,333
Let's get back to
the show or somethin'.

1938
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:41,625
[KYON]
You're too laid back.

1939
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:42,875
Very well, Kyon.

1940
01:25:42,958 --> 01:25:44,375
How 'bout we start the
ball rolling with a few

1941
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:45,708
hard-hitting questions?

1942
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:48,166
[KYON]
Okay. Shoot.

1943
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:53,875
I can't think of
anything to ask you.

1944
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:55,083
[KYON]
You're kidding!

1945
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:57,333
Pretend you never met me
before or something!

1946
01:25:57,416 --> 01:25:59,000
At least make some
kind of effort

1947
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:00,500
to ask me a question, woman!

1948
01:26:00,583 --> 01:26:03,833
The kids today have such short
fuses, don't they? Scary.

1949
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:05,041
[KYON]
Oh, come on.

1950
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:07,583
You're way scarier than I am.
Get serious.

1951
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:09,000
Okay, fine.

1952
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:11,541
I guess you're right,
I wasn't taking it seriously.

1953
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:13,833
I promise I'll be
serious from now on.

1954
01:26:13,916 --> 01:26:15,416
It's about time.
Let's do this.

1955
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,583
Okay! Here we go.

1956
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:18,458
I'm gonna take my
show so seriously,

1957
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:20,875
I won't let our guests
in a word in edgewise.

1958
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:23,333
Then it's not a talk show!
It's a monologue.

1959
01:26:23,416 --> 01:26:24,666
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

1960
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:26,583
Our next guest is a person
who's a very good friend

1961
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:27,791
of What's-his-name's,

1962
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:29,125
Miss Yuki Nagato!

1963
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:30,458
You haven't asked me anything

1964
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:32,041
and you're bringing
out another guest?!

1965
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:33,208
Hello.

1966
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,208
Okay, Yuki. Do you
have any interesting,

1967
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:37,916
gossip-y stories to tell
the audience about Kyon?

1968
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,625
Yes. I might.

1969
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:43,833
There really aren't any.

1970
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:45,375
[KYON]
Ha! I knew it!

1971
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:47,875
Kyon, you're the boring-est
guest I've ever had.

1972
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:49,875
[KYON]
Now you're blaming the guest?

1973
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:52,791
Okay, Kyon. Help us
out here and tell us a story.

1974
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:53,833
Just make somethin' up.

1975
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:56,666
It's up to me to do it?!
Let's see...

1976
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,166
Mikuru can't help you now,

1977
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,375
'cause it's the third time
we've done this window bit.

1978
01:27:00,458 --> 01:27:02,958
Okay! I'm sorry! I don't
have any stories to tell!

1979
01:27:03,041 --> 01:27:05,541
And stop eating!

1980
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:06,583
I didn't wanna go there,

1981
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:08,333
but I guess I don't
have a choice.

1982
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:10,250
I'll have to whip out
my secret weapon.

1983
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:11,875
Secret what?

1984
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:14,708
I've prepared a scenario
utilizing every contact

1985
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:16,833
in my wide-ranging
network of contacts.

1986
01:27:16,916 --> 01:27:19,333
[KYON] Things are gonna
get complicated now.

1987
01:27:19,416 --> 01:27:21,458
It's an amazing story about
a group of friends

1988
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:23,541
who are aliens, time
travelers, and ESPers.

1989
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:26,333
It's everything you could ever
possibly want in a show.

1990
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:28,750
Okay! Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

1991
01:27:28,833 --> 01:27:30,208
Good job, Number 2!

1992
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:32,083
[KOIZUMI]
Oh, I'm just happy to help.

1993
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:34,208
[KYON]
I live that story every day!

1994
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:36,666
Okay, Kyon. Go ahead
and pick a scenario.

1995
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:37,666
And don't peek!

1996
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:40,041
[KYON]
Just... pick one blind?

1997
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,458
Okay. This one.

1998
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,083
This has nothing to do with me!

1999
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:45,791
Yum.

2000
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:46,916
[KYON]
Stop eating!

2001
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:08,250
[HARUHI]
Here we g--!

2002
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:09,625
[HARUHI groans]

2003
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:19,583
[ASAKURA]
Oh, this rain!

2004
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:20,791
Getting laundry to dry

2005
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:23,250
in weather like this
is next to impossible!

2006
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,833
My street clothes are
never gonna dry out!

2007
01:28:25,916 --> 01:28:27,833
[MR. KIMIDORI] Aah, I was
wondering why you're

2008
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:29,875
wearing your school
uniform today.

2009
01:28:29,958 --> 01:28:31,291
What memories!

2010
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,958
The last time I wore it
seems like forever ago!

2011
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:36,791
I had a purpose back then,
a reason for being.

2012
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:38,208
I could reach door knobs.

2013
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:39,833
[MR. KIMIDORI]
Sorry, but you're turning this

2014
01:28:39,916 --> 01:28:41,458
into a flashback episode.

2015
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:42,458
Let's not go there.

2016
01:28:42,541 --> 01:28:43,750
[ASAKURA]
Come on, just this once!

2017
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:45,375
[MR. KIMIDORI]
Sorry, no.

2018
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:46,791
[NAGATO]
I'm home.

2019
01:28:46,875 --> 01:28:48,541
[ASAKURA] Whoa! What happened
to you, Miss Nagato?!

2020
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:50,250
[MR. KIMIDORI]
Yeah, you're drenched!

2021
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:54,083
[NAGATO] On my way home,
a car splashed water on me.

2022
01:28:54,166 --> 01:28:55,333
[NAGATO]
Ahh!

2023
01:28:55,416 --> 01:28:56,458
[MR. KIMIDORI]
That's terrible, Miss Nagato.

2024
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:57,708
You could've dodged
the water, though.

2025
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,125
Why didn't you?

2026
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:02,083
My priority was keeping my
laptop out of harm's way.

2027
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:03,083
[ASAKURA]
Get out of those wet clothes,

2028
01:29:03,166 --> 01:29:05,125
and a take a nice, hot shower.

2029
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:07,500
That was refreshing.

2030
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:08,833
[ASAKURA screams]

2031
01:29:08,916 --> 01:29:10,833
I'm sorry, Miss Nagato.

2032
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:14,000
I did laundry today and all
your clothes are still wet.

2033
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,125
[NAGATO]
Oh...

2034
01:29:15,208 --> 01:29:17,041
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

2035
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:18,250
[MR. KIMIDORI]
I know what you're up to.

2036
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:19,666
Very clever.

2037
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:20,833
[NAGATO]
Water balloon mode.

2038
01:29:20,916 --> 01:29:22,666
[ASAKURA screeches]

2039
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,958
[MR. KIMIDORI]
I can explain.

2040
01:29:24,041 --> 01:29:25,916
Water balloon mode
is a process where

2041
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,208
Miss Nagato collects all
the moisture in the air

2042
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:30,041
and transfers it into my body.

2043
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:32,208
Doing that will remove
the humidity from the air

2044
01:29:32,291 --> 01:29:34,583
and the clothes will
dry more quickly!

2045
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:37,541
And I get to transform
into the giant ultra-dog

2046
01:29:37,625 --> 01:29:39,125
I've always wanted to be!

2047
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:41,833
[ASAKURA] I hate to say this,
but you just got fatter is all.

2048
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:44,458
And be careful, don't get
too excited or else--

2049
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:45,291
[MR. KIMIDORI screams]

2050
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:46,416
[ASAKURA]
I told you so!

2051
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,583
[MR. KIMIDORI]
I know... Sorry.

2052
01:29:53,083 --> 01:29:54,083
[ASAKURA sighs]

2053
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:57,583
[ASAKURA]
Aw...

2054
01:29:57,666 --> 01:29:59,666
This is so boring!

2055
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,458
After we finish all the chores,

2056
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:03,750
there's nothing to do except
wait for Miss Nagato

2057
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:05,625
to come home.
I hate to complain,

2058
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:08,666
but I wish we had something
to entertain ourselves with.

2059
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:10,875
[MR. KIMIDORI] If we could
go outside by ourselves,

2060
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:12,833
we wouldn't have this problem.

2061
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:13,583
Huh?

2062
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:14,458
[ASAKURA]
Hm?

2063
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:15,958
Is everything okay?

2064
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:18,708
[MR. KIMIDORI]
I just remembered something.

2065
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:22,541
[NAGATO] If the two of
you get bored, open this.

2066
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,750
[MR. KIMIDORI] That's what
she said, and she gave me this.

2067
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:27,416
Uh-huh... A mysterious box.

2068
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:28,708
[MR. KIMIDORI]
Correct.

2069
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:30,708
You know there's something
totally suspicious

2070
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:32,041
about this thing.

2071
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:34,083
[MR. KIMIDORI] Whatever.
We might as well open it.

2072
01:30:34,166 --> 01:30:35,250
Be careful!

2073
01:30:35,333 --> 01:30:36,375
--[MR. KIMIDORI screams]

2075
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:43,125
[MR. KIMIDORI]
Um...

2076
01:30:43,208 --> 01:30:45,250
I'm hearing a beeping
sound coming from it.

2077
01:30:45,333 --> 01:30:47,333
Is this thing what
I think it is?

2078
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:48,875
[laughs nervously]

2079
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:50,083
No way.

2080
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:52,791
[MR. KIMIDORI]
Mm-hm?

2081
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:55,583
That's your typical two-wire
scenario and a pair of scissors.

2082
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:57,541
[ASAKURA whimpers]

2083
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,500
Oh, I get it.

2084
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:02,250
To disarm it, I'm gonna
have to use these scissors

2085
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:03,916
to cut one of the wires.

2086
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,625
[MR. KIMIDORI]
Uh. Good guess.

2087
01:31:05,708 --> 01:31:07,000
This is fake.

2088
01:31:07,083 --> 01:31:09,458
Nothing's gonna happen to us
if I cut the wrong wire.

2089
01:31:09,541 --> 01:31:12,250
[MR. KIMIDORI] Uh, yeah... It's
just a toy to keep us occupied.

2090
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:13,458
It can't be real.

2091
01:31:13,541 --> 01:31:15,416
I mean, she wouldn't
do something like that.

2092
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,791
[BOTH laugh]

2093
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:21,333
It really looks like
a real bomb though!

2094
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:22,750
[MR. KIMIDORI cries]

2095
01:31:22,833 --> 01:31:23,708
[MR. KIMIDORI]
If this thing explodes,

2096
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:24,958
I don't want you getting hurt.

2097
01:31:25,041 --> 01:31:26,916
There's only one
thing for me to do.

2098
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,541
[ASAKURA] Mr. Kimidori,
what are you doing?!

2099
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:31,083
[MR. KIMIDORI] If anyone's gonna
get blown up, it's gonna be me!

2100
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:33,750
[ASAKURA] No, Mr. Kimidori!
I don't want that!

2101
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:35,541
Come back here!

2102
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:40,583
[ASAKURA crying]

2103

2104

[ASAKURA laughs]

2107
01:31:49,166 --> 01:31:50,541
Come back!

2108
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:52,708
[MR. KIMIDORI] Aw, come on.
Don't let it getcha down.

2109
01:31:52,791 --> 01:31:57,000
How about Mr. Kimidori? It is
the color of my body, after all.

2110
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:58,541
The light's fading...

2111
01:31:58,625 --> 01:32:01,958
I want to be cremated and my
ashes scattered to the wind.

2112
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:03,875
[chuckles] Guess who?

2113
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:05,875
I bet you're
surprised to see me.

2114
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:08,000
Okay, time for
the salt and pepper.

2115
01:32:08,083 --> 01:32:10,208
[MR. KIMIDORI]
Coming up.

2116
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:13,250
Miss Asakura... Farewell.

2117
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:17,708
[ASAKURA screams]

2118
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:24,333
I am home.

2119
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:25,791
[ASAKURA]
Oh! You're back!

2120
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:28,750
[BOTH]
Welcome home, Miss Nagato!

2121
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:30,000
Why is he burnt?

2122
01:32:30,083 --> 01:32:31,250
We were sorta bored,

2123
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:33,791
so we pretended we were
a bomb disposal unit.

2124
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:36,750
[MR. KIMIDORI] My performance
was more method than usual.

2125
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,375
[BOTH groan]

2126
01:34:35,458 --> 01:34:36,458
[KYON]
Okay...

2127
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:38,916
What the hell was that?

2128
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,791
[HARUHI]
When's it gonna stop?

2129
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:42,625
It sucks when it
keeps raining like this

2130
01:34:42,708 --> 01:34:44,333
because we can't go outside.

2131
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:45,333
Right, Mikuru?

2132
01:34:45,416 --> 01:34:46,875
You have a point there.

2133
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:48,041
Even when it's not raining,

2134
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:49,875
we're always
hanging out in here.

2135
01:34:49,958 --> 01:34:51,625
[HARUHI]
Really? No, we don't.

2136
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:53,333
[KYON] We spend more
than half of our time

2137
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:55,041
in this room, playing games.

2138
01:34:55,125 --> 01:34:56,291
[HARUHI]
Hmm...

2139
01:34:56,375 --> 01:34:58,666
But there's a different
reason for that, Kyon.

2140
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:01,375
When the weather's nice, we
could go outdoors if we wanted!

2141
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:03,375
But we stay inside
'cause we choose to!

2142
01:35:03,458 --> 01:35:05,000
[KYON]
She's hopeless!

2143
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:06,583
[HARUHI]
I know...

2144
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:09,750
We're gonna come up with some
new ideas for outfits to wear!

2145
01:35:09,833 --> 01:35:11,041
[KYON]
First, why?

2146
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:13,291
Second, what're you
gonna make us wear?

2147
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,916
I wasn't talking about us.

2148
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,333
We're brainstorming
costumes for Mikuru!

[HARUHI] We're gonna use
this board for our designs.

2153
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:29,333
First, I'm gonna sketch a
template version of Mikuru.

2154
01:35:29,416 --> 01:35:32,500
Oh, I get it. Then we
draw our designs on top.

2156
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:35,000
Is that her?

I guess...

2158
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:37,916
I was drawing her from memory.

2159
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,958
I don't know why it
came out like that.

2160

You don't have to
use your memory

2161
01:35:41,416 --> 01:35:43,375
when your subject's hanging
right in front of you.

2162
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:46,000

I'll look at her and draw.

Whoa!

2172
01:36:01,166 --> 01:36:03,000
Looks like something
interesting's going on!

2173
01:36:03,083 --> 01:36:05,166
Could I borrow your
notes from maths class?

2174

[MIKURU]
Sure.

2175
01:36:06,458 --> 01:36:08,333
I'd get them, but I
can't move right now.

so help yourself.

to be like that!

Hi, Miss Tsuruya.
Good timing.

2184

We got stuck.
We need you!

2185
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:25,541
I went off on a tangent,

2186
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:27,833
and sort of forgot
what we were doing.

to make a monster movie?

but that's a good idea!

second movie a monster movie!

getting a new outfit.

cool idea for a project!

2197
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:50,458
Tell you what,
guys, count me in!

2198
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:52,958
This is gonna be
so awesome now!

2199
01:36:53,041 --> 01:36:54,375
Watch a learn!

2200
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:56,708
My Tsuruya-style portrait
technique is so realistic,

2201
01:36:56,791 --> 01:36:58,541
it's like you're looking
at a photograph!

2202
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:01,250
Stand back 'cause it's time
to do some drawing!

2203
01:37:01,333 --> 01:37:02,208
Hya!

2204
01:37:02,291 --> 01:37:04,166
Hah!

2205
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,208
[BOTH gasp]

2206
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:12,875
[ALL]
Uh...

2207
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,666
[KYON]
You gotta be kidding.

2208
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:16,916
[TSURUYA]
Huh?

2209
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,916
[NAGATO] This room is currently
under the influence

2210
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,041
of Haruhi Suzumiya's powers.

2211
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:23,541
Therefore, any attempt
at accurate reproduction

2212
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:26,375
using artistic techniques
has been neutralized.

2213
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:27,625
[KYON]
Um...

2214
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:29,125
This drawing stuff
isn't really working out,

2215
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:31,875
so maybe we should quit for now.

2216
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:33,291
Yeah, you got a point there.

2217
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:35,666
You're right. We should
try doin' somethin' else.

2218
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:37,416
Something else like what?

2219
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,750
Miss Tsuruya? You know, right?

2220
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:42,250
[TSURUYA chuckles] Time to
break out our bag of tricks.

2221
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:43,500
[BOTH laugh]

2222
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:44,500
[MIKURU gasps]

2223
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:46,666
Stay away!
You both look so evil!

2224
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:49,166
[MIKURU screams]

2225
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:50,166
[HARUHI]
All done!

2226
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:52,041
[TSURUYA]
Yup! She looks awesome!

2227
01:37:52,125 --> 01:37:53,458
[BOTH]
It's her new monster costume!

2228
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:54,750
I freaking knew it!

2229
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:56,875
We were supposed to
make a new outfit for her!

2230
01:37:56,958 --> 01:37:58,291
[BOTH]
Oh...

2231
01:37:58,375 --> 01:37:59,958
[BOTH] It's her new outfit!
What do you think?

2232
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,041
[KYON]
You just rephrased it!

2233
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,041
That's still a
monster movie costume!

2234
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:05,166
Now all she needs is
a monster to fight!

2235
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:07,208
Have you done any
casting for it?

2236
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:08,375
Not yet.

2237
01:38:08,458 --> 01:38:10,791
I wonder who could
play the rival monster.

2238
01:38:10,875 --> 01:38:12,500
[HARUHI gasps]
You wanna do it, Yuki?

2239
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:13,875
Absolutely.

2240
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:15,875
Don't you even wanna
think about it first?

2241
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:18,333
I absolutely want to do it.

2242
01:38:18,416 --> 01:38:20,791
Remember, I have
done this before.

2243
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:22,000
[KYON]
Oh, yeah.

2244
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:24,000
I have to prepare for battle!

2245
01:38:24,083 --> 01:38:27,208
[KYON]
S-Sure. Break a leg.

2246
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:31,750
[NAGATO roars]

2247
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:35,625
--[MIKURU screams]
--[HARUHI laughing]

2248
01:38:40,625 --> 01:38:43,250
[KYON]
Hm? Are you okay over there?

2249
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:46,083
You didn't get involved in
any of today's craziness.

2250
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:49,541
Huh? Oh, that's right.
I didn't, did I?

2251
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:51,083
I'm sorry about that.

2252
01:38:51,166 --> 01:38:53,666
My mind was a million
miles away this whole time.

2253
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:54,875
[KYON]
Hm?

2254
01:38:54,958 --> 01:38:56,916
Okay, but you really
don't need to apologize.

2255
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,458
Don't tell me it's Haruhi again.

2256
01:38:58,541 --> 01:39:00,708
Is she causing more
weirdness to happen?

2257
01:39:00,791 --> 01:39:04,833
No... This doesn't have anything
to do with Miss Suzumiya.

2258
01:39:04,916 --> 01:39:07,208
But... It's just that...

2259
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:08,708
I guess if I told you,

2260
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:11,958
it wouldn't be such
a bad thing, after all.

2261
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:13,916
[KYON]
Huh?

2262
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,083
[thunder crash]

2263
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:16,666
[KOIZUMI] At the beginning
of this episode,

2264
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:20,083
the caption said ten heroines,
but we only saw eight of them!

2265
01:39:20,166 --> 01:39:22,583
Could I be one of the
two remaining heroines?!

2266
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:24,250
[KYON]
You gotta be kidding me!

2267
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:26,458
Is that what you've been
thinking about this whole time?!

2268
01:39:26,541 --> 01:39:27,666
Wait! I got it now!

2269
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:29,625
The other heroine can only be...

2270
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:31,166
...Mr. Arakawa!

2271
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:35,166
I don't freaking care!

2272
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:38,166
--It's ready!
--You made it?!

2273
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:39,708
I want you to test it.

2274
01:39:39,791 --> 01:39:42,333
Okay, if you insist...

2275
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:45,875
[KYON]
This is from the movie!

2276
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:51,208
[KYON]
Hmm... The Asakura route, huh?

2277
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:53,541
[NAGATO]
She is difficult to complete.

2278
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:54,916
If you make one wrong choice,

2279
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,458
you will arrive
at the bad ending.

2280
01:39:57,541 --> 01:39:58,791
[KYON]
This is too hard!

2281
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:00,666
By the way, this
type of character is

2282
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:03,291
more commonly known as yandare.

2283
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:05,333
[KYON]
This is getting a little creepy.

2284
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,875
[KYON] Okay...
I've seen this setup before.

2285
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:15,708
Do you consider this type
of meeting scenario boring?

2286
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:17,666
[KYON] That's an accident
not a meeting!

2287
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:20,583
Wait, is this the Arakawa route?

2288
01:40:20,666 --> 01:40:22,791
Oh, you got Miss Mori
as a P.E. teacher.

2289
01:40:22,875 --> 01:40:24,208
[NAGATO]
Yes.

2290
01:40:24,291 --> 01:40:26,708
If you complete her stage,
she will become your maid.

2291
01:40:26,791 --> 01:40:29,875
[KYON] Okay... That's kinda
strange, but I can live with it.

2292
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:32,750
And if you can make it to
the final stage and defeat her,

2293
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:35,041
you will be rewarded
with a happy ending.

2294
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:39,291
What in the name of all that's
holy is this game's genre?!

2295
01:40:39,375 --> 01:40:40,833
[NAGATO]
A love story?

2296
01:40:40,916 --> 01:40:44,041
But all I've been seeing is
a lotta fighting and bloodshed.

2297
01:41:00,583 --> 01:41:05,500
[chomping]

2298
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:12,500
Here we go!

Hey, Kyon! Hey, Kyon!

2306
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:35,875
Do you have any smoked
cheese with you?

2307
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:38,041
You already had some today.

I was wondering, do you know
how smoked cheese is made?

2318
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,875
Google it.

about smoked cheese?

to put out the fire.

Where's Miss Churuya?

2348
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:39,208
She didn't make it out in time.

2349
01:43:39,291 --> 01:43:40,833
Then she's dead.

Squeak... Hi.

2716
02:04:05,708 --> 02:04:09,708
Sneak... sneak... sneak...

2717
02:04:09,791 --> 02:04:11,833
You don't wanna go
there, Mr. Mouse.

2718
02:04:11,916 --> 02:04:13,125
[MOUSE]
Oh!

2719
02:04:13,208 --> 02:04:14,166

[SHAMISEN]
Ooh, smochee...

2723
02:04:19,541 --> 02:04:21,958
Christmas presents don't
have to be from Santa.

2724
02:04:22,041 --> 02:04:24,750
Anyone can give them
to people they like.

2725
02:04:24,833 --> 02:04:26,708
Hey, Kyon, lookit.

2726
02:04:26,791 --> 02:04:29,000
I got you a Christmas present.

2727
02:04:29,083 --> 02:04:33,416
I guess... Maybe now, you'll
have an idea about how much I...

2728
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:36,791
...really... really like you!

2729
02:04:36,875 --> 02:04:37,875
Gee, thanks.

2730
02:04:37,958 --> 02:04:39,375
How much you pay for it?

2731
02:04:39,458 --> 02:04:40,791
[ASHAKURA]
What?!

2732

[CHURUYA]
Nyoron...

2736
02:05:15,416 --> 02:05:17,875
Sledding is so much fun!

2737
02:05:19,375 --> 02:05:20,541
[CHURUYA screams]

2738
02:05:21,541 --> 02:05:23,333
[CHURUYA]
Nyoron...

2739
02:05:25,458 --> 02:05:29,041
I hope the vacuum doesn't
suck me up again, dusty.

2740
02:05:29,125 --> 02:05:31,375
You have nothing to fear, dusty.

2741
02:05:31,458 --> 02:05:34,250
I will protect you
no matter what, dusty.

2742
02:05:34,333 --> 02:05:37,041
--[CHURUYA] Gotcha!
--[BOTH] Dusty!

2743
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:39,958
Hey, Kyon! Hey, Kyon!

2744
02:05:40,041 --> 02:05:43,250
May I please have
your second button?

2745
02:05:43,333 --> 02:05:45,041

[CHURUYA]
Nyoron...

2747
02:05:47,916 --> 02:05:51,083
I don't want you hanging
around Kyon any longer!

2748
02:05:51,166 --> 02:05:54,208
I just wanna eat smoked
cheese with everyone!

2749
02:05:54,291 --> 02:05:56,291
You wanna have a
sleepover tonight?

2750
02:05:56,375 --> 02:05:58,833
Really? A sleepover at Kyon's?

2751
02:05:58,916 --> 02:06:01,000
[snoring]

2752
02:06:01,083 --> 02:06:04,250
[KYON]
Okay... This is weird.

2753
02:06:08,583 --> 02:06:10,208

2754
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,375
[ALL]
We love smochee...

2755

[ALL]
We love smochee.

2756
02:06:25,208 --> 02:06:30,458
I'm sorry, but I just can't
seem to find the smochee.

2757
02:06:30,541 --> 02:06:33,750
Today is Smochee Day, nyoro!

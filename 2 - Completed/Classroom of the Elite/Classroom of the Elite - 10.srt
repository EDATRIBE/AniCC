1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:15,375
[bell ringing]

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,958
[footsteps]

3
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,541
[MAN 10A]
Kiyotaka.

4
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,291
[MAN 10A] No matter what,
you must always remember this.

5
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:59,166
To have great power and refuse
to use it to your advantage

6
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,666
is something only
a fool would do.

7
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,541
[IKE]
Hey!

8
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,083
Check out all the
fish we caught!

9
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,833
And look at all this delicious
fruit that we picked!

10
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,833
Nice work! You guys are awesome.

11
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,583
[KEN] Okay, Hirata, what do
you want us to do next?

12
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,500
If you two wouldn't mind
getting the fire started,

13
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,833
that would be really helpful.

14
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,916
[KEN, IKE]
Sure!

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,166
Kushida, I'd like
you and your group

16
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,708
to oversee meal rations.

17
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,083
[KIKYO]
Right!

18
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,291
[HIRATA] Anyone else who
isn't busy can come help us

19
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,041
collect drinking water.

20
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,083
All right, then!

21
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,208
Can you help me carry these?

22
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,916
Oh! Okay!

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,958
[AYANOKOJI]
Yosuke Hirata.

24
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,375
Class D's unofficial
leader. Huh.

25
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,416
[SUZUNE] It's unusual to see
you take initiative like this.

26
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm almost suspicious.

27
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,166
I have nothing better to do.

28
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,875
It helps pass the time.

29
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,166
I don't mind doing recon,
but I don't wanna

30
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,375
burn undue calories
I could store.

31
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,625
Stamina is valuable
on a desert island.

32
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,166
So, I don't like
wandering around

33
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,875
without a clear goal in mind.

34
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,500
I understand that logic.

35
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,708
But on the flip side,

36
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,875
staying cooped up
does us no good.

37
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,500
And, besides...

38
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,000
Next time, I'll deal
with you personally.

39
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,625
I'm so looking forward to it.

40
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,416
It's clear that Class C has
put a target on your back.

41
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,666
We've gotta be
vigilant about this.

42
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,416
[sighs] Yeah, that's true.

43
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,333
I know!

44
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,958
This is amazing!

45
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,375
[ICHINOSE] There's so much
fruit in the forest,

46
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,083
it's almost like
someone planted it!

47
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,541
But if we need to, we can
go fishing right here!

48
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,166
And the waterfalls provide
all our fresh water!

49
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,375
Looks like Class B
hit the jack pot.

50
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,791
You're all incredibly
disciplined. I'm impressed.

51
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,375
[laughs] It was
pretty hard at first.

52
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:39,041
But we rigged some things up,
and it's really worked out!

53
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,375
Ichinose.

54
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,666
Is it safe to assume that
Class B can be trusted

55
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,250
to cooperate with Class D?

56
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,583
[ICHINOSE] Mm-hm. That's
definitely how I see it.

57
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,125
[KANEDA]
Sorry to interrupt.

58
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,458
How can I help you?

59
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,291
Oh, I was wondering
if there was anything

60
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,583
you'd like me to do to help out.

61
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,791
Well, why not join
Chihiro and the others

62
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,583
to see if there's
anything they need?

63
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,541
I'd be happy to.
Thank you very much.

64
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,083
He strikes me as a bit
distant for someone

65
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,291
who's in your class.

66
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,708
[ICHINOSE] Oh, he's not.
His name is Kaneda.

67
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,500
He got driven out of Class C
because of some falling out.

68
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,625
So, he asked to join
our camp, instead.

69
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,083
Oh, sorry.

70
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,333
I'd love to chat more,
but there's more work to do!

71
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,291
Come visit again soon, okay?

72
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,166
As much as you know
I hate to admit this,

73
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,500
this is way better
than our spot.

74
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,375
I can't see inside.

75
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,500
There's a curtain over
the opening of the cave.

76
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,875
[AYANOKOJI]
Let's check it out.

77
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,083
What are you doing?

78
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,000
There's no reason to be
intimidated by them

79
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,750
just because they're Class A.

80
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,541
What are you trying to achieve?

81
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,500
We don't stand to gain anything
by revealing our presence.

82
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,875
[AYANOKOJI]
Skulking around in the bushes

83
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,458
won't get us anywhere, either.

84
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,208
Might as well see what happens.

85
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,750
[grunts]

86
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,291
[YAHIKO]
What do you want?

87
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,083
[SUZUNE]
We came to scout your spot.

88
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,583
You got a problem with that?

89
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,125
Huh?

90
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,666
How very underhanded.

91
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,875
We're coming in.

92
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,958
[YAHIKO]
Hey!

93
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,000
What?

94
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,291
This place is
property of Class A.

95
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,083
You don't get to see it.

96
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,458
Oh?

97
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,416
Are you saying you've taken
possession of this spot?

98
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
That's right. Go away.

99
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry, is there some
rule I'm not aware of

100
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,416
that states I can't
enter this cave?

101
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,166
I can't officially use
an occupied spot,

102
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,708
but no one ever said
I couldn't look inside.

103
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,625
That would be considered
monopolizing this space.

104
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,333
I think you're
breaking the rules.

105
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,416
So let me have a look, okay?

106
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,375
[KATSURAGI] What do you
think you're doing?

107
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,083
Katsuragi!

108
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,625
I don't recall
giving you permission

109
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,958
to invite your friends.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Look, I only wanna
see what's inside.

111
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,625
I can't imagine that
being against the rules.

112
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,125
Well, go ahead and have
a look inside, then.

113
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,416
But, be prepared
for the consequences.

114
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,166
Each class chooses to occupy
one spot on the island,

115
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,541
and they must defend that spot
until the test is over.

116
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,750
If you decide to break
this unwritten rule,

117
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,125
then that will mean war.

118
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,708
You'd be better off to avoid
that kind of trouble.

119
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,458
I think you need
to reapply sunscreen.

120
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,750
[STUDENT 10G]
One, two, three, you're gone!

121
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,583
You've got to be kidding me.

122
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,000
What in the world does
Class C think they're doing?

123
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,416
[KOMIYA]
Um.

124
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,708
Ryuen wants to talk to you guys.

125
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,333
[RYUEN]
Hey, there.

126
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,583
You all seem to be
living the high life.

127
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,875
[RYUEN]
Oh, we are doing exactly that.

128
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,541
It's our summer
vacation, after all.

129
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,375
Why shouldn't we enjoy it?

130
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,083
Right?

131
00:07:59,166 --> 00:07:59,791
[GROUP]
Uh--

132
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,083
That's right!

133
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,875
[SUZUNE] An incompetent
leader only ends up

134
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,041
hurting his subjects.

135
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,583
Ishizaki.

136
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,166
[ISHIZAKI]
Yes, sir?

137
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,666
[RYUEN]
It's warm.

138
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,541
I'm very sorry, sir.

139
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,333
[RYUEN] For a measly one
or 200 class points.

140
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,208
The rest of you are willing
to endure starvation,

141
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,416
heat, exhaustion.

142
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,625
[RYUEN] The very thought
of it makes me wanna laugh.

143
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,291
I was dumb to come
here with my guard up

144
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,000
against a fool like you.

145
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:33,250
[RYUEN] Who's the real
fool here? Is it me?

146
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,958
Or is it you?

147
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,708
Ryuen, sir.

148
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,833
This is the way
that I operate,

149
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:48,125
and I refuse to settle for
anything less than that.

150
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,708
I see. Well then,
do whatever you want.

151
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,791
It's way better for us if
you're out of the game.

152
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,625
Oh, there was one other
thing I wanted to ask you.

153
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,708
You're familiar with
Ibuki, aren't you?

154
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,666
[RYUEN]
Of course, she's in our class.

155
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,291
So? What's it to you?

156
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,708
[SUZUNE] Her face was
messed up pretty badly.

157
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,291
Do you know how it may
have gotten that way?

158
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,625
Disobedient servants are
of no use to a ruler.

159
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:17,333
I only doled out the
appropriate punishment.

160
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,250
[SUZUNE]
You used up all of your S-points

161
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,166
on the first day, didn't you?

162
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,916
That's exactly right.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I spent all our class's
S-points yesterday.

164
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,750
So it doesn't really matter.

165
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:34,916
Ibuki can do what she wants and
it won't affect our S-points.

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,416
[AYANOKOJI] The rules state
that, even if you lose

167
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,083
all 300 of your S-points,
you can't ever

168
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,583
get into negative numbers.
He used that to his advantage.

169
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,458
A simplistic way of thinking.

170
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,458
I guess you don't mind
losing all the class points

171
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,833
we were offered.

172
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,458
[RYUEN]
Forget all of that.

173
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,833
Why don't you just
come play with me?

174
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,333
I'll prepare a special
tent for us, Suzune.

175
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,583
[SUZUNE] Let's get
out of here, Ayanokoji.

176
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,833
If I stay any longer, this
guy's gonna make me vomit.

177
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,750
Suzune, come back
when you're ready

178
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,333
to have the time of your life.
You know you want to.

179
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll blow your mind if you would
just give me the afternoon.

180
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,791
Absurd, isn't it?

181
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,833
But their bad
decision benefits us.

182
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:21,958
Yeah.

183
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,500
In this test,
you need to conserve

184
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,833
any way that you can,
or there's no way

185
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,458
you'll last the whole week.

186
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,291
He's not planning to
last the whole week,

187
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,333
which is the reason
he did what he did.

188
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,916
What do you mean by that?

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,791
[AYANOKOJI]
It's pretty simple.

190
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,541
He'll do exactly
what Koenji did.

191
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,666
Cut any losses and run.

192
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,125
All they have to do
is claim to be sick,

193
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,458
or that they can't
handle the stress.

194
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,083
Then they can all
go back to the ship

195
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,208
and enjoy the rest of their
summer vacation in comfort.

196
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,125
Hold on, so you're
telling me that he never

197
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,958
had any intention of
participating in the test?

198
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,125
Well, this exam is about
freedom of choice, isn't it?

199
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,791
Ryuen might have
the best answer.

200
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,750
After all, he chose comfort.

201
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,833
I don't know. That's beyond me.

202
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,833
[AYANOKOJI] A zero point
strategy. Fascinating.

203
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,958
[snoring]

204
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,958
Good morning to you, Hirata.

205
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,125
Oh, morning, Ayanokoji.

206
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,833
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

207
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,333
[AYANOKOJI]
No, you didn't.

208
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,916
It's just hard for me
to sleep very well

209
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,333
in this kind of environment.

210
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,708
My back is killing me.

211
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,250
[laughs]

212
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,208
[HIRATA sighs]
That feels great.

213
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,708
[AYANOKOJI] It must be
stressful to be the one

214
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,458
keeping the class together.

215
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,166
I only do it because I enjoy it.

216
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,125
If I didn't, there is
no way I'd take that on.

217
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,666
I just like seeing
the class happy.

218
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,416
[BOYS laughing]

219
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,500
[SAKURA panting]

220
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,875
Are you really sure you
wanna be paired up with me?

221
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,083
Yeah. I'm sorry.

222
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,208
I know that I can be a total
drag when we're searching.

223
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,958
And you're not the
least bit worried?

224
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,416
People might start
to talk about us.

225
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,083
No, I couldn't care
less about it,

226
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,500
to tell you the truth.
And, anyway.

227
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,958
When we first set
out on the cruise,

228
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,791
I was feeling really down
in the dumps about it.

229
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,750
I don't have a single friend so,

230
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,541
I didn't see how a
cruise could be any fun.

231
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,750
But now... Now, I'm
having a good time.

232
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,416
I'm actually happy that I came.

233
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,291
I see.

234
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,750
[gasps]

235
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,041
[SAKURA]
Man, it's too bad.

236
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,500
If I had my camera right now,

237
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,916
I could take an
amazing picture of you.

238
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,250
[ICHINOSE]
Weird.

239
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,458
I wonder where they all
could have gone to.

240
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,208
[KANZAKI] Ayanokoji,
were you out on recon, too?

241
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,125
No, we were just out
exploring the forest.

242
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,208
And we ended up here
on the beach.

243
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,375
[ICHINOSE]
Aw. I'm so disappointed.

244
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,416
I was hoping to get an idea
of who Class C's leader is.

245
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,250
The primary goal
here is to amass

246
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,166
as many S-points as possible.

247
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,833
Too bad Ryuen gave up,
and so, he lost everything.

248
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,291
The straightforward
approach is definitely

249
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,333
the best strategy for us.

250
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,375
Ichinose.

251
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,166
There's something I've been
wanting to ask you about.

252
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,375
[ICHINOSE]
What's that?

253
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,875
[AYANOKOJI]
Well, Katsuragi from Class A.

254
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,666
Do you know anything about him?

255
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,833
You're interested in Katsuragi?

256
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,541
Well, I know that Sakayanagi is
sitting out the test completely.

257
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,000
So Katsuragi has now taken

258
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,833
temporary leadership
over Class A.

259
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,916
[KANZAKI]
Katsuragi's an intelligent guy.

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,708
Even with Sakayanagi gone,

261
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,500
I doubt Class A will suffer
much internal discord.

262
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,708
[ICHINOSE]
Although...

263
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,750
I doubt anyone who is
on Sakayanagi's side

264
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,250
is having a very good time.

265
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,375
Those two are opposite
extremes, after all.

266
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,833
Opposite extremes?

267
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,791
[ICHINOSE] A reformist and
a conservative, essentially.

268
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,708
Their approach to everything
is the polar opposite,

269
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,000
and I hear they're always
butting heads over that.

270
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,958
[AYANOKOJI]
Sakayanagi.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,666
[STUDENTS chattering]

272
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,708
[IKE] Looks like we made
it through another day!

273
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,833
By the way,

274
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,458
I thought I saw all
the Class C people

275
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,166
heading to the ship
this afternoon.

276
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,208
Hirata, you know
anything about that?

277
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,166
No. I wish I did.

278
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,375
They probably just got
sick of the island life

279
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,416
and decided to quit
and head back to the ship.

280
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,041
You think the whole class did?

281
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,666
Can they even do that?

282
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,333
Why would I know any
better than you do?

283
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,291
[KIKYO]
Hey.

284
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,916
Are you going to head
back to the ship?

285
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,875
The last thing I wanna look
at is those jerks' faces.

286
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,583
So I am going to stay here.

287
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,208
[KEN] Seems kinda
suspicious, doesn't it?

288
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,541
[KIKYO]
Sudo, don't.

289
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,750
Hey.

290
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,375
Do you know anything
about what they planned?

291
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,416
Huh? No, leave me alone.

292
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,625
[KEN]
Hold it!

293
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,166
[IBUKI] You keep your
filthy hands off me!

294
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,958
What the heck is your problem?

295
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,791
We helped you,
so you owe us one.

296
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,708
Or, did you conveniently
forget about that?

297
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,291
I didn't even ask for
your help, remember?

298
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,375
Your people just forced
their help upon me.

299
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,458
Wasting your points
on an enemy? Idiots.

300
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,958
--Say that again!
--[HIRATA] Sudo!

301
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,333
Go ahead and hit me, then!

302
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,041
Both of you need to calm down.

303
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,708
This isn't the time for us to
start fighting among friends.

304
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,333
We're friends?
How stupid can you be?

305
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,833
[KIKYO]
Ibuki. Are you okay?

306
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,375
[KEN]
Damn it! What's her problem?

307
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,916
[SHINO]
Hey, you guys!

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,041
Guys, wake up already, come on!

309
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,541
[HASE]
Seriously, get up, now!

310
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,541
What's going on?

311
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,375
Look, Hirata. I've got bad news!

312
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,833
[HIRATA] What could it
possibly be? It's so early.

313
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,208
This probably has nothing
to do with you, Hirata.

314
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,250
But there's something we need

315
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,625
to get to the bottom
of right now.

316
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,791
This morning,
Karuizawa's underwear

317
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,333
went missing from her bag.

318
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,833
[gasps]

319
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,333
[SHINO] She's in our tent right
now, bawling her eyes out.

320
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,625
Kushida and the others
are trying to comfort her

321
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,583
to no avail.

322
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,166
Hold on. What are you saying?

323
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,375
You can't possibly suspect--!

324
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,750
[SHINO] Well, why shouldn't
we suspect you?

325
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,750
One of you obviously
snuck in and stole them

326
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:07,583
in the middle of the night!

327
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,208
You've got to be kidding.

328
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,125
It was probably that Ibuki
girl trying to frame us!

329
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,041
[SHINO] A girl would never
do something like that!

330
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,500
[IKE]
But how can you be so sure?

331
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,333
Look, the point is,
we refuse to camp

332
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,125
in the same place as an
underwear-thieving pervert!

333
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,500
[GIRLS chattering]

334
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,791
[HIRATA] Hey, everyone,
just calm down for a minute.

335
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,750
What proof do you have that
one of the Class D boys

336
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,166
stole the underwear, anyway?

337
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,875
That's why we came to you.

338
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,416
We trust you to find
the culprit for us.

339
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,375
You want me to do it?

340
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,208
To begin, we request
to conduct a search

341
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,916
of all the boys' bags!

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,708
[HIRATA]
Okay, fine.

343
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,291
But to protect their privacy,
will you agree to allow me

344
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,666
to conduct the search,
instead of you guys?

345
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,791
Come on. I'm startin'
to get pissed off.

346
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,125
They don't even
have any evidence

347
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,708
that a boy actually
did it. It's crazy!

348
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,083
[stammering]

349
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,083
What's wrong?

350
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,458
[IKE]
Uh, nothing.

351
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,208
Wait just a minute.

352
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,958
You're the one who
stole them, aren't you?

353
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,333
Dumbass! No, man, I'm not!

354
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,833
Uh-huh. No way.
Don't tell me that...

355
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,500
Of course not. Don't
start suspecting me!

356
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,916
[YAMAUCHI] Show me what
you've got in there!

357
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,291
Cut it out! I'm
innocent, I swear.

358
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,833
I didn't do anything!

359
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,708
[YAMAUCHI]
Caught red-handed!

360
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,041
No! I don't know how
they got there, I promise!

361
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,958
It wasn't me, dude.
I swear it wasn't!

362
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,375
No need to lie,

363
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,208
everyone's got their kinks, man.

364
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,041
I don't know how
they got in my bag!

365
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,958
[GIRLS murmuring]

366
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,416
Hey, you!

367
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,333
You believe I'm
innocent here, don't you?

368
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,791
Under the current
circumstances...

369
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,583
I can't say with
any level of certainty

370
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,833
that you're not the culprit.

371
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,083
A-Ayanokoji, why?

372
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,541
But, if you were,

373
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,208
I don't think you'd be so
careless. You'd cover it up.

374
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,458
You're right!

375
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,041
So, you think someone else

376
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,375
planted the panties
in Ike's bag?

377
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,666
Yeah!

378
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,333
That's gotta be what
happened, don'tcha think?

379
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,958
Hey! Hurry, it up!

380
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,875
What do I do? What do I do?

381
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,666
I'm in major trouble!

382
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,208
Good luck, man!

383
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,208
Uh--

384
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,333
You're gonna have to
hide them somewhere.

385
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,333
Oh, will I? Hide them
where? Help me out!

386
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,916
If you think hiding
them is the best idea,

387
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,708
then you hide them
yourself, smarty-pants!

388
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,875
[AYANOKOJI]
Hold on. I didn't mean--

389
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,375
[IKE]
I'll be right there!

390
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,000
Huh. You're kidding me.

391
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,625
[HIRATA]
We searched all the bags.

392
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,625
For real?

393
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,791
[HIRATA]
Mm-hm. So, now we know.

394
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,375
None of the boys here
were behind the theft.

395
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,166
We can let them put their
stuff away now, right?

396
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,333
And then we can talk
about the next step.

397
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,166
I demand a pat-down.

398
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,500
Uh--?

399
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,833
An underwear thief must
have a very deviant mind.

400
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,000
No telling where he
might be keeping them.

401
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,000
What?

402
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,375
Could you give us
a break already?

403
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,583
[INO] Ike's been acting
suspicious this whole time.

404
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,708
[SHINO] You think he's
the one who did it?

405
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,750
[MIT]
So gross!

406
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,125
[IKE growls]
Fine, have it your way.

407
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,375
Why don't you guys
just search me, then?

408
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,916
[AYANOKOJI] No, don't lead the
conversation down that path.

409
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,291
Yes, why don't we?

410
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,291
Hirata. Go ahead.

411
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,625
[AYANOKOJI] This is the worst
thing that could happen.

412
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,291
There's no way of talking
myself out of it.

413
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,666
I'd be better off
if I just told the truth.

414
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,458
They might believe me.

415
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,250
[HIRATA] Sorry. I'll make
this as quick as possible.

416
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,666
[AYANOKOJI]
It's over.

417
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,875
[gasps]

418
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,416
[HIRATA] Ayanokoji doesn't
have them, either.

419
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,916
[AYANOKOJI gasps]

420
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,833
So you can rest assured
it wasn't one of us.

421
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,416
[SHINO] Really? Well, if you
say so, I can trust it.

422
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,666
[HIRATA]
Thanks.

423
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,958
Right.

424
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,500
I'll let the others know,
if that's okay with you.

425
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,875
[SATO]
Yeah. See you later, then.

426
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,208
[AYANOKOJI]
Hirata. Can we talk for a sec?

427
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,166
Why didn't you tell
them what you found?

428
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,000
I thought so. That was
the underwear, then?

429
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,500
Yeah.

430
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,791
Did you take them, Ayanokoji?

431
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,666
No. I didn't.

432
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,666
Good, I believe you.

433
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,416
You aren't the kind of person
who'd do something like that.

434
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,125
Well, that's quite
a relief, but I think

435
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,541
it would be best if I
took those off your hands.

436
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,333
Are you sure?

437
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,041
Yeah, it's the only way.

438
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,291
I'll suffer least for
being the culprit.

439
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,333
I'm her boyfriend, after all.

440
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:34,208
[HIRATA] I really do believe
you didn't do it, Ayanokoji.

441
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,666
That's why I saved you.

442
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,375
And, the way you answer
won't change that,

443
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:44,541
but I just have to ask. Will
you find the actual culprit?

444
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,166
Me, help find the culprit?

445
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,583
Yes.

446
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:55,166
Well, I'll try my absolute
best to, at least.

447
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,375
Thanks a lot.

448
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,250
And if you do, will you let
me be the first to know?

449
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,458
Please?

450
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,583
I don't want anybody
else to hear about it.

451
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,500
So I need you to promise
that you'll tell me

452
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,083
before anyone else.

453
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,958
Are you asking me to help you
cover up the truth in all this?

454
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,791
"Cover up the truth." Huh.

455
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,583
Yeah, I guess that
is what I'm asking.

456
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,875
Because, no matter who it is,

457
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:22,500
I think it would be best for
us to bury the real story.

458
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:29,708
[HIRATA] I don't want everything
to be ruined over this.

459
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,250
So that's why

460
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,083
I would like your mind
working with me on it.

[IKE yelling]

00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,125
[MALE STUDENTS yelling]

4
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,958
[YAMAUCHI]
We owe it all to you, Kushida!

5
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,541
[KEN] Yeah, you totally saved
our butts on this one!

6
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,916
You guys, it's not like
I took the test for you!

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,666
[IKE]
You're an angel!

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,166
Kushida, you must have been sent
from heaven to help us pass!

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,125
[SUZUNE]
Ayanokoji.

10
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,500
Be honest.
What exactly did you do?

11
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,333
[FEMALE STUDENT 3B]
Nice serve!

12
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,500
[KEN]
You want some? Come and get it!

13
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,625
What, do you think you're in
some kind of gangster movie

14
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,000
with that thug act?

15
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,416
Man, you're ugly inside
and out, you pathetic loser.

16
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,083
[growls] Say that again, punk!

17
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,541
[AYANOKOJI] Kushida asked me
to try to get him

18
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,291
to come to her study group,
but I don't know.

19
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,041
[RYUEN] I can't wait to see
how many Class D idiots

20
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,458
get expelled after
they fail the next test.

21
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,041
[KEN whimpers]

22
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,333
I bet I know who will be first.

23
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,416
[whimpering]

24
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,625
[KEN]
I hope you've said your prayers.

25
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,333
All right, that's enough!

26
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,666
What? Who're you?

27
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,833
Keep your damn nose out of it!

28
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,750
As one of your fellow students,
I cannot allow violence

29
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,541
to be perpetrated on this
campus, understand?

30
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,500
If you all insist on
continuing to fight anyway,

31
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,166
I'm going to have
to call security.

32
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,458
Look, Ichinose.

33
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,500
There isn't even a
fight to continue.

34
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,208
Sudo's victimizing us.

35
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,500
Is that so?

36
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,833
Well, from where I'm standing,

37
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,541
you certainly don't look
like victims to me, Ryuen.

38
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,458
And if you don't cut it out,
I'm going to report

39
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,541
every one of you to
the administration.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,041
Hey, monkey.

41
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,625
You son of a--

42
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,041
[RYUEN] I think you're going to
make a mighty fine plaything.

43
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,458
Hey, punk! You runnin' away?

44
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,791
Answer me!

45
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,041
I'm talkin' to you!

46
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,791
[AYANOKOJI]
Relax.

47
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,375
[ICHINOSE]
Listen, Sudo.

48
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,208
Don't let him get you all
wound up like that, okay?

49
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,458
Shut your mouth.
You don't rule me.

50
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,958
Sorry for all the drama, guys!
Everything's cool now!

51
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,833
[FEMALE STUDENT 3A]
Thanks a bunch, Ichinose!

52
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,750
Okay guys, do your best
to stay out of trouble.

53
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,625
See ya!

54
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,291
Dammit!

55
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,625
Sudo. Are you free
for the next hour?

56
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,291
Kushida wants you to come
to her study group.

57
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,875
No way. I've got practice.

58
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,500
[AYANOKOJI]
Ike and Yamauchi are both in it.

59
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,750
Hey.

60
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,250
Are you sure you'll be
all right on your own?

61
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,000
[KEN] There's no point in
cramming for it now.

62
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,875
I'll take my chances.

63
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,291
[MALE STUDENT 3A]
Sudo!

64
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,291
[MALE STUDENT 3A] What's
the matter with you today?

65
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,000
[KEN]
Sorry!

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,125
[SUZUNE]
Hey, Sudo.

67
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,250
Can we talk for a minute?

68
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,541
Are you seriously okay

69
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,250
with getting expelled
from this school?

70
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,958
Just get off my back.

71
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,500
So, you'd give it up, then.

72
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,833
Basketball?

73
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,916
I've summarized all
the information from class

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,416
in this notebook.

75
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,541
[SUZUNE]
Just so you know,

76
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,500
I'm only doing this for my own
sake. You really should study

77
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,833
for yours, if you know
what's good for you.

78
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,166
That way you won't get expelled
and you can keep playing on

79
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,458
the basketball team
at this school.

80
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,666
[KIKYO] Ayanokoji. I can't
believe you invited me to lunch.

81
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,875
This sure is a first!

82
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,125
Did you want to talk to me
about something?

83
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,500
Yeah, just promise you won't
breathe a word to anyone.

84
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,000
[KIKYO]
Mm-hm!

85
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,333
[gasps]

86
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,541
Let's go.

87
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,625
[AYANOKOJI] Excuse me.
Are you an upperclassman?

88
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,625
I'm Kiyotaka Ayanokoji
from Class One-D.

89
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,875
You're in the D class for
your grade, too, aren't you?

90
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,041
Well, yeah.

91
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,333
[AYANOKOJI]
The free food selection

92
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,333
is pretty abysmal, isn't it?

93
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,166
[SEN]
What do you want from me?

94
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,458
I wanna consult with
you about something.

95
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,791
Don't worry, I will make
it worth your while.

96
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,291
About what?

97
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,333
Do you still have any of your
class's midterm questions

98
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,666
from two years ago?

99
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,666
[gasps]

100
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,250
I want you to hand
them over to me.

101
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,166
Why are you asking me, and not
the other upperclassmen?

102
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,708
Is it that hard to see?

103
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,833
People like you, who're
short on class points,

104
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,083
are way more likely to see

105
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,208
the benefit of striking
a deal with us.

106
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,625
And don't think I didn't notice
how hard you were struggling

107
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,916
to eat that wild
vegetable lunch combo.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,125
[SEN sighs]

109
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,250
[SEN]
How much will you pay?

110
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,916
[AYANOKOJI]
Ten thousand points.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,458
It's as high as I'll go.

112
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,583
[SEN] I'd be taking
a big risk here, too.

113
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,083
I would need 30,000
at the very least.

114
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,750
[AYANOKOJI]
I'm afraid that won't work.

115
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,000
Sorry to disappoint.

116
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,708
You can forget making
a deal with me, then.

117
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,708
[KIKYO]
Please reconsider!

118
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,625
We're doing this to prevent
a friend of ours from

119
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,083
getting kicked out of school!
I'm begging you to help us.

120
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,333
[gasping]

121
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,708
[AYANOKOJI]
10,000.

122
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,916
No, 25.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,375
[AYANOKOJI]
10,000.

124
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,916
20,000.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,708
[AYANOKOJI]
10,000. That's it.

126
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,083
[SEN growls]
15,000.

127
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,291
I can't possibly go any lower.

128
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,750
I can live with that.
You've got a deal.

129
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,500
That is, if you
include your quizzes

130
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,791
from the first term as a bonus.

131
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,083
[SEN]
Okay...

132
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,250
I can't ever thank you enough!

133
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,083
[KIKYO]
But, still...

134
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,833
How do you know that
it'll be okay?

135
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,166
Don't worry about it.

136
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,458
This is all well
within school rules.

137
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,875
I suppose that could be true.
But studying old test questions?

138
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,208
That feels an awful lot
like cheating.

139
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,291
I disagree with you on that.

140
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,625
His reaction to our proposition
only confirmed my theory.

141
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,791
Trading old test questions
among students is

142
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,125
nothing out of the
ordinary at this school.

143
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,875
Maybe that's because they're
just that: old questions.

144
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,041
What if this year's exam

145
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,458
isn't anything like
the one from before?

146
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,583
The old test may not contain
the exact same questions,

147
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,750
but I'm willing to bet it'll
still cover the same content.

148
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,000
You think so?

149
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,625
Try not to worry about it.

150
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,083
This is our first
line of defense

151
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,375
against Sudo and the
others getting expelled.

152
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,500
[phone chimes]

153
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,083
[AYANOKOJI] Here we go.
He started with a quiz.

154
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,166
It's the same. Identical,
down to the letter.

155
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,333
Oh, that's great!

156
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,250
So, what does that mean
about the midterm?

157
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,750
It'll prob'ly be the same
as last years, too.

158
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,291
We should show that
to the whole class,

159
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,500
not just the people
in danger of failing.

160
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,791
Not yet.

161
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,458
We'll hold off on showing
it to them for now.

162
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,875
But, why?

163
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,458
Say we show them the
questions ahead of time.

164
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,250
What do you think they'll
do in that knowledge?

165
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:52,541
[gasps] They'll memorize all
the answers instead of study!

166
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,125
That's precisely it.

167
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,791
Ayanokoji, are you a lot
smarter than you let on?

168
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,541
I'd say I'm more
cunning than smart.

169
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,916
[AYANOKOJI] Hey. Do you think
you could do me a favor?

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,291
[gasps]

171
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,208
[AYANOKOJI] When we do this,
can you tell the class

172
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,291
that you're the one
who got the questions?

173
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,666
Sure, if you want, but
wouldn't you like to get credit

174
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,083
for your hard work?

175
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,125
I don't like to draw attention
to myself unnecessarily.

176
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,708
And anyway.

177
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,291
I think our classmates trust you
a little more than they do me.

178
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,625
Okay, then.

179
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,166
If you're positive that's
what you really want.

180
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,666
I appreciate it.

181
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,541
Well. I guess this
means you and I

182
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,791
have our own little
secret, don't we?

183
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,000
[KIKYO]
Hang on, everyone!

184
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,291
There's something
I want you to have

185
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,500
before you leave for the day.

186
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,375
What, test questions?

187
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,375
Did you make these up,
or something?

188
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,833
[KIKYO] Actually, they're
questions that were on

189
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,500
the midterm a couple years ago.

190
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,833
I got them last night from
one of the third years.

191
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,208
Seriously?

192
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,000
[KIKYO] Mm-hm. He told me
that the tests have been

193
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,708
pretty much identical for
the last couple of years.

194
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:56,958
So, I bet they'll be helpful

195
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,791
in studying for
tomorrow's test, too!

196
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,791
Are you freaking kidding me?!

197
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,208
Heck, I wish I'd had these

198
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,083
before I ran myself
ragged studying.

199
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,708
This is awesome!

200
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,291
[KIKYO]
Here you go, Koenji!

201
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,833
I beg your pardon, but I don't
need to resort to such tactics.

202
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,583
And I've got a hot date
tonight, so excuse me.

203
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,250
Have fun with your studying.

204
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,500
[KIKYO gasping]

205
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,750
Hey, Kushida.

206
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,416
I know things like this
might be beneath you,

207
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,625
but I want you to have one, too.

208
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,958
Can I ask you a question?

209
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,458
Thanks a million, Kushida!

210
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,250
I shall be forever in your debt!

211
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,125
[KIKYO laughs]

212
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,916
To be honest, I think the only
reason I might have done okay...

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,083
I can't say I'm surprised.
Kushida plays the role well.

214
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,833
That's an insult.

215
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,250
I must say,
I'm impressed with you.

216
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,750
I never imagined you'd be able
to bring your scores up

217
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,208
so much on this exam.

218
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,041
I acknowledge that you
must have put in the effort.

219
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,750
However...

220
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,500
[CHABASHIRA]
Sudo got a failing grade.

221
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,958
Too bad.

222
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,750
[KEN gasping]

223
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,208
[KEN]
What? You've got to be kidding!

224
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,083
How could I possibly
have failed?!

225
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,625
[CHABASHIRA]
The threshold for failure

226
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,958
on the midterm exam
was 40 points.

227
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,833
The average class
test score was 79.6.

228
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,916
When I divide that by two

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,375
then round up to 40 points,

230
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,750
I get the minimum
score needed to pass.

231
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,000
By less than a point?

232
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,041
We only knew each other
for a short time,

233
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,541
and I know you tried.

234
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,958
Your expulsion notice will be
issued after class anyway.

235
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,375
So, that's it?

236
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,916
I'm getting expelled?

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,333
Wait, Miss Chabashira!

238
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,541
Is there anything
we can do to save him?

239
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,000
[CHABASHIRA] A failing score
is a failing score.

240
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,791
Are you sure that's
the final word?!

241
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,500
We just can't let Sudo get
kicked out like this!

242
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,333
It doesn't seem right.

243
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,666
Rules exist for a reason.
Just get over it.

244
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,666
[gasps]

245
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,875
Homeroom is over for today.
Sudo, I'll be waiting for you

246
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,333
in the faculty office
after school.

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,958
[door slides]

248
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,791
Well, are we just gonna
let them do this? It's terrible.

249
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,541
Sudo is going to be expelled.

250
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,083
[KIKYO]
Ayanokoji?

251
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,375
Sorry. Gotta go to the restroom.

252
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,958
[gasps]

253
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,833
[door slides]

254
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,666
What do you want?

255
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,125
You'll be tardy if you don't
head back to class.

256
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,458
Yeah, I know.

257
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,000
But I have a question.

258
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,625
A burning question.

259
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,000
Make it fast.

260
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,333
Right now, in Japan,
do you believe

261
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,416
that our society is equal?

262
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,333
That's quite a question
for a boy of your age.

263
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,791
But is there any point in my
answering it this moment?

264
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,583
It's important to me.

265
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,875
I would appreciate an answer.

266
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,125
[CHABASHIRA] Well, speaking
from my own experience.

267
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:21,625
Our society is definitely not
equal. Not in the least.

268
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,500
[AYANOKOJI]
I'm inclined to agree with you.

269
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,458
The word "equality" is
a lie that we're told.

270
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,750
But still. Humans are rational.

271
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,791
We didn't become social
beings for no reason.

272
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,875
[CHABASHIRA]
What are you trying to say?

273
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,875
[AYANOKOJI] What I'm saying is,
for rules to be effective,

274
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,291
they have to at least appear
to apply equally to everybody.

275
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,750
Huh?!

276
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,625
So, what do you want?

277
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:51,500
Sell me a point on that test,
to add to Sudo's score.

278
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,250
[laughs]

279
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,333
You sure are an interesting kid.

280
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,541
Do you really expect me to
sell you a single test point?

281
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, why not?

282
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,333
It goes along with what you
told us on the first day.

283
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,500
To make purchases,
you will spend points,

284
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,125
which are tracked using the
school's computer system.

285
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,583
At this school, you can buy

286
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,916
absolutely anything
on campus with these.

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,708
For rules to work, they must
be applied across the board,

288
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,583
even when it comes
to the midterm.

289
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,083
I see what you mean.

290
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,250
Maybe there is something to
your little idea after all.

291
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,791
However, that doesn't mean you
can afford that single point.

292
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:28,875
It's quite a lot.

293
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,000
So, give me a number.

294
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,750
[CHABASHIRA]
Let me see.

295
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,791
If you can cough up
100,000 points,

296
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,500
right here and now, then
we'll have an agreement.

297
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,875
That's just cruel,
Ms. Chabashira.

298
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,083
That's part of the rules, too.

299
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,916
[SUZUNE]
I'll help cover it.

300
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,916
[SUZUNE] We don't know what
the punishment is.

301
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,875
The price for losing one of our
classmates might be high.

302
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,041
I've determined that there
may be certain advantages

303
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,625
to us keeping Sudo around.

304
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,625
Horikita.

305
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,041
[CHABASHIRA chuckles]

306
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,125
I thought that you people
might keep me on my toes.

307
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:07,416
Very well then.
I'll sell you Sudo's test point.

308
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,291
You can tell him you saved him.
He won't be expelled after all.

309
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,791
[AYANOKOJI]
Are you sure about this?

310
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,416
[CHABASHIRA]
You made your case and I agreed.

311
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,666
I couldn't refuse now.

312
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,791
Just so you're aware, never
in this school's history

313
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,541
has a D class
managed to advance.

314
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,875
Do you think you'll
be the first?

315
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,666
I can't speak for him, but I
will ascend to a higher class.

316
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,875
Is that so?

317
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,000
And how do defectives
such as yourselves,

318
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,916
plan to achieve such a goal?

319
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,833
From what I've seen "defectives"
can sometimes be fixed

320
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,291
with only the slightest
of alterations.

321
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,416
At least in my experience.

322
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,000
[CHABASHIRA chuckles] I can't
wait to see how that turns out.

323
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,208
As your teacher, I sincerely
hope that you succeed.

324
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,500
[KATSURAGI]
Class C is gaining on us.

325
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,291
Looks like Ryuen must
be at work again.

326
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,500
He's dangerous for us.

327
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,250
Don't you find it all boring?

328
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,916
Class A has 1,004 points.

329
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,708
For some perspective,
we only have 87 right now.

330
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:31,166
To be honest, becoming Class A
feels like a pipe dream.

331
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,708
[SUZUNE]
I'm not going to give up.

332
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,625
I will advance to Class A,
no matter what.

333
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,708
If you say so.

334
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,625
What's that?

335
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,416
Well. I definitely owe ya one.

336
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Thanks for jumping in
to help me save Sudo.

337
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,000
Didn't I tell you?

338
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,333
I did that to benefit myself
and for no other purpose.

339
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,500
[AYANOKOJI] Hm...
Is that really the only reason?

340
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,375
What are you talking about?

341
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,958
I think you care more
than you let on.

342
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,250
You knew Sudo would
get a borderline score

343
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,833
on the English midterm.

344
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,041
So you intentionally
lowered your score.

345
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,000
That's a very nice thing
to do for someone

346
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,250
you once fought with.

347
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,250
Wonder why you changed
your mind about him.

348
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,250
I told you, I only did it to
help us advance to Class A.

349
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,666
[AYANOKOJI]
Yeah, okay.

350
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,333
Just keep tellin' yourself that.

351
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,375
[SUZUNE]
Hey. You've got an attitude.

352
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,500
I don't like it very much,
Ayanokoji.

353
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,958
Uh...

354
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,583
[SUZUNE] You'll regret it
if it causes you to suffer,

355
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:29,250
or you'll regret it
if you feel despair.

356
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,416
Which of the above experiences
would you prefer?

357
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,625
[AYANOKOJI] Well, if it's up to
me, I think I'll take "neither."

358
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,791
But what's she doing
with that compass?

359
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,291
[thud]

360
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,708
[AYANOKOJI]
Ouch.

361
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,541
[STUDENTS]
Cheers!

362
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,375
[sighs]

363
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,458
Hey! Why the long face, man?

364
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,083
I have no objections to the
fact that we're celebrating,

365
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,291
and I'm glad to be a part of it.

366
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,458
But why does it have
to be in my room?

367
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,833
[YAMAUCHI] Man, that was
a close call, am I right?

368
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,291
If Kushida hadn't gotten
those old test questions,

369
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:04,208
Ike and Sudo would be long gone
by now, you know what I mean?

370
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,708
Hey. You just barely
squeaked by, too, y'know.

371
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,791
I just haven't gotten
my act together yet.

372
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,041
[IKE] Sudo, how did you
manage to fail...

373
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,291
[KIKYO]
Hey, Ayanokoji!

374
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,041
What is it?

375
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,333
[KIKYO]
How were you able to get them

376
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,916
to take back Sudo's expulsion?

377
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,708
Horikita talked to
the administration.

378
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,500
She told them that it wasn't
right to expel someone

379
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,208
as they're struggling to learn.
She said it's a process.

380
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,708
--Hey, wait a minute.
--Horikita, is that true?

381
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:37,541
I've never seen her speak so
passionately about anything.

382
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,875
It was quite impressive.

383
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,333
She presented this carefully
constructed indictment,

384
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,125
and none of them
could argue with her.

385
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,875
That's amazing, Horikita.
You're a real hero.

386
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,875
Wow, I guess I had the wrong
idea about you all along!

387
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,875
Can you believe it? All for you.

388
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:55,750
No, I can't. Why would she
do that for my sake?

389
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,166
Look, I didn't.

390
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,750
I was doing it for my own
benefit and nothing else.

391
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,833
[YAMAUCHI laughs] Wow, beauty,
passion, and brains!

392
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,250
[IKE]
I'll say!

393
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:08,500
[water running,
dishes clattering]

394
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,291
Thanks for helping me out.
I really appreciate it.

395
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,708
I should thank you!

396
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,250
You didn't have to let us have
the party in your room.

397
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,750
No prob.

398
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,166
[KIKYO]
Hey, can I ask you something?

399
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,541
Yeah, what?

400
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,416
[KIKYO]
Well, would you say that girls

401
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,083
like Horikita are your type?

402
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,500
I'm just curious.

403
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,375
I always see you two together,

404
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,083
and all the girls in class
are talking about it.

405
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,458
Horikita and I are just friends.

406
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,291
No, she's just my neighbor.

407
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,875
I see.

408
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,250
Okay, then.

409
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,791
I guess I should
head back to my room.

410
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:47,666
Right.

411
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,291
[KIKYO]
Well, goodnight.

412
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,166
Goodnight to you, too.

413
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,000
Uh?

414
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,791
[AYANOKOJI] I thought the girls
were on the higher floors.

415
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,250
[AYANOKOJI] Where could she be
going this late at night?

416
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,875
[AYANOKOJI] I don't see why
I should be hiding, but...

417
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,291
[KIKYO]
What a pain in the ass.

418
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,541
Uh?

419
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,208
[KIKYO] So, you think
you're better than me

420
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,916
just because you're prettier?

421
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,583
I hate your guts!

422
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,750
I swear to god, I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you!

423
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,250
I wish you would just
drop dead, Horikita!

424
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,875
I hate you! I hate you!

425
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,833
You stupid cow!

426
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,083
[phone chimes]

427
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,083
Who's there?
Is someone spying on me?

428
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,000
[AYANOKOJI]
It's just me.

429
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,833
Ayanokoji.

430
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,583
I'm sorry. You left
your phone in my room.

431
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,375
Did you hear me?

432
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,916
If I told you that I didn't,
would you believe me?

433
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,625
If you breathe a word about
this to anyone, you'll pay.

434
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,708
[AYANOKOJI]
How, exactly?

435
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,958
I'll tell everyone in the entire
school you attempted to rape me.

436
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:24,791
[AYANOKOJI]
But you know that isn't true.

437
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,125
[KIKYO]
You're wrong.

438
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,291
I have the evidence to prove it.

439
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,958
[gasps]

440
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,375
Your fingerprints and DNA
in a very telling location.

441
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,291
That's all the proof I need.

442
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,541
I'm deadly serious.

443
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:43,458
I understand. Can I please
go back to my room?

444
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,708
[KIKYO]
You got it?

445
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,541
If you betray me,
I'll make you pay.

446
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,083
[inaudible]

447
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,333
[KIKYO]
Ayanokoji.

448
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,708
I want you to answer
just one question.

449
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,458
Can you promise me right now
that you won't tell anyone

450
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,541
what you heard me say?

451
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,666
[KIKYO]
I'm glad to hear it,

452
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,416
and I choose to believe
you for the time being.

453
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,625
[exhales] All right, then!

454
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:24,208
Well, I guess this means
we have another secret!

455
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:28,125
[AYANOKOJI]
Kushida. I don't understand.

456
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,083
Who are you, really?

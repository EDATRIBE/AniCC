00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,291
When we were fighting with Sudo,

177
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,666
I got the feeling
someone was watching.

178
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,416
Bad boy.

179
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,333
--[thuds]
--[ISHIZAKI groaning]

180
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,416
[ISHIZAKI groans]

181
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,291
You look like a
proper victim now.

182
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,833
Yes. Thank you, sir,
you're always right.

183
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:04,833
Perform your little dance well.
Just like we planned.

184
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,000
[IKE]
This is all Sudo's fault.

185
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,250
It totally sucks.

186
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,958
I don't know how I'll
survive another month

187
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,583
living on zero points.

188
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,333
Maybe we really would be better
off if he had gotten expelled.

189
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,333
I hear that for sure.

190
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,541
So, do you agree with them?

191
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:28,083
That Sudo should have gotten
expelled for failing?

192
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,625
I have no opinion.

193
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,208
But, what are your
thoughts on it?

194
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,333
You know, since you're of the
people who helped him stay here.

195
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,750
At the moment,
our class has zero points.

196
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,750
Even if we had been penalized
for someone getting expelled,

197
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,875
we'd be no worse off
than we are now.

198
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,416
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

199
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,375
'Scuse me? I didn't like
the way you said that.

200
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,875
You never know when we might
be gaining or losing points

201
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,000
with no knowledge of it.

202
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,625
What's that supposed to mean?

203
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,458
We don't know any of the rules.

204
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,500
We might be getting negative
marks that we don't know about.

205
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,458
Demerits for an expulsion
might not hit us right now.

206
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:05,375
They might matter later.
We have no idea how it works.

207
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,333
For example, what if one of
the requirements for moving up

208
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,916
to Class A is that none of
us have been expelled?

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,625
Who can say?

210
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,291
You don't know that.

211
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,916
[AYANOKOJI] One of the
hallmarks of this school

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,083
is that they don't share
the rulebook with us.

213
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,583
If we wanna reach Class A,
we should play the game like

214
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:25,541
it's life or death, and there
are threats at every turn.

215
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,166
Anyway. Sudo is an athlete,

216
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,166
and he's in good standing
with the basketball team.

217
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,000
That could wind up
being useful in the end.

218
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,708
[HIRATA]
Hey, guys! Listen up.

219
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,541
I want to be able to
trust my classmates.

220
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,000
I think that we should band
together to find witnesses

221
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,416
as to what happened with Sudo.

222
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,666
Sure! You can count
me in on that.

223
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,708
Well, if you think that's
best, Hirata, I'm in.

224
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,250
Yeah, I want to help, too.

225
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,541
If we don't stick up for
each other, no one will.

226
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,041
Kushida says it. I do it!

227
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,666
Yeah, me, too!

228
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,000
Hey. You two are going
to join us, right?

229
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,416
Do you wanna help us help Sudo?

230
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,291
In light of everything
you just said,

231
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,250
you'll certainly be helping
them, won't you, Ayanokoji?

232
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,791
You know.

233
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,500
You're the one who wants to
advance to Class A, aren't you?

234
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,208
So, that means you're gonna
help us? Thanks so much!

235
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,708
Yeah. Guess I have to.

236
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,833
Horikita, are you in?

237
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,833
You and I should work together.

238
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,000
But if we're trying
to find witnesses,

239
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,333
Sudo should stay out of it.

240
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,833
I think that would probably
be best, don't you?

241
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,333
I agree.

242
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,833
Involving him would be
a conflict of interests.

243
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,500
Yeah, exactly.

244
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,875
Great!

245
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,125
I'm going to share our plan
with Sudo, personally.

246
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,833
I'll see you after class, then!

247
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,500
I can't believe we couldn't
find any clues or witnesses.

248
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,916
I don't know.

249
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,250
Have you considered the
possibility that Sudo is lying?

250
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,875
Well, I sure have.

251
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,750
What about Hirata's group?

252
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,416
No luck. I texted them,

253
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,333
they didn't find
anything, either.

Oh, it's Ichinose.

257
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,250
Some people in my class
told me what's going on.

258
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,750
You guys are holding an
investigation, aren't you?

259
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:07,958
Uh...

260
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,250
[ICHINOSE] Got it.
So it's the guys from Class C.

261
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,875
Yeah. Please ask around, and
if anyone knows something,

262
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,250
be sure to tell us first.

263
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,666
Definitely. Sorry I can't
help you more than that.

264
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,166
I'll tell Class B
the whole thing,

265
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,500
and they'll be happy
to help you look.

266
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,250
Really? That'd be great--

267
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,666
[screams] What are you doing?

268
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,291
[AYANOKOJI]
This is probably a plot.

269
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,000
Listen. I don't think it's wise
to rely on other classes--

270
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,708
[ICHINOSE]
Don't worry!

271
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,625
I'm not up to anything weird.

272
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,250
I do owe you one,
Ayanokoji, remember?

Hey, Ayanokoji!

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,625
[AYANOKOJI ]
Hey. Did you put up this notice?

284
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,750
Yeah! But it was Kanzaki's idea.

285
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,625
We're gathering information
through the class's

286
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,916
online message board. Uh.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,916
Look, we already
received an email!

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,166
Oh, what does it say?

289
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,833
Let's see... A character witness

290
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,083
about one of the guys Sudo
fought with, Ishizaki.

291
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,833
They say this guy was a
troublemaker in middle school.

292
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,500
Apparently, he was
a good fighter, too,

293
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,750
so everyone in school
was afraid of him.

294
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,750
That raises some red flags.

295
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,416
The other guys are on
the basketball team,

296
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,833
so they're physically fit.

297
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,708
It's unlikely Sudo could beat
all of them by himself

298
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,833
without getting hurt.

299
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,416
[ICHINOSE]
That's a good point.

300
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,750
Perhaps they initially wanted
to beat him up, but instead,

301
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,666
they decided it would
be better to frame him

302
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,125
and get him expelled.
It fits the story.

303
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,791
You're right, that's plausible.

304
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,416
Anyway, I should pay whoever
sent us the information.

305
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,750
Huh? Wait, it's
an anonymous tip.

306
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,208
How am I supposed to
reward them, then?

307
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,708
I think I know a way.

308
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,625

Oh, welcome back.

Ayanokoji! I decided
to get the guys together.

324
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,125
We're having a meeting so we
can pool what we've learned.

Yeah, he's right.

much of anything in here.

You only have the stuff
we were provided.

00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,000
So, Ayanokoji.
Are you a minimalist?

331
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,583
No, I'm not. I just don't
have extra points to burn.

Regarding any witnesses--

346
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,583
I'm leaving.

347
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,541
[KIKYO] Hey, Horikita!
You decided to come after all?

348
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,958
I think it'd be
best for everyone

349
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,541
if you'd share what you know.

350
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:37,500
If you would prefer it, we can
stay quiet and just listen.

351
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,291
You've put in a lot of effort
with minimal results,

352
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,291
so let me offer some intel.

353
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,083
There was a witness.

354
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,500
And, it was someone close.

355
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,416
You know who it is?

356
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,541
One of our classmates,
Sakura, knows something.

357
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:05,500
[phone vibrates]

358
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,375
[KEN panting]

359
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,208
[phone ringing]

360
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,875
What is it that makes you
think Sakura saw anything?

361
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,125
When Kushida made the plea in
class for everyone to help out,

362
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,500
pretty much all of our other
classmates turned to face her.

363
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,541
Sakura, on the other hand,
stared at her desk.

364
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,375
She was the only one, so...

365
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,375
No good. She's not answering.

366
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,583
Aw...

367
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,416
Dammit! I was starting to think

368
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,333
we were gonna get somewhere
with this chick.

369
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,916
But still.

370
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,625
It doesn't even matter if she
is willing to testify or not.

371
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,125
It's not going to make
much of a difference.

372
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,041
The question of whether it
was self-defense or not

373
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,083
is just a minor detail.

374
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,041
In the big picture,
it's nothing.

375
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,750
Haven't you guys
figured that out?

376
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,833
--[KEN] Huh?!
--What do mean by that?

377
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,500
[SUZUNE]
Nothing at all.

378
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,125
Goodbye, now.

379
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,500
[door clicks]

380
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,541
[slams]

381
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,541
[AYANOKOJI]
Sakura, huh.

382
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,791
Honestly, I can't even
remember what she looks like.

383
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,208
[doorbell chimes]

384
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,250
[AYANOKOJI]
Mm?

385
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,250
[AYANOKOJI]
Kushida.

386
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,083
[KIKYO] I haven't been able
to get it out of my head.

387
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,083
I hate to bug you about it,
but do you have any idea

388
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,125
what Horikita was talking
about earlier today?

389
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,291
[AYANOKOJI] Even if Sudo
was acting in self-defense

390
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,750
in the fight, that's not
the root of the problem.

391
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,291
It's a bigger issue
than just that.

392
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,458
[KIKYO]
Huh?

393
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,916
[AYANOKOJI]
Sudo is always talking trash

394
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,583
and being aggressive
towards people.

395
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,416
He lashes out over nothing.

396
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,291
The way he acts inevitably
makes people resent him.

397
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:58,041
He comes off as a jerk
pretty much all the time.

398
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,958
So, hypothetically,
say a murder takes place.

399
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,583
There are two suspects,

400
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,958
one of whom is known to have
committed murder in the past.

401
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,458
Now, imagine the other is a
moral, law-abiding citizen.

402
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,958
Which one of them
would you believe?

403
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:15,291
I guess I'd believe the
law-abiding citizen, honestly.

404
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,458
[AYANOKOJI] But the truth is
that the so-called "good guy"

405
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,875
could be the murderer.

406
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,666
Where there is so little
evidence, people are inclined

407
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,250
to go with what they know from
a person's behavior in the past.

408
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,458
[KIKYO]
So, you're saying that Sudo

409
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,166
kind of brought
this upon himself?

410
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,000
That the way he's acted
since school started

411
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,500
led him to this situation?

412
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,458
[AYANOKOJI] Yes, and Sudo
doesn't get that or think

413
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,208
he's done anything wrong.
Look at Horikita.

414
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,375
That's why she won't
cooperate with us.

415
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,416
But, I still believe we
should make every effort

416
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,083
to help clear Sudo's name.

417
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,375
We wouldn't be good
friends if we didn't.

418
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,083
If you think that's
the right thing to do,

419
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,541
then follow through with it.

420
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,750
I don't believe that that
would be a problem at all.

421
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,583
Right. Not to change
the subject,

422
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,250
but once again you seem
to know everything

423
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,000
about the way Horikita
operates in the world.

424
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,875
I think that might
be going a bit far.

425
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,166
Um. Hey, Ayanokoji.

426
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,375
Do you...

427
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,750
Do you think that...

428
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:13,833
Well, if I... If I were to...

429
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,291
No. Never mind.

430
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,083
As far as stuff
with Sakura goes,

431
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,416
I'll approach her alone tomorrow
and see what she says.

432
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,583
If we all went together,

433
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,708
I think she'd get
intimidated and shut up.

434
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,333
See ya later!

435
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,041
[KIKYO]
Hey, Sakura!

436
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,625
[SAKURA]
Um, yes?

437
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,416
There's something that I've been
wanting to talk to you about.

438
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,791
Do you have a moment?
It's about this thing with Sudo.

439
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,333
Um. I'm sorry but
I can't right now.

440
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,166
There's somewhere
I'm supposed to be.

441
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,416
[KIKYO gasps] It's only
going to take a moment.

442
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,791
This is important!

443
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,041
No, I wasn't there!
I really don't know anything!

444
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,583
[SAKURA gasps]

445
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,458
Oh! Sorry! Are you okay?

446
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,708
Oh, no. It's not turning on.

447
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,833
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!

448
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,375
[SAKURA]
Don't be.

449
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,708
This whole thing was my fault!

450
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,583
Wait, come back!

451
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,500
[SAKURA]
If I get involved,

452
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:30,375
everyone will find out
the truth about me.

453
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,750
No one here can ever know.

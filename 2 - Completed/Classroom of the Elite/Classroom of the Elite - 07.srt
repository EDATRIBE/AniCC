I don't know.

173
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,416
Maybe he's just always
been this weird.

00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,833
[HIDEO]
HQ here, come in.

175
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:12,833
Argos-two.

176
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,458

[clinking]

180
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,666
I'm having major trouble.

181
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,083
A failure like me just isn't cut
out for this kind of work.

182
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,208
I don't think I can do it.

183
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,708

185
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,416
[HIDEO] Faith in yourself,
and in your allies

186
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,208

their faith in you.

187
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,125
Don't stop believing
in the cause.

[CHIHIRO]
I can't! [sighs]

190
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,791
Hey, Yamauchi's been gone
a really long time.

191
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,333
I think we should go out looking
for him now, don't you agree?

192
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,750
Uh. No way!

193
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,958
Don't worry, Kushida.
I'm sure he just got distracted!

194
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,916
[KIKYO] But something bad
could've happened to him.

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,875
Aren't you at least a
little bit concerned?

196
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,875
[IKE]
No, no! I'm sure he's just fine!

197
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,208
But, Ike. He's your
friend, isn't he?

198
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,875
Shouldn't you be
worried about him?

199
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,291
[IKE]
Uh. Wait.

200
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,458
She'll think I'm shallow
if I keep hiding things!

201
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,625
If manga's taught me anything,

202
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,333
it's that chicks love
male friendships.

203
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,000
I can't! If I'm not concerned,
she might hate me!

Forgive me.

213
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,500
I am incompetent.

214
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,916
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,791
[KEN] Apologizing is not going
to fix anything now!

216
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,958
[IKE] I'm sorry. But I
didn't want Kushida

217
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,708
to hate me over this!

218
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,458
[KIKYO] Seriously, guys,
let's go look for him!

219
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,458
Let's all play some volleyball!

220
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,833
Yamauchi's back!

221
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,875
[YAMAUCHI] Wow, the line
for the bathroom was insane!

222
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,208
It was?

223
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,416
Still, I'm relieved you're back.
I was so worried.

224
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,083
So, um, now that Yamauchi's
back in the game,

225
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,458
do you think it
would be okay--

226
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,083
Ah! My stomach's killing me!

227
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,416
I've gotta go to the

Sure thing, boss.

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,625

about done with Phase Two.

236
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,541
I can finish it!

00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,041
You don't have time!
Argos-one, you have to withdraw!

238
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,333
Withdraw, now!

239

[KEN] My leg is cramping!
I've gotta go!

244
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,458
[MAI] That must be an
intense muscle cramp.

00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,541
You're down to five.

246
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,791
Do you want to continue playing,

247
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,583
or should we call
it quits for now?

248
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,625
Uh...

249
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,208
Listen.

250
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,208
I think we should call it and
forfeit this one to you guys.

251
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,250
That way we can go take
care of Ike and Sudo.

[YAMAUCHI] Don't ever
give up on your dreams!

00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,125
I'll play hard enough for
both of them combined.

254
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,750
So, you better not
even think of quitting!

255
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,916
Or are you saying that our
beach volleyball memories

256
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,916
never meant anything
to you at all?!

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,875
Come on, everybody, show me
all the passion and grit

258
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,875
you can muster to
win this thing!

[SAKURA]
Huh...?

260
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,750
[KIKYO] Has Yamauchi always been
this passionate about sports?

261
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,375
I never knew that he had
a distinct personality.

262
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,000
To be honest, I've always
had considerable difficulty

263
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,625
telling him and Ike
apart from each other.

264
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,125
[RYUEN] Huh? There's no one
cleaning these bathrooms.

265
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,375
[IKE]
Setup complete.

266
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,958
Now I've just gotta
get out of here!

267
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,125
[HIDEO] It's too soon to let
your guard down just yet,

268
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,916
Argos-one. There are two
women there with Enemy-R!

269
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,166

270
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,041
I repeat, two women with
the approaching enemy!

[growls] This isn't cool!

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,458
You can't just come
barging in here!

00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,750
The sign clearly says
this place is off-limits!

278
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,416
Then what are you doing here?

279
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,375
You seriously think I care?

280
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,416
I go where I want.

00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,625

What an unsightly scene.

283
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,375
A fight between two

00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,708
You weren't invited.

No thanks.

domesticate you, too.

--[KEN] Huh?

292
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,875
[MANABU]
I am aware that this place

293
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,125
is a recreational facility.

294
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,708
But, that doesn't mean
school rules don't apply.

still on campus.

[SUZUNE] Why do you hide
what you're capable of?

Why, does it irritate you?

304
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,750
Or is it that you just don't
want to lose at anything?

305

[SUZUNE]
Not in the least.

306
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,500
I admire that.

307
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,916
What's the point
in playing a game

308
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,541
if you're not committed to
winning it at all costs?

309
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,750
Being vulnerable and letting
your emotions show

310
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,875
would help you
make friends, too.

311
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,375

I don't need any friends.

Student council president,
Ryuen, and others, too?"

344
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,125
[AYANOKOJI groans]
This is getting ridiculous.

345
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,916
[AYANOKOJI]
Horikita.

346
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,625
I need you to help me with
something important.

347
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,208
Look, I have a
terrible leg cramp!

348
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,708
Stay away from me!

349
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,208
It doesn't look that way to me.

350
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,958
[BOY 7B] Something's
going down over there!

351
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,875
[BOY 7C] Isn't that Horikita
from Class One-D?

352
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,416
[RYUEN]
Horikita?

353
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,208
Give me the names of who
did this, and Al will go easy.

354
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,916
[KOMIYA]
The girl's name is Horikita.

355
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,583
[RYUEN chuckles]

356
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,750
[ALL gasping]

357
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,458
[ICHINOSE] What do you think's
come over Horikita?

358
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,958
I'm just as confused as you.

359
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,666
Why do I even have to
get involved in this?

360
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,125
[inhales, exhales]

361
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,166
Allow me to begin by saying

362
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,375
we are Class-D, year one!

363
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,458
We've been labeled the defective
students at this school.

364
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,333
We're the problem children.

365
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,041
We're fools, and we
fall for the schemes

366
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,041
of other classes pretty easily.

367
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,375
So, to the students of Class C,

368
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,125
you made a bold move in trying
to sabotage our class before.

369
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,333
But now...

370
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,666
...I am grateful for
all of your efforts.

371
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,791
Thanks to you,
everything is clearer.

372
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,125
A class full of defectives
will have a rough time

373
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,666
if we aim high.

374
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,291
But now I see that all classes,
A to D, aren't separated by

375
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,666
anything as simple as
pure academic prowess

376
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,166
or athletic ability.

377
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,458
That's good news.

378
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,416
Especially for loser Class D.

379
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,375
It means we could
become Class A.

380
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,875
We can beat you all and
ascend to the top.

381
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,250
I promise you this:
We will make it to Class A!

382
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,333
[STUDENTS gasp, cheer]

383
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,333
[KIKYO, SAKURA]
Uh?

384
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,958
We love you, Horikita!

385
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:04,916
[KEN]
You're incredible!

386
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,625
[YAMAUCHI]
You rock!

387
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,166
[RYUEN chuckles]

388
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,875
Oh, really, Class D?

389
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,166
[KEN]
You better watch it!

390
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,875
[IKE]
Tidal wave, comin' atcha!

391
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,875
[YAMAUCHI]
Ow, ow, ow.

392
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,000
[SUZUNE]
What a bunch of perverts.

393
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,125
[AYANOKOJI]
Hm?

394
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,541
[SUZUNE]
There really were cameras set up

395
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,750
in the dressing room,
like you said.

396
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,333
[sighs]

397
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,125
[phone ringing]

398
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,208
[AYANOKOJI]
Seriously.

399
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,875
Do you wanna go to
the pool with me?

400
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,458
Absolutely not.

401
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,541
[AYANOKOJI] Look, to be frank,
I need a huge favor from you.

402
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,958
Class D's future is on the line.

403
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,541
How so?

404
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,500
[AYANOKOJI] Ike's the one who
suggested we go to the pool.

405
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,291
He's planning to set up cameras
in the women's dressing room.

406
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,375
So he and the guys can
spy on you all changing.

407
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,625
Uh?

408
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,833
If I had tried to stop them,

409
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,000
they probably would have
gone behind my back.

410
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,291
Found a way to go
forward with it.

411
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,625
It was better to let them
do it and foil them secretly.

412
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,000
[SUZUNE] I hate to admit it,
but you were right.

413
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,833
[AYANOKOJI] Their plan was
to set up the cameras,

414
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,333
then retrieve them later tonight
after everyone had gone home.

415
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,791
But that's not gonna happen now.

416
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,000
We beat them to the chase.

417
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,500
We could have stopped
them earlier.

418
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,416
If we'd removed
the cards in advance.

419
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,250
Then they would have
gotten nothing.

420
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,208
Yeah, that was the
initial plan, actually.

421
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,416
But the interference from
other classes made things

422
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,416
a lot more difficult.

423
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,583
Is that why you made me
give that stupid speech?

424
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,250
To divert people's attention
away from them?

425
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,333
But you got such
thunderous applause.

426
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,458
Sudo and the others were moved
to tears by your words.

427
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,000
More importantly, did you
have fun at the pool today?

428
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,666
You spent your whole
summer alone.

429
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,208
So, was getting out refreshing?

430
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,833
I didn't come to this
school to have fun.

431
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,250
Besides, people bore me.

432
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,041
I have much more fun by myself.

433
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,375
[AYANOKOJI]
Sure you do.

434
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,916
Well, we've got some time
before the pool closes.

435
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,708
[gasps]

436
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,416
[yelps]

437
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,916
[gasps] What is your problem?

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,791
Sorry, I had to do it.

439
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,916
[AYANOKOJI]
Uh!

440
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,125
[splash]

441
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,375
That's payback.

442
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,416
[KIKYO]
Hey! I wanna join in the fun!

443
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,708
[SUZUNE]
Kushida, stop!

444
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,208
We're not playing!

445
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,666
Take that! And that!

446
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,708
[KEN]
Hey, Horikita, check it out!

447
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,583
[BOYS]
Wa-hoo!

448
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,333
[SUZUNE] You idiots stop
splashing my face!

449
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,958
Oh. I'm sorry about that.

450
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,166
[door clicks]

451
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,958
[SUZUNE]
Uh? What's this?

452
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,250
It's less of a risk
to be by myself.

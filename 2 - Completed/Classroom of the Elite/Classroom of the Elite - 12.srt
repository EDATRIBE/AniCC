1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:15,375
[bell ringing]

2
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,083
[IBUKI]
What the--?

3
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,166
[IBUKI]
Ibuki, here.

4
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,208
I've acquired Class D's
card, as directed.

5
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,833
[KATSURAGI]
Right.

6
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,250
Yes.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,041
Yes, I see. We'll meet
up there in a bit.

8
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:17,375
[KATSURAGI] Class A's final
score will be 544 points.

9
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:21,375
That's 350 ahead of Class B.

10
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:24,583
And it beats
Class D's score by...

11
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,250
...an overwhelming number.

12
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:36,625
[SUZUNE gasps]

13
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,958
You're finally awake.

14
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:45,208
[SUZUNE] Where are we?
How did I get here?

15
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,541
And why are we together?

16
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,750
I found you passed out
in the forest.

17
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,958
I picked you up and
brought you here.

18
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,041
[SUZUNE] I chased Ibuki
to where you found me.

19
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,166
She's the one who
took the key card.

20
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,375
But I wasn't able to
get it back from her.

21
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,666
Not in this state.

22
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,166
I see.

23
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,875
[AYANOKOJI]
Horikita, you have to drop out.

24
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,666
[AYANOKOJI] I'll figure out
a way to deal with

25
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,708
Ibuki and the stolen card.

26
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,291
You can't keep this
up any longer.

27
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,708
[SUZUNE]
I won't drop out.

28
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,666
We'll lose more points if I do,
and we can't afford to.

29
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,833
Especially not now.

30
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:23,916
[AYANOKOJI]
Look, you're sick--

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,250
I don't have any
choice in the matter.

32
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,333
If we want to reach Class A.

33
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,250
Don't obsess about that.

34
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,958
It doesn't matter.

35
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,958
I want to show my brother
I'm not a loser.

36
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,500
But will that do you any good?

37
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,875
Do you think it will
change anything?

38
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,875
[SUZUNE] I dunno. But still,
this is all my fault.

39
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:49,500
If I had friends, we could have
carried the card in shifts.

40
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:54,291
But I don't. No one in
class cares about me.

41
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,708
It's all my fault. I'm done for.

42
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,250
[AYANOKOJI] Do you mean to
say that you're starting

43
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,250
to see the value
in having allies?

44
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,333
I won't let this define me.

45
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,333
I swear to you.
I'll make up for it.

46
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,875
I'll do it alone if I must.

47
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,083
You won't be able
to do it alone.

48
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,291
I hate to be the one
to tell you this,

49
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,875
but you aren't strong enough.

50
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,666
Are you saying I should give up?

51
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,375
No, that's not what
I'm trying to say at all.

52
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,208
There's no need to give up.

53
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,708
If you can't win
the battle alone,

54
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,916
then look for others
who can help.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,833
I'll be one of those people.

56
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,875
That's not like you.

57
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:37,083
You're usually so
cryptic, and you...

58
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,125
[AYANOKOJI]
Excuse me, ma'am?

59
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:53,083
[CHABASHIRA]
Horikita. What happened?

60
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,250
[AYANOKOJI]
She's had a bad fever,

61
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,541
and she just passed out
because of it.

62
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,958
She needs to be
somewhere she can rest.

63
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,583
[CHABASHIRA] She'll have
to drop out of the exam.

64
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,750
Do you accept that loss?

65
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,083
[AYANOKOJI]
Yes.

66
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,291
[KARUIZAWA]
I heard that Horikita

67
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,750
dropped out of the test.

68
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,625
[SATO]
Ibuki's gone missing, too.

69
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,291
Do you think she was responsible
for the arson after all?

70
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,458
But, why would she be?

71
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,250
I mean, what would
that even accomplish?

72
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,000
Wait, do you think Ibuki could
have been Class C's leader?

73
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,500
I have no idea.

74
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,791
But everyone else in Class C
dropped out, right?

75
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,125
By now, their leader
must be gone.

76
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,000
[HIRATA]
Our key card was stolen?

77
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,333
Yeah.

78
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,708
But I haven't told anyone
else anything about it.

79
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,333
This confirms that Ibuki
was sent to find our leader.

80
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,375
As for the underwear theft,

81
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,583
we can assume that was also her.

82
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,916
Why would she do that?

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,500
No, there's no use in
trying to figure out why.

84
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,916
What we need to be concerned
with now is tomorrow,

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,458
when they name our leader,
and we lose those points.

86
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,041
[AYANOKOJI]
The penalty from our drop-outs

87
00:04:56,125 --> 00:05:00,000
and having our leader guessed
is a total loss of 110 S-points.

88
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,666
The fact that they know
our leader will negate

89
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,791
all our bonus points, too.

90
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,458
[HIRATA] And that will leave us
with only about 50 S-points.

91
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,208
After the test
results are revealed,

92
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,875
it won't take long for people
to start blaming each other.

93
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,541
[AYANOKOJI] Yeah, might devolve
into a bit of a witch hunt.

94
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,750
[HIRATA]
You know.

95
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,000
I thought this exam
would give us the chance

96
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,208
we needed to bring
our class together.

97
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,791
I thought that, if we could
unify and do our best,

98
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:30,041
that it might help forge
bonds between all of us.

99
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,416
But, no.

100
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,583
The reverse happened,

101
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,125
and this could be
the end of Class D.

102
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:43,250
[AYANOKOJI] Hirata. I have
a little favor to ask of you.

103
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,875
[MASHIMA]
Before the test officially ends,

104
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,875
take a few moments
to name who you think

105
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,291
the other class leaders are.

106
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,666
[STUDENT 12A]
I haven't seen Kaneda...

107
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,791
[HOSHINOMIYA]
All right, guys.

108
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,458
Write down on this
form who you suspect

109
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,166
the other class leaders are.

110
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,416
If you don't have any idea,
then leave it blank,

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,375
just to be safe.

112
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,791
[chuckles] That makes sense.

113
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,375
Should I just leave
it blank, then?

114
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,916
Each wrong guess
costs us 50 points.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,500
I don't see any need to risk it.

116
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,708
Good call.

117
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,250
We have more than
200 points, anyway.

118
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,000
[SAKURA]
Um, hi.

119
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,833
The test is finally over.

120
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,541
Yeah. It's finally over.

121
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,458
Do you have any idea
what our final score

122
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,458
on the exam will turn out to be?

123
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,000
There was that thing
with Ibuki, you know?

124
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:37,625
[MASHIMA] Right! All
remaining classes are here.

125
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,541
I formally declare
the test complete.

126
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,375
All scores are in,
and everything's final.

127
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,791
[RYUEN]
Hey.

128
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,250
You wouldn't say goodbye
without me, would you?

129
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,833
[ICHINOSE]
What's Ryuen doing here?

130
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,791
[KANZAKI] You mean he stayed
on the island, after all?

131
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,208
[KEN]
Ryuen's here, but Ibuki's not?

132
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,875
[KARUIZAWA]
Yeah, why is that?

133
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,541
[KATSURAGI]
You did an excellent job, Ryuen.

134
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,875
You helped Class A earn
over 500 S-points.

135
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,583
Allow me to offer a hand in
gratitude for your hard work.

136
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,333
Just wait.

137
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,833
You're all about to witness
something very interesting.

138
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,083
[KATSURAGI]
What do you mean by that?

139
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,333
[KATSURAGI] If we hang
a curtain over the entrance

140
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,500
to the cave, and hide
everything in there,

141
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,833
then the other classes won't
have a clue what we're doing.

142
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,666
This is a bold plan
you've conceived.

143
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,083
Very risky.

144
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,541
And it's the only way
I'll apply myself.

145
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,708
The school can shove its test.

146
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,875
I absolutely abhor hard work.

147
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,458
[RYUEN] On the first day
of the special exam.

148
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,041
I forged a contract
with Class A.

149
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,583
Class C would buy and
transfer 200 S-points'

150
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,833
worth of goods to Class A.

151
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,833
And, I would give any
information Class C

152
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,666
collected on the other
class leaders to Katsuragi.

153
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,041
Regarding the other leaders.

154
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,541
I will need more than just
your word on their identity.

155
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,583
I need you to show me a
photo of their key card.

156
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,291
That, or get me the card itself.

157
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,333
Right. Sure thing, man.

158
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,750
One thing though,
when you form an alliance

159
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,250
with someone, shouldn't
you trust them?

160
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:18,333
[RYUEN] That's right.
I need you to truly hate me.

161
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,750
'Cause If you don't...

162
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,500
...you won't fool anyone.

163
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,208
Take a hike.

164
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,416
[RYUEN] Next, I sent Ibuki
and Kaneda to work as spies.

165
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,916
Ibuki in Class D,
and Kaneda in Class B.

166
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,666
[RYUEN]
Then came the revelry.

167
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,250
[RYUEN] We spent all 100
of the S-points we had left

168
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,958
after the trade with Class A.

169
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,500
Then I had everyone except

170
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:55,333
Kaneda and Ibuki drop out.
I alone remained.

171
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,458
I went into hiding,
deep in the jungle.

172
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:04,250
[chuckles] You must really
hate Katsuragi, am I right?

173
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,333
[RYUEN] I was working with
Sakayanagi's faction

174
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,375
from Class A, too.
One of the guys in that camp

175
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,666
was intentionally abusing
a spot on the island

176
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,458
to reduce his own
class's points.

177
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,625
He was human garbage,
but remarkably forthright.

178
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,333
Enough to tell me who
his class leader was.

179
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,208
[RYUEN] What I hadn't
planned for was Ibuki's

180
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,458
digital camera breaking.

181
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,666
It was an unfortunate
kink in the works,

182
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,708
and forced Katsuragi
and me to verify

183
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,000
Class D's key card in person.

184
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,291
[KATSURAGI]
It's genuine. Good job.

185
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,875
Your obligation is complete.

186
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,750
Care to know who
Class B's leader is?

187
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,291
Naturally, B holds
their cards close.

188
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,000
So all evidence is
purely circumstantial.

189
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,291
Unless you have verifiable
proof, I don't care.

190
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,625
Ryuen, you smell
like a dead animal.

191
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:57,041
Take a shower, set yourself
on fire, whatever works.

192
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,875
[SAKAGAMIAKANE]
Ryuen. Are you there?

193
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,083
[RYUEN]
Is the test finally over?

194
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,375
[SAKAGAMIAKANE]
Kaneda and Ibuki

195
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,458
have dropped out as well.

196
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,708
[RYUEN]
I see.

197
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,833
[SAKAGAMIAKANE]
Anyway. Let's close this out.

198
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,500
Of course.

199
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:40,083
[RYUEN] Class A's leader
is Yahiko Totsuka.

200
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,041
B's is Chihiro Shiranami.

201
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,541
D's is Suzune Horikita.

202
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,416
[SAKAGAMIAKANE] Honestly now,
you say that you hate it.

203
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,666
Any kind of exertion
or hard work.

204
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,166
But, look at you.

205
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,958
You're like a soldier who's
just fought an epic battle.

206
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,250
You're dirty, injured.

207
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,166
The others talk about
your determination

208
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,500
in seeking victory.

209
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,250
Why don't you quit your
babbling already, teacher.

210
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,541
Now that I've guessed
every class's leader,

211
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,041
that will subtract 50 points
from each of their scores

212
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,958
and negate their bonus points.

213
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,708
Class A will only gain
a paltry 170 points

214
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,083
from this test.

215
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,875
As for Class C's points--

216
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,791
150 just from
naming the leaders.

217
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,375
Combine that with
the points we gained

218
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,708
from securing spots, and we'll
beat Class A, for sure.

219
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,750
[RYUEN]
That means I win again.

220
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,916
[MASHIMA]
And now, the time has come.

221
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I will reveal the results
of the special examination.

222
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:40,125
[MASHIMA] Coming in last:
Class C, with zero points.

223
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,833
[RYUEN]
What?

224
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,625
[MASHIMA]
Next, in third place: Class A,

225
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,416
with 120 points.

226
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,083
In second: Class B.

227
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,625
One hundred and forty points.

228
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,916
Finally, in first
place: Class D,

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,625
with 225 points.

230
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,000
[gasps] First place?

231
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,708
Huh, really?

232
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,166
[IKE]
We did it!

233
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:08,166
[CLASS D cheering]

234
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,083
What on earth?

235
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,958
How could that have happened?

236
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,916
[KOENJI laughs]

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,958
Well then, it looks like

238
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,583
you had a great time
on the island.

239
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:32,041
[KOENJI laughs]

240
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,166
Shut your mouth, Koenji!

241
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,291
You realize that we
lost 30 whole point

242
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,458
because of you, right?

243
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,458
[laughs] Oh, just calm down.

244
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,000
I was laid up with a very
nasty cold, my good man.

245
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,750
What was I supposed to do?

246
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,708
You damn vain punk.
Cut it out!

247
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,125
Dry off and stop glistening!

248
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,541
[CLASS clammoring]

249
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,666
[SUZUNE]
Wait up!

250
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,500
You better tell me exactly
what's going on here.

251
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,791
[SAKAYANAGI]
It all played out more or less

252
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,750
the way I expected it would.

253
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,833
The Katsuragi
faction is finished,

254
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,458
or they'll lose a great deal
of influence, at least.

255
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,791
That's right.

256
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,750
And if we're united going
into the second term,

257
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,458
then Class A is going
to be unstoppable.

258
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,041
[HASHIMOTO] Katsuragi's here,
so I'd better hang up.

259
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,958
[SAKAYANAGI]
Yes. Again, nice work.

260
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,166
[STUDENT 12C]
How are you going to atone

261
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,250
for this one, Katsuragi?

262
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,166
[STUDENT 12D]
Signing that contract

263
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,416
was an enormous mistake!

264
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,666
[YAHIKO] Don't forget
every single one of you

265
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,708
signed off on it, too!

266
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,416
[HASHIMOTO] This is just
pathetic, Katsuragi.

267
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,791
Hashimoto.

268
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,750
How dare you criticize Katsuragi

269
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,291
when you're probably
the reason we failed!

270
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,500
I don't know what you did,
but why don't you try going to--

271
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,416
Hashimoto.

272
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,666
You spoke to Ryuen, did you not?

273
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,416
I know you sold the name
of Class A's leader

274
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,458
to that opportunistic scumbag.

275
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,041
[HASHIMOTO chuckles]

276
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,250
[KANZAKI]
Second place, huh?

277
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:18,291
[chuckles] Yeah it is still
a loss, unfortunately.

278
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:22,583
Class D really was the only
clear winner in this exam.

279
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,375
Hey. Remember the first day?

280
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,583
What the teacher told us?
She said to keep in mind

281
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,666
anything in this school
can be bought with points.

282
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,125
[KANZAKI]
Yeah. I do recall that.

283
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,041
[ICHINOSE]
It may be really expensive,

284
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,083
but it can still be bought.

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,708
You can be in any
class you want,

286
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,625
if you pay the price.

287
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,666
I apologize.

288
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,250
[RYUEN]
Well. I've figured it out.

289
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,958
The reason they got
that high score,

290
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,666
and why our score
ended up being zero.

291
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,166
[RYUEN] It's because we
guessed it incorrectly.

292
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,541
Class D's leader.

293
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,875
What?

294
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,291
Well, you weren't our
leader anymore, Horikita.

295
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,125
Wh-What? But the card!

296
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,666
[SUZUNE] What the...?
What's your name doing on it?

297
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,083
Just before the test ended,

298
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,041
I had Class D's leader changed.

299
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,416
[gasps]

300
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,750
You can't just change leaders,

301
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,000
unless you've got
a really good reason.

302
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,833
Which obviously means, if you
do have a really good reason,

303
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,833
you are allowed to switch.

304
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,791
[AYANOKOJI]
Our leader's health was failing.

305
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,791
That's as good a reason as any.

306
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,083
Because of that,
when Ryuen and Katsuragi

307
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,541
named you class D's leader,
they were wrong.

308
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,208
It was me.

309
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,000
Wait, you conceived
of this whole plan

310
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,958
by yourself, didn't you?

311
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,666
Yeah, I did.

312
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,500
[AYANOKOJI]
I knew Ibuki was a spy,

313
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,041
so I destroyed
her digital camera.

314
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,041
That meant she would have
to steal the key card itself,

315
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,875
which would be much harder
than taking a picture of it.

316
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,333
[AYANOKOJI] Then I waited
until your condition

317
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,750
had sufficiently deteriorated.

318
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,250
[AYANOKOJI] I promise to give
you Sakura's email address,

319
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,583
but you've gotta
do something for me.

320
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,041
Ah?!

321
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,583
[AYANOKOJI]
I got you to show me your card

322
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,416
while Ibuki was watching,
staged a distraction,

323
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,041
got you to go to the waterfall.

324
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,666
And thus, Ibuki was lured
into stealing your key card.

325
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,041
[AYANOKOJI]
Then, I started the fire

326
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,916
to throw the camp into chaos.

327
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,125
Giving Ibuki the opening
she needed to escape.

328
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,458
I knew their plan had
always been for her

329
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,625
to sneak away from the camp
and show Ryuen the card.

330
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,333
Then you convinced me
that I should drop out,

331
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,583
and made yourself the leader.

332
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,583
Yeah, but that came later.

333
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,083
At first, I'd planned
to amass points

334
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,708
by occupying all the spots.

335
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,333
But then I saw Katsuragi leaving

336
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,166
one of the spots with Class A's
key card in his hand.

337
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,583
[SUZUNE] So, that means
Class A's leader was Katsuragi?

338
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,875
[AYANOKOJI] No. Katsuragi
is a cautious person.

339
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,083
He would never do
anything that careless.

340
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,833
He wouldn't even occupy
a spot when someone

341
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,708
might be around to see him.

342
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,583
It was just a performance
to hide the truth.

343
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,291
That someone else
had occupied the spot,

344
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,125
without checking it
in with him first.

345
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,875
That's how I was able to infer

346
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,500
that Class A's leader
was in fact Yahiko,

347
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,291
who was with Katsuragi
at the time I saw him.

348
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,166
And as for Class C,
I was well aware

349
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,916
that Ryuen had never
actually left the island.

350
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,875
[AYANOKOJI] When we went
to pay Ryuen a visit,

351
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,583
he had a two-way radio
on the table next to him.

352
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,041
Ibuki was in possession
of one just like it.

353
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,208
If Ryuen was indeed
still in contact

354
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:57,166
with Ibuki that way, it meant he
still had to be on the island.

355
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,458
After that, I was certain
that Ryuen was Class C's leader.

356
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,500
That's what made me
change my tactics.

357
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,583
I switched from a spot
occupation strategy

358
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,541
to a leader
identification strategy,

359
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,875
and used you as a pawn.

360
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,708
But I left Class B alone.

361
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,708
I determined eroding
our friendly alliance

362
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,750
with them would be detrimental
to us in the long run.

363
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,833
And, to be honest,

364
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,875
there was already
a spy in Class B.

365
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,958
So, I knew that their
leader would be revealed,

366
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,458
even without any
action on my part.

367
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,375
And you surmised correctly.

368
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,041
Their leader was identified,
costing them serious points.

369
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,083
Yes, if another class
guesses your leader,

370
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,083
it costs you 50 points,
and all your bonus points

371
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,208
are negated, as well.

372
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,083
You really put one over
on everyone this time.

373
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,500
But, I don't get it.

374
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,916
You claim to have no interest
in ascending to Class A,

375
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,125
so why did you help me?

376
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,041
I can't figure out
what motivates you.

377
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,041
Why do you do it?

378
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,208
[HIRATA]
There she is! Horikita!

379
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,416
We've been looking
everywhere for you!

380
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,000
How did you do it?

381
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,583
We heard that you're the only
reason Class D won this thing!

382
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,583
Hirata told us
everything you did!

383
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,166
He said that you're
the one who figured out

384
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,791
who Class A and C's leaders
were. That's awesome!

385
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,708
[MATSUSHITA] Thanks to you,
we've got tons of points now!

386
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,958
[SATO]
You're amazing! What a genius!

387
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,291
--You guys, wait.
--[SHINO] Ibuki was the one

388
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,958
who started the fire,
and when she ran away,

389
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,333
you chased her in
the rain, right?

390
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,500
--[SUZUNE] Um, well.
--[MATSUSHITA] And he told us

391
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,875
that's the reason you're
under the weather!

392
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,500
[SATO] So cool! You're the
best friend ever!

393
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,000
Friend? What are
you talking about?

394
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,208
Horikita sure is popular, huh?

395
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,000
[AYANOKOJI]
Yeah, I guess so.

396
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,625
I really do hate her.

397
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,833
Because, for better
or for worse,

398
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,708
she has nothing to hide.

399
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,500
She and I are opposites. So...

400
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,875
Well, most people
are more like you.

401
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,416
Me, included.

402
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,208
[KIKYO]
Hey, Ayanokoji?

403
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,875
[AYANOKOJI]
What is it?

404
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,291
[KIKYO] If you had to
make a choice, like,

405
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,250
who you would be with...

406
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,166
You would choose
Horikita, wouldn't you?

407
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,083
[AYANOKOJI]
I don't know.

408
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,208
Meanie.

409
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,458
[phone chimes]

410
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,125
[CHABASHIRA] First, please
allow me to congratulate you.

411
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,291
I am genuinely impressed.

412
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,625
Oh, so now you're satisfied?

413
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,541
Then tell me something.

414
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,416
Is it true that an
outsider attempted

415
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,208
to get me expelled,
or did you make that part up?

416
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,250
[CHABASHIRA]
Hm.

417
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,166
I won't play this game,
and I refuse

418
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,833
to do anything else for
you until I have proof.

419
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,125
Have you forgotten that I know

420
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,041
every little thing
about you? Come on, now.

421
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,625
Don't you think that
that's proof enough?

422
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,958
[CHABASHIRA]
Icarus' wings.

423
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,083
What about 'em?

424
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,083
[CHABASHIRA] Icarus wanted
to fly in order to be free.

425
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,291
But he only did it because
his father taught him

426
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,666
how to make the wings
and take flight.

427
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,375
He couldn't have done it alone.

428
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,666
The poor boy wasn't
flying of his own accord.

429
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,791
Now, don't you think that
sounds a little bit familiar?

430
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,583
That man who called me,

431
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,500
who I am sure you've figured
out by now is your father,

432
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,708
said, "Someday, Kiyotaka will
choose to leave the school

433
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,791
of his own accord."

434
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,041
Fly too close, and you'll
burn your wings,

435
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,875
then plunge into
the sea and drown.

436
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,208
We both know that won't happen.

437
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,541
Poor, little Icarus.

438
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:34,166
What will your next move
in our little game be?

439
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,208
I think you know
the answer to that.

440
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:41,708
"Poor" Icarus? He didn't
heed Daedalus' warnings.

441
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,125
[IBUKI]
You would have gotten

442
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,666
hundreds of thousands of points
every month until graduation?

443
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,166
From the very beginning,
that contract was

444
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,083
the only thing I was after.

445
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,791
The bonus points were
just a part of that goal.

446
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,166
However,

447
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,250
I don't like it when people
try to get in the way

448
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,958
of what I want.

449
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,333
[RYUEN]
Class D.

450
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,375
[sighs]

451
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,041
[SUZUNE] I... I've been
looking all over for you.

452
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,041
Oh, it's you again.

453
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,583
What do you want this time?

454
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,791
I heard from Hirata.

455
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,375
When you said who Class A
and C's leaders were,

456
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,583
you also told him I was the one
who figured the whole thing out.

457
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,750
[AYANOKOJI huffs]

458
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,583
[SUZUNE] And then after
the test was over,

459
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,750
you asked him to do something

460
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,666
to bring the class
back together.

461
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,333
Are you trying to use me
as some kind of cover?

462
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,583
Horikita, remember
what I said to you

463
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:46,291
a long time ago? I told you
that you need allies.

464
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,791
Is that why you
did all of this?

465
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm finally starting to see
a real change in you.

466
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,583
Why's it always your fault?

467
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,458
Look, I acknowledge
that we are allies,

468
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,750
but I'll only do it grudgingly,
so don't get any ideas, okay?

469
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,750
And you better not act like
we're all buddy-buddy

470
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,416
once we get back
to school, or trust me,

471
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,250
there'll be hell to pay!

472
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,000
It's just for our goals.

473
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,125
We're working together
to get to Class A!

474
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,208
But...

475
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,708
Despite that,
I have to tell you.

476
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,500
Thanks for your help.

477
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,916
Not that I need you or anything.
I am fine without you!

478
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,666
[AYANOKOJI]
But, Horikita.

479
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,041
I've never considered
you an ally.

480
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,041
Not even for a second.

481
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,333
Not you. Not Kushida.
Not Hirata.

482
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,791
People are nothing
but tools to me.

483
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,791
All of them. I don't care
what I have to do to win.

484
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:47,916
[AYANOKOJI] I don't care
what I have to sacrifice.

485
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,375
In this world,
winning is everything.

486
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,208
[AYANOKOJI] And in the end,
I'm going to win.

487
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,583
[AYANOKOJI]
That's all that matters.

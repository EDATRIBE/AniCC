1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:15,416
[bell ringing]

2
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,208
[HIRATA] First, let's go over
what we already know.

3
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,958
The school provided two tents
that each sleep eight,

4
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:34,833
so we have some shelter, two
flashlights, one box of matches,

5
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,458
backpacks, and amenities
for everyone in class.

6
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,083
And sunscreen for
anyone who wants it.

7
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,208
A whole week with
only the basics?

8
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,541
A survival test on a
desert island, for real?

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,833
Just proceed as we discussed.

10
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,208
Right.

11
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,291
And get over yourself, too.

12
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,458
We both know that ever since
the rumor went around

13
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,250
that you tried get into
the student council

14
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,583
and got rejected,

15
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,458
Sakayanagi's faction has
achieved dominance.

16
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:13,083
This is a great opportunity
for the both of us.

17
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,458
[HIRATA] So, we have
to find our own food.

18
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,250
A test of survival, outdoors.

19
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,875
Ending at noon,
one week from now.

20
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,250
[YAMAUCHI] But remember
what the teachers told us?

21
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,500
We can still go swimming,
have barbecues,

22
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,875
and all that other fun stuff.

23
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,708
[HIRATA] No, we can only
do that if we spend

24
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,208
the 300 S-points they gave us,
which would be a waste,

25
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,250
considering what we could buy.

26
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,250
Food, drinking water,
tools to cook with.

27
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,250
So you aren't gonna
buy those things?

28
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,000
Look, if we have any S-points
left at the end of the test,

29
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,625
then they'll be added to our
class's total point score.

30
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,083
If we can tough it out
for the whole week,

31
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,541
we'll get 30,000 a month!

32
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,083
Thirty thousand, guys!

33
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,541
[KARUIZAWA]
What's that?

34
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,666
[HIRATA] A list of things
we could lose points for.

35
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,958
Illness and serious injuries.

36
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,541
Pollution of the
surrounding environment.

37
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,208
Absence at morning
and evening roll calls.

38
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,916
Violence against, or stealing
from other classes.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,458
[KARUIZAWA] But we can gain
more points, can't we?

40
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,708
[HIRATA]
Yes.

41
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,083
There are certain "spots"
around the island

42
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,541
we can claim as our own
to get bonus points.

43
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,541
"Freedom to choose,"
is the theme of this test.

44
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,541
Don't ya think?

45
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,916
Sure seems that way.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,833
If we do this right,
we could close the gap

47
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,833
between us and
the other classes.

48
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,541
This thing is so restrictive.

49
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,125
But there's a penalty
for removing the ID watches.

50
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,083
I don't think it's wise
to risk it, y'know?

51
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,333
There are special sensors
and GPS devices

52
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,166
hidden in these things.

53
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,458
So they can find us quickly
if there's an emergency, I bet.

54
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,375
Hey, Hirata, don't
you think we should

55
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,958
be able to spend some of
our points, within reason?

56
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,083
[HIRATA]
Hm...

57
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,625
No!

58
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,458
We should refrain from using
points for as long as we can.

59
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,083
Don't you realize how
difficult that's going to be?

60
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,583
[SHINO] Are we supposed to
go to the bathroom in this?

61
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,708
[SATO]
I'll, like, die!

62
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,708
[HIRATA]
A basic toilet?

63
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,541
I'd prefer to tough it out.

64
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,000
That won't be a problem
for me, personally,

65
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,208
but I don't think some
of the other girls can.

66
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,750
[AYANOKOJI]
A basic toilet.

67
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,208
You use a hyper-absorbent
polymer sheet to solidify waste.

68
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,166
Each one can be used many times.

69
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,708
I think.

70
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,416
That might be hard on the women.

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,875
[SUZUNE]
That's very likely.

72
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,583
Come on, we can just tough
it out and use this toilet!

73
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,791
You're not listening!

74
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,041
I'm saying that
some of the girls

75
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,250
might not be willing
or able to do that!

76
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,625
We can buy a regular
toilet with points.

77
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,916
See, it says so right
here on the list.

78
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:25,875
[KARUIZAWA]
That's perfect!

79
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:26,750
[HASE]
Yeah!

80
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,666
[SATO]
We totally have to!

81
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,791
[SHINO]
Let's buy it right now!

82
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,541
[YUKIMURA]
You can't just decide that.

83
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,291
We shouldn't be able to
spend collective points

84
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,750
without a majority vote.

85
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,166
[YAMAUCHI]
A majority vote!

86
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,375
That's a great idea, Yukimura!

87
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,041
[IKE] This is our chance to
score some major class points!

88
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,000
We can do without
the fancy toilet.

89
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,000
What the--?

90
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,416
Women are emotional creatures

91
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,375
who become irrational
when they get triggered,

92
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,833
so you shouldn't
indulge them, Hirata.

93
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,125
Say that again, jerk!

94
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,333
Hey, relax. Do you wanna
prove the guy right?

95
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,583
[SATO] Think about it from
our perspective for a minute!

96
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,541
[SHINO] I'm not gonna go
to the bathroom where...

97
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,083
This doesn't bode well.

98
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,333
This test is shaping up to be

99
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,583
much more complicated
than I thought.

100
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,750
I don't know if we can cut it.

101
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,625
[AYANOKOJI] Ike, Yamauchi,
and Sudo went on an expedition.

102
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,875
They're looking for
a place to camp,

103
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,166
and any of those "spots"
that were mentioned.

104
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,291
[AYANOKOJI]
You're not having a good time?

105
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,500
[SUZUNE]
This isn't exactly my forte.

106
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,375
On many levels:
for one, roughing it.

107
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,416
And, two, having to
be around people.

108
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
[AYANOKOJI]
I can understand that.

109
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,625
Even though it pains me,
I guess I've got to admit

110
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,000
the hypothesis you posed
to me once upon a time

111
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,000
was eerily accurate.

112
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,750
This school will
test us on a metric

113
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,791
involving more than academics.

114
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,375
That's what you said to me.

115
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,625
Yeah.

116
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,250
Ike and Sudo volunteered
to go explore the forest

117
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,708
in search of a camp site.

118
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,541
I wouldn't even know
how to handle that.

119
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:51,916
Are you going to be okay,
despite everything?

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,750
[SUZUNE]
Doesn't matter.

121
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,625
If Classes A and B are
searching for these "spots,"

122
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,708
we would be wise to do
the same. Don't you think?

123
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,625
[AYANOKOJI] Aiming for a higher
class is harder than I thought.

124
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,833
[SUZUNE] Well, yeah, but don't
you want what it offers?

125
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,125
[AYANOKOJI]
What do ya mean?

126
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,500
[SUZUNE]
The guarantee you'll get the job

127
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,291
or university you want.

128
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,291
I assumed that anyone
who came to this school

129
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,541
did so because they wanted that.

130
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,916
[HIRATA]
A class of more than 20 people.

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,750
An unfamiliar basic toilet.

132
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,250
You really think there
won't be any trouble?

133
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,833
We'll just have to
make the best of it all.

134
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,291
Sharing a primitive toilet

135
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,875
is guaranteed to
bring up problems.

136
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,583
I think spending
points in moderation

137
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,166
is the best course of action.

138
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,083
Reckless self-deprivation
and uncertainty

139
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:42,166
will stress everyone out,
which increases conflict.

140
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,583
Not to mention
the hygiene issues.

141
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,375
The girls need peace of mind.

142
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:50,791
It will make them more likely
to succeed in the exam. Y'know?

143
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,291
Yeah, you're right.

144
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:56,166
[AYANOKOJI] He would never
argue against solid logic.

145
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,458
I think it's time for us
to start searching the forest

146
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,791
for a good place to
set up our base camp.

147
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,500
I agree.

148
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,208
[HIRATA] Where we decide
to camp will definitely

149
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:08,083
affect how and when we have
to spend our points this week.

150
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,416
Are there any volunteers
to help me search?

151
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,625
Oh, right here!

152
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,000
I'd be honored to help,
if you'll have me!

153
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,375
Aren't you going
to join the fun?

154
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,958
That's the last
thing I wanna do.

155
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,000
And you?

156
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,875
Volunteering to help
those guys look?

157
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,625
I've gotta say,
I'm quite surprised.

158
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,583
Not taking any kind of role

159
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,833
makes you stand out
from the group.

160
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,541
[HIRATA] Thanks a lot,
Sakura. That makes nine.

161
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,750
Let's proceed in teams of three.

162
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:55,041
[KOENJI laughs]

163
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,083
Ah, yes, I am so beautiful.

164
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,375
And melding with the exquisite
environment around me

165
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,541
only enhances my stellar looks.

166
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,250
I'm the pinnacle of beauty.

167
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,916
[AYANOKOJI] Excellent athletic
ability, and no sign

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,375
of reticence about
the outdoors, either.

169
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,458
What's his story?

170
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:15,416
[SAKURA] Ayanokoji.
Walking in this jungle.

171
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,166
It's pretty difficult, isn't it?

172
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,291
[AYANOKOJI] Yes, and it's
incredibly hot, on top of that.

173
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,083
Hey, are you gonna be okay?

174
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,416
I'm fine. Don't worry!

175
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,416
Well, that's good.

176
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Let's pick up the pace.

177
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,916
Uh, yeah.

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,791
Koenji sure is amazing, right?

179
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,833
[AYANOKOJI] Yeah, and it's
not just his athleticism.

180
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,333
He's insanely confident
all the time, too.

181
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,666
Koenji, wait! Don't go
too fast, please.

182
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,875
[KOENJI]
No need to worry.

183
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:47,166
A little jungle like this
is no match for me!

184
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,958
What's that supposed to mean?

185
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,125
As long as the sun
is still shining,

186
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,000
there's very little
chance of getting lost

187
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,458
while wandering around
a forest like this one.

188
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,666
It's intriguing.

189
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,833
That's why I'm having
the time of my life!

190
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,958
[AYANOKOJI]
He keeps speeding up.

191
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,791
Koenji.

192
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,833
[SAKURA pants] Don't worry
about me, really. I'm okay.

193
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,041
[AYANOKOJI sighs]
Huh, lost sight of him again.

194
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,750
I wonder how fast that guy was
flying through the tree tops.

195
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,875
It's crazy.

196
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,250
Do you think this
is one of the paths?

197
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,333
[AYANOKOJI]
It certainly looks like it.

198
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,625
[SAKURA gasps]
Wow.

199
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,708
I wonder if that cave is one
of the spots they mentioned.

200
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,541
Most likely.

201
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,041
[CHABASHIRA]
There are multiple "spots"

202
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,708
scattered throughout the island.

203
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,458
Each time you gain possession
of one of these spots.

204
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,333
You will earn a single
bonus point for your class.

205
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,958
However, you can't
spend any bonus points

206
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,458
during the test period.

207
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,166
They'll be added
to your class total

208
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,458
after the test has finished.

209
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,666
Each declaration of
possession of a spot

210
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,416
lasts for eight hours.

211
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,375
Only the class leader
has the authority

212
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,791
to declare possession.

213
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,166
You said class leader?

214
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,625
That's right.

215
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,250
This key card is used to
take possession of a spot.

216
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,291
Only the leader gets one.

217
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,166
Also, you can't change leaders

218
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,750
without having a legitimate
reason to do so.

219
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,708
In addition to that,

220
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,875
on the last day of the test,
when we take roll,

221
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,833
for each class leader you are
able to correctly identify,

222
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,500
your class will be
allotted a whopping

223
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,791
50 bonus points,
right then and there.

224
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,541
[SAKURA]
Fifty bonus points?

225
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,416
[KEN] So if we guess all
three classes' leaders,

226
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,208
we'll get 150 bonus points?

227
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,416
However, for each
incorrect guess,

228
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,250
you'll lose 50 points.

229
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,833
This is a high-risk,
high-return game.

230
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,041
It's in your best interest
to try to find out

231
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,000
who the other class leaders are,
but also to make an effort

232
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,041
to conceal your
leader's identity.

233
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,708
[AYANOKOJI]
Spots are important, I guess,

234
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,500
but moving too hastily
to secure them

235
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,166
could result in your
leader being revealed.

236
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
[gasps]

237
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,958
[YAHIKO] We sure got lucky
this time, right, Katsuragi?

238
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,500
Securing a spot like this
so early in the week?

239
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,250
Lucky?

240
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,666
I've had my eye on it
since before we landed.

241
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,875
Finding it was expected.

242
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,333
Another thing. Be careful
what you say and do.

243
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,375
Oh, right.

244
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,125
We don't know who might be
eavesdropping out here.

245
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,458
So, take extra care not to
accidentally reveal anything.

246
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,458
As leader, it's
my responsibility

247
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,000
to manage our class.

248
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,083
Yeah. I'll be careful.

249
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,958
Before we docked today,

250
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,750
the ship took a slow lap around
the island at a distance.

251
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,416
That was a hint.

252
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
[YAHIKO]
How was that a hint?

253
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,125
Even from that far away,

254
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,000
I could see there were paths
cut through the jungle.

255
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,916
Then I knew I just had to
find the shortest routes.

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,333
You could tell what the school

257
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,166
was trying to do just from
that? Brilliant, as usual.

258
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,250
You know what?

259
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,125
Sakayanagi's got nothin'
on you, dude.

260
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,750
Hold on for a second.
Something's odd.

261
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,666
What is it, Katsuragi?

262
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,291
Um. What's up?

263
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,500
Nothing. Let's get moving.

264
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,583
We shouldn't stay here too long.

265
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,333
[AYANOKOJI]
That was a close call.

266
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,666
[AYANOKOJI]
Sorry, Sakura.

267
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,458
Sakura?

268
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,458
[SAKURA groans]

269
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,208
[AYANOKOJI]
Are you okay?

270
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,666
I-I-I-I-I'm--

271
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,375
I'm okay.

272
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,458
[AYANOKOJI]
Those two guys.

273
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,166
They're in Class A, right?

274
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,125
[SAKURA]
Uh, yeah.

275
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,916
Hey, Ayanokoji?

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,166
Does that conversation
mean that bald guy

277
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,625
is Class A's leader?

278
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,625
So, we just learned an
invaluable secret, didn't we?

279
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,958
[AYANOKOJI]
Yeah.

280
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,375
I'll report it to Hirata later,
when we get back.

281
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,333
He ditched you?
Well, that's Koenji.

282
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,458
Yeah.

283
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,083
And it's not like
I have the ability

284
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,916
to control a person like that.

285
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,416
As I'm sure you're aware.

286
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,750
[HIRATA] Good news, everybody!
Ike and the others.

287
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,458
They found a great spot
at the head of a river!

288
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,375
Why don't we go
meet up with them!

289
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,833
This is it!

290
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,166
Don't you think it's
the best spot ever?

291
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,166
[KARUIZAWA gasps]
The water's so clear!

292
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,708
--[HIRATA] Thanks, you guys.
--[KIKYO] It's beautiful!

293
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,333
[SHINO] It's a lot
cooler than I thought!

294
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,916
[HIDEO]
You think we can drink it?

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,125
I know!

296
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,208
There it is.

297
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,416
Useless to me.

298
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,541
Only the class leader can take
possession of a spot. Huh.

299
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,791
So, assuming we wanna set up
our base camp right here,

300
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,083
we had better discuss
taking possession of it.

301
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,416
[IKE]
We should, shouldn't we?

302
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,791
If we do, we get unlimited
access to the river,

303
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:28,666
and we'll also get points
every eight hours!

304
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,875
Although, it isn't quite
as simple as that.

305
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,083
The leader's gotta renew
possession to get those points.

306
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,333
That's right. If another
class sees them do it...

307
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,541
Can't we just, like,

308
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,583
surround them while
they renew it?

309
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,375
Good idea! What do
you guys think?

310
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,625
[MATSUSHITA]
Yeah, that sounds like a plan!

311
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,833
[HASE] We have enough
people to block them.

312
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,208
[STUDENT 9A]
Yeah, form a ring around them!

313
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,375
Last question then.

314
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,458
Who'll be our fearless leader?

315
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,625
[MITA]
Let's see.

316
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,583
I think Hirata should
be our leader!

317
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,125
[STUDENT 9A]
Hirata's the natural choice.

318
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,916
Hey, guys. I have
something to say!

319
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,541
I've really been thinking
about this a lot.

320
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,750
People like Hirata and
Karuizawa stand out,

321
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,166
even if they don't intend to.

322
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,833
And the person we
elect as our leader

323
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,833
should be someone who
flies under the radar,

324
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,791
but they need to be
responsible, too, right?

325
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,541
Only one of our classmates
fits both requirements.

326
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,916
And, that person's Horikita.

327
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,500
[KIKYO]
What do you think?

328
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,250
I'm in favor!

329
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,041
Horikita, if you'll accept the
role, I'd like you to have it.

330
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,541
What do ya say?

331
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,666
If she won't,

332
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,000
I'd be happy to be
the class leader.

333
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,000
[SUZUNE] Ugh, fine, then.
I accept the position.

334
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,458
[AYANOKOJI]
Ouch.

335
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,583
Okay!

336
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,750
That addresses the issue
of bathing and drinking water

337
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,291
for the whole week. Huh?

338
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,458
Yeah. I guess.

339
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,958
It looks drinkable, anyway.

340
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,166
[KARUIZAWA] Are you sure
this is safe to drink?

341
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,708
I mean, it is a river.

342
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,041
[SHINO]
What if there's bacteria?

343
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,125
[HASE]
Can you tell?

344
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,708
[IKE]
What's the matter with you guys?

345
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,083
We found a freakin' river!

346
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,250
There's no way we're
not going to use it!

347
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,250
[HIRATA]
We do have some time.

348
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,416
There's no need to make
a hasty decision about it.

349
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,958
[KARUIZAWA]
Uh, yeah!

350
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,041
[SHINO]
He's right.

351
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,833
[HASE]
Kinda risky, don't you think?

352
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,125
Ike.

353
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,000
You have experience
in the great outdoors?

354
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,333
Yeah, I do. My family
loves camping

355
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,375
and we used to go every
weekend when I was little.

356
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,041
I have no problem with
drinking river water.

357
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,958
[IKE] Sometimes you can tell
if a spring is drinkable

358
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,708
just by looking at it.

359
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,583
Ayanokoji. Could I
talk to you for a sec?

360
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,916
Before it gets dark,

361
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,666
I'd like you to gather
some branches for us

362
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,958
to use as firewood tonight.

363
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,333
Yeah, okay. I'll get
on that right now.

364
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,708
Wait! It's too dangerous
for you to go on your own!

365
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,083
[AYANOKOJI]
I'll find someone to help me.

366
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,375
Great!

367
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,958
[SUZUNE] Despite being
the big man in Class D.

368
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,333
He still has to rely
on you to help him.

369
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,916
Pathetic, isn't it?

370
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,416
[AYANOKOJI] It wouldn't
kill you to help out a little,

371
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,291
too, fearless leader.

372
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,666
We both know there's nothing
that I can help with.

373
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,916
I'm useless right now.

374
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,833
But if an enemy or other
objective turns up,

375
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,583
I'll be happy to
offer my thoughts.

376
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,375
[AYANOKOJI]
Hey. I'm gathering branches.

377
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,833
You could help.

378
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,375
[YAMAUCHI]
Hm?

379
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,833
[YAMAUCHI]
Listen, Ayanokoji.

380
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,583
I think I'm gonna
go after Sakura.

381
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,166
Let's face it: Kushida is
way out of my league.

382
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,041
Yes, and?

383
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,625
But a girl like Sakura--

384
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,625
if I can convince her that
I'm a sensitive, caring guy,

385
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,333
I just know she'll fall for me.

386
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:05,125
[AYANOKOJI] Is that why you
decided to tag along and help?

387
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,791
Hey, Sakura, are you tired?

388
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,500
Do you need help carrying those?

389
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,500
Must be such hard
work for a girl,

390
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,125
and you might hurt
your sweet little self.

391
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,583
Uh. It's fine I'm okay.

392
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,583
Hey, what's the matter?

393
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,750
Wha--? What the heck
is your problem?

394
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,625
Oh. Nevermind, it's fine.

395
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,750
[YAMAUCHI]
Hey, everything all right?

396
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:44,000
Just leave me alone.
I don't need help.

397
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,375
You must be in a lot
of pain, though.

398
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,750
You're Ibuki from
Class C, right?

399
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:52,250
Did your classmates
do something to you?

400
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,958
[YAMAUCHI] The three of us
are students from Class D.

401
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,166
You can come back to our base
camp with us, if you want.

402
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,375
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

403
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,791
Didn't you hear me?

404
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't need your help.

405
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,583
And I'm in Class C,
which means I'm your enemy.

406
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,875
We can't leave you
out here all alone!

407
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:09,708
Right?

408
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,583
[SAKURA]
Mm-hm.

409
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,083
We'll stay right here with you.

410
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,458
When you can walk,
we'll let you go.

411
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,291
[IBUKI]
How stupid can you be?

412
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,375
You shouldn't trust me.

413
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,875
No one in my class would
dream of doing this.

414
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,125
[IKE] You can't start a fire
with branches alone, see?

415
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:30,583
But if you build it like this,
I think it'll light up nicely.

416
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,625
And there we go!

417
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,166
Experienced camper, huh?

418
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,250
You sure know your stuff!

419
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,125
That's the most
basic of the basics!

420
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,625
Anybody can do it
once they know!

421
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,958
That's pretty cool!

422
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,458
[KIKYO]
Hey, we're back!

423
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,375
[KIKYO] Do you think...
that this one's edible?

424
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't know about that.

425
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,166
They could be blueberries!

426
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,125
Hey, those are bog bilberries!

427
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,875
Are you the one who found
those, Kikyo? Awesome!

428
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,375
[KIKYO]
So, Kanji.

429
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,625
Do you know what those
brown things are?

430
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,666
I'm pretty sure
that those are figs!

431
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,625
They're deliciously sweet,
like nothing else.

432
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,208
Man, this brings me back!

433
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,125
[KARUIZAWA]
Oh, really?

434
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,291
Ike, you know all
about this stuff.

435
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,416
It's so reassuring.

436
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,708
[AYANOKOJI]
Check out the fire.

437
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,166
Ike started that, too.

438
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,708
[KIKYO]
Kanji, you really are amazing!

439
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,083
[SATO]
I agree!

440
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,833
[HIDEO] He did such a great
job starting the fire...

441
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:24,958
[YAMAUCHI]
He found the river, too!

442
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,416
[INO] I'm grateful
that we have someone

443
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,750
so experienced in our class!

444
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,041
Hey, Karuizawa.
Sorry about before.

445
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,708
Wha--? Where did that come from?

446
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,541
I just remembered something.

447
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,500
The first time my
family went camping,

448
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,083
the bathroom stuff was hard.

449
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,791
I complained to my
parents the whole time.

450
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,375
It must be even harder
for girls, right?

451
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,000
[AYANOKOJI]
Ike can admit he was wrong

452
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,750
without getting worked up?

453
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,916
That's impressive.
He's a better man than me.

454
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,791
[KARUIZAWA]
I'm sorry, too, Ike.

455
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,500
We've gotta push our
limits now and then

456
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,916
if we wanna have any points
left at the end of all this.

457
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,833
[HIRATA] Hey, you guys.
Can I say something?

458
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,375
I think it's important for us
to trust and rely on each other

459
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,000
as much as possible until
the end of this special test.

460
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,208
So, here's my idea.

461
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,750
Of the 300 S-points,

462
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,708
let's aim to have 120
of 'em left by the end.

463
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,208
What do you guys say?
Is that doable?

464
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,916
You mean you want
to spend 180 points?

465
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,333
[HIRATA] If we didn't have Ike,
and had to buy it all,

466
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,375
food and water.
That's every meal for

467
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,625
every single one of us
for seven days.

468
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,416
The most efficient way
would be the rations

469
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,875
and mineral water set.

470
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,125
It's ten S-points each for
one meal for all of us.

471
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,541
What do you think?

472
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,333
He's pretty spot-on.

473
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,791
I've been turning
those exact numbers

474
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,541
over in my mind all day.

475
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,666
Did you share that
bit with Hirata?

476
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,583
[SUZUNE] Of course not.
You're joking, right?

477
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,166
See?

478
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,833
A hundred and twenty S-points
is more than you might think.

479
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,166
After all, remember the
test results from earlier?

480
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,750
Think of those numbers.

481
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,166
Class A's total points changed
by how much again? Uh, I forgot.

482
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,666
It was 94 points.

483
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,791
And that's if we
do the very least.

484
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,041
For every day that we can find
food and water on our own...

485
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,166
...we'll be able to save
20 S-points on those days!

486
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,666
[HIRATA] If we can make it
the whole week without

487
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,166
buying drinking water,
we can save

488
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,750
50 points that way alone.

489
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, that's good.

490
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,166
[IKE]
Let's give it a shot, Hirata!

491
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,708
[HIRATA]
All right, then, sounds good.

492
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,500
Let's all do our best!

493
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,000
[AYANOKOJI]
Sorry about this.

494
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,750
Just a little bit longer.

495
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,791
See. Those guys by the fire.

496
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,375
They're discussing what
to do with you now.

497
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,541
[IBUKI] You shouldn't
go out of your way.

498
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,250
It's just a matter of time
before they cast me out.

499
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,833
I wouldn't be so sure.

500
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,666
We have a few trusting types.

501
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,666
[KIKYO]
Your name's Ibuki, right?

502
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,458
Here. You should eat.

503
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,291
[IBUKI] You're all idiots.
Every single one of you.

504
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,791
Oh, just eat. What harm
is there in that?

505
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,416
We can have a talk later, too,
if you're feeling up to it.

506
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,166
[KEN]
Damn that stupid punk! Koenji!

507
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,166
[STUDENT 9B]
How could he do this?

508
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,708
[STUDENT 9]
He's a selfish jerk!

509
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,125
[STUDENT 9D] How will that
affect our points...

510
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,666
[KIKYO]
What happened?

511
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,833
Koenji said he was feeling sick
and went back to the boat!

00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,291
According to the
rules of the test,

514
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:10,000
his illness alone will

00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,333
Koenji will be out of the game,

516
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,791
and he's required to stay
on the ship and recover.

00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:14,958
He can't come back.

00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:18,416
[bell ringing]

2
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,208
[SAKURA gasps]

3
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,875
Wait, come back!

4
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,708
[AYANOKOJI] American
Anthropologist Edward Hall

5
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:35,375
divided the concept of personal
space into four general zones.

6
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,583
He named one of these
the "intimate space" zone.

7
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,416
With the "close phase"
contained therein.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,625
The latter is near enough
for someone to hug them.

9
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:48,500
Many resist letting
others into this zone.

10
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,500
However, some people
seem to enter

11
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,833
into everyone's
close phase easily.

12
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,625
Kushida's one of those.

13
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,666
Even if she enters
someone's close phase,

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,208
she manages not to trigger
an aversive reaction.

15
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,458
[SAKURA panting]

16
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:04,250
[AYANOKOJI] Even so,
Sakura resisted Kushida.

17
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:12,458
[AYANOKOJI] For some unknown
reason, she ran away from her.

18
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,333
She couldn't even
look her in the eye.

19
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,916
[AYANOKOJI] Why does she fear
contact with others?

20
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,416
Um. I'm so sorry!

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,041
You two are very kind to agree
to come with me for this.

22
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,375
No, this whole thing
is my fault!

23
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,041
I'm the one who
owes you an apology

24
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,458
for breaking your camera!

25
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,833
[SAKURA] Thanks, but I should
have been more careful.

26
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,000
[AYANOKOJI] So, you're going
to the electronics store

27
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,458
where you got your
camera to get it fixed.

28
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,916
I understand that part.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,333
But why did I have to come?

30
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,208
[KIKYO giggles]

31
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,291
I need you, too.

32
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,791
[SERVICE MAN 5A]
Man, what a bummer.

33
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,625
This is no good.
I see what's wrong here.

34
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,875
Looks like a power
issue if you ask me.

35
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,833
Mm. Definitely.

36
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,583
[SERVICE MAN 5A]
Do you have a warranty with you?

37
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,916
Should be covered.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,291
You did remember to
bring it with you, right?

39
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,791
[SAKURA]
Mm-hm.

40
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:38,541
[gasps] It hasn't expired, yay!

41
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,541
You could have the broken
part, uh--replaced.

42
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,708
Completely free of charge.

43
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,041
[gasps]

44
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,125
[AYANOKOJI] I see.
Sakura's scared of strangers.

45
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,333
Of course, this guy
would freak her out.

46
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:53,208
I'm here because she wanted
strength in numbers.

47
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,750
Um. Do you know how
long the repairs will take?

48
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,666
[SERVICE MAN 5A]
Two or three days max, I think.

49
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,250
But don't quote me.

50
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,416
I need you to fill out this
form, but not the whole thing.

51
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,041
Fill out your name here,
home address,

52
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,458
and your cell phone number.

53
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,791
[gasps]

54
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,083
Are you all right?

55
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,625
[gasps] Uh, yeah.

56
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,958
[SAKURA whimpering]

57
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,583
[AYANOKOJI]
Let me do it.

58
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,291
When the repairs are complete,

59
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,333
please contact me
instead of Sakura.

60
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,000
[SERVICE MAN 5A]
What?! Hey, wait a minute!

61
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,083
The camera belongs
to her, doesn't it?

62
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,083
I don't think we can do that.

63
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,041
I'm not comfortable with this.

64
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,541
You saw the warranty.

65
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,375
It notes the time and
location of purchase

66
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,458
so you shouldn't need
her information.

67
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,625
I understand that
it's store policy,

68
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,541
but you won't get in trouble.

69
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,875
I can't imagine there
being a legal issue.

70
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:55,958
You don't have to worry.

71
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,916
Well. Are you sure about that?

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,458
[gasping]

73
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,041
[gasps]

74
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,791
[SERVICE MAN 5A] I guess
we can do that this time.

75
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,916
[SAKURA]
By the way,

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,875
thank you very much
for coming to my aid.

77
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,041
[KIKYO] No problem. It was the
least I could do to atone!

78
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,375
But, listen, Sakura.
We're the same age.

79
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,500
You don't have to speak
to us so formally.

80
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,208
I'd like to think we're friends!

81
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,375
Yes, you've been acting
like we're your elders.

82
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,083
[gasps] Um. Yeah.

83
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,875
Makes sense.

84
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,041
I will try.

85
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,583
I mean, I'll do my best.

86
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,625
No need to force
anything, either!

87
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,208
[SAKURA]
Um. Right, I won't.

88
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,208
[KIKYO]
Mm-hm!

89
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,875
I'll be back in a bit.

90
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,625
I'm gonna go freshen up.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,875
[AYANOKOJI]
Being alone with her is awkward.

92
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,750
[gasps]

93
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:51,833
[AYANOKOJI]
Hm?

94
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,458
Is something on your mind?

95
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,750
Do you not feel
comfortable with the--?

96
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,041
Listen. What do you
think I should do?

97
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:04,666
I can't figure out what
would be best for everyone.

98
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,041
Oh, you mean about Sudo?

99
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,416
The best thing would be
to do what you want.

100
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,416
[gasps] "Do what I want"?

101
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,916
That's right.

102
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,916
[SAKURA]
If I keep quiet,

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,166
I know I'm going to regret it.

104
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,666
[AYANOKOJI] Why are you talking
to me about this?

105
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,041
Your eyes. There's
nothing scary in them.

106
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,625
Eyes?

107
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,791
Never mind.

108
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,958
It's... hard to...

109
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,500
If you need some advice,

110
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,125
I think Kushida's more versed
in this kind of stuff.

111
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,375
She showed up for you today.

112
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,791
[AYANOKOJI]
That's interesting.

113
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,833
[AYANOKOJI]
I can tell that she's grateful,

114
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,541
but she doesn't seem
to fully trust Kushida.

115
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,375
Maybe she's more
perceptive than most.

116
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:55,166
You said you'd regret it if you
kept silent about the fight.

117
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,875
Yeah.

118
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,833
Well, I think you already
know what to do.

119
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,166
[gasps]

120
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,916
[AYANOKOJI]
Don't do it for Sudo,

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,750
or Kushida, or for any
of our classmates.

122
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,875
Push all of those thoughts
out of your mind.

123
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,125
They don't serve you.

124
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,041
[SAKURA] Serve me?
What do you mean by that?

125
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,083
[AYANOKOJI] Thinking that way
will only convolute things

126
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,083
and make the choice
more difficult.

127
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:19,083
You should trust your instincts,
and testify for your sake alone.

128
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,666
You mean do the right
thing... for me?

129
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,583
That's motivation enough.

130
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,958
[gasps]

131
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,458
[KIKYO] Sorry for taking
so long in there!

132
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,916
Oh. Welcome back.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,250
All right. Do you guys think

134
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,875
that we should call
it a day now?

135
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,333
It is getting pretty late.

136
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,958
You're right. Hey,
would you mind terribly

137
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,500
if I swung by your room
a little later tonight?

138
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,833
Huh?

139
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,791
[KIKYO]
Thanks for having me!

140
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,000
You just had to come to my room?

141
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:52,833
What's this about?

142
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,083
I found some stuff online

143
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,000
that I thought you might
be interested to see.

144
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,541
Does this girl look
familiar to you?

145
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,666
[AYANOKOJI]
Hold on. Is that Sakura?

146
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,125
It's hard to say if it's her.

147
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,291
I can't tell just from
the pictures alone.

148
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,875
But this one was definitely
taken in one of the dorms here.

149
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,666
[KIKYO]
Do you think it's her, then?

150
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,250
Well, it could be.

151
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,375
I thought it was strange that
she was wearing fake glasses,

152
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,125
but now it makes perfect sense.

153
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,541
[KIKYO]
They're fake?

154
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,708
[AYANOKOJI] There was no
distortion behind the lenses.

155
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,375
So you think she's wearing
them to disguise her face?

156
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,500
Could that be why she
didn't want to testify?

157
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,750
[phone chimes]

158
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,458
[KIKYO]
It's a message from Sakura.

159
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,291
Let's see here...

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,375
You're not gonna believe this.

161
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,708
She might be willing
to help us defend Sudo!

162
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,791
[AYANOKOJI] I guess going
with her today was worth it.

163
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:48,291
I'm glad she decided she could
trust us, but I wonder why.

164
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,208
[KIKYO]
Hey.

165
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,291
Ayanokoji, are you sure
you're not trying

166
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,750
to hide anything
from me? For real.

167
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,750
[AKANEAKENE]
I've sent out the notification.

168
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,666
All in classes C
and D were invited.

169
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,083
The arbitration hearing is
set to take place tomorrow.

170
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,041
Is that so?

171
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,708
[MANABU]
Class D.

172
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,833
Uh?

173
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,166
What's wrong?

174
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,833
Did you spend your entire
day off with Kushida?

175
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,250
Yeah, because of
the thing with Sakura.

176
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,583
Though we couldn't get her
to commit to testifying.

177
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,375
Not definitively.

178
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,541
I see.

179
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,875
[AYANOKOJI]
What's the matter with you?

180
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,791
What do you mean,
"What's the matter?"

181
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,375
[AYANOKOJI]
Well... You are epitomizing

182
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,875
"that-face" at the moment.

183
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,833
Really? And what do
you mean by "that face"?

184
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,333
This is just my face.

185
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,875
Although...

186
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,458
I am amazed at how self-serving
you've been acting recently.

187
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,416
You hesitate when I
ask for a favor,

188
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,375
but when Kushida does,
you gladly jump for her.

189
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,583
I'm analyzing, rationally,
and precisely,

190
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,000
what factors
account for the disparity.

191
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,333
Doesn't matter.

192
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,750
Could've fooled me.

193
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,083
More importantly.
The student council has

194
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,125
decided on the time of
Sudo's arbitration hearing.

195
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,833
[AYANOKOJI]
When is it?

196
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,958
It's today, after school.

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,125
[AKANE] We will now begin
the deliberation proceedings

198
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,208
regarding the violent incident
that occurred last Tuesday.

199
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,750
Your presence is appreciated.

200
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,083
Now, first of all,

201
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,250
I will preside today, as
Student Council Secretary.

202
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,791
The student council president,

203
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,708
attending arbitration over a
little brawl such as this one?

204
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,708
I never dreamed I
would see this day.

205
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,166
[MANABU] My extremely busy
schedule often prevents me from

206
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,625
being present at proceedings
I would prefer to join.

207
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,500
As a rule, though,
I try to attend.

208
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,833
Oh, of course. A coincidence.

209
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,291
[MANABU]
Indeed...

210
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,125
[AYANOKOJI]
Horikita wasn't expecting

211
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,791
her brother to be here.

212
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:54,958
It seems like his presence
might throw off her game.

213
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,625
Let's begin. The object here
is to ascertain the truth.

214
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,416
Which version of
the events is factual.

215
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,833
Is that acceptable, sir?

216
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,416
[MANABU]
Yes, you may proceed.

217
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,666
[AKANE] Komiya et al, you allege
that Sudo summoned you to

218
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,458
the special annex last Tuesday,
where he then attacked you.

219
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,041
Sudo denies your claim.

220
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,291
He insists that Komiya
summoned him to the annex.

221
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,958
Your versions of these
events are contradictory.

222
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,333
We can be certain
of only one thing.

223
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,416
Sudo attacked
and injured you three.

224
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,875
Komiya, Kondo, and Ishizaki
are the victims here,

225
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,625
and we will proceed
under the agreement

226
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,500
that they are the plaintiffs.

227
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,125
Sudo's the defendant
in this case.

228
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,291
[KEN growls]
I'll admit that I beat them up!

229
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,625
But these jerks are
the real attackers!

230
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,416
[AYANOKOJI] Putting the
focus on their injuries

231
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,916
and giving Sudo free reign here

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,541
will do nothing but
harm our case.

233
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,208
Horikita.

234
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,500
[KEN]
...you're jealous that I got

235
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,833
bumped up to first string!

236
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,875
You always try to sabotage
me at practice, but it--

237
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,041
[AKANE] Silence, please.
Return to your seat.

238
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,125
Without any new evidence
or testimony,

239
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,416
we will proceed under the
aforementioned assumptions.

240
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,375
Is this acceptable?

241
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,208
[MANABU]
It's quite apparent

242
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,291
there was no need
for adjudication.

243
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,125
Judging by the severity of
the plaintiffs' conditions,

244
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,833
it's clear that the violence
was one-sided.

245
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,750
I believe this is
sufficient evidence

246
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,708
to allow me to make my decision.

247
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,333
Class D's self-defense
claim lacks credibility

248
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,833
due to Sudo's absence of
injuries. And the plaintiffs'...

249
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,833
[gasps]

250
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:31,208
[gasping] Hey! Stop it!

251
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,541
[KEN]
Uh...

252
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,125
[gasping continues]

253
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,208
[SUZUNE sputtering]
Cut it out.

254
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,000
[AYANOKOJI]
When someone's spacing out,

255
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,208
a strong physical stimulus can
often snap them out of it.

256
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,333
The stakes are too high
for me to do nothing.

257
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,208
[SUZUNE]
...come on!  Uh!

258
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:56,208
If you don't start fighting now,
we're going to lose this case.

259
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,416
[gasps]

260
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,708
[SUZUNE]
I beg your pardon.

261
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:06,125
Before we break, I would like
to question the witnesses.

262
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,083
Would that be acceptable?

263
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,375
President?

264
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,500
I will allow it.

265
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,625
[inhales, exhales]

266
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,166
The first question.

267
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,375
What were the circumstances
under which Sudo summoned you?

268
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,625
I need an answer.

269
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,333
Uh, when practice was over,

270
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,208
he just said he wanted
to talk to me.

271
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,708
[SUZUNE]
I see.

272
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,916
And what was your reasoning for
bringing Ishizaki with you

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,333
to the special annex?

274
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,750
He's not on the basketball
team, as far as I know.

275
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,791
There was no reason
for him to be present.

276
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,500
I brought him 'cause I
wanted extra protection.

277
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,000
Protection?

278
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,041
Everyone in school knows what
a violent guy Sudo can be.

279
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,666
And he's pretty big, too!

280
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,875
[SUZUNE]
So you're saying you thought

281
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,625
he might attack you, right?

282
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,916
[KOMIYA]
That's right!

283
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,416
[AYANOKOJI] That sounds
like a studied response.

284
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,250
If I understand, you claim
you brought Ishizaki

285
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,708
as a bodyguard, because of
his reputation as a fighter?

286
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,041
Yeah, I did it to
protect myself!

287
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,541
Understood.

288
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,000
I have some knowledge of martial
arts, as a matter of fact.

289
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,000
Sudo faced multiple adversaries

290
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,916
which is exponentially
more difficult to do.

291
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,750
For him to beat you so soundly,

292
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,583
especially with
Ishizaki at your back

293
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,500
defending you,
doesn't quite add up.

294
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,458
Uh! It does!

295
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,083
He only beat us because we
didn't want to get into a fight!

296
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,375
[SUZUNE]
If you didn't want a fight,

297
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,541
why would you go, knowing
Sudo's propensities?

298
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,125
And if you weren't
fighting back,

299
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,583
how would all three of you end
up with such severe injuries?

300
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,208
Common sense tells me
Horikita has a good point.

301
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,375
[KOMIYA] You can't use common
sense with Sudo!

302
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,208
He doesn't operate that way!

303
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,291
He's a violent,
unpredictable psychopath!

304
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,541
Well, you're in luck,

305
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,458
because someone witnessed
the entire fight.

306
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,291
[SAKAGAMI gasps]

307
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,458
[KEN gasps]

308
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,333
Would the witness
please step forward?

309
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,916
[AKANE]
Welcome, Miss.

310
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,458
Would you state your name,
for the record?

311
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,625
Yes. Airi Sakura.

312
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,541
I'm from Class One-D.

313
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,250
[AKANE]
Please take a seat, Miss Sakura.

314
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,708
[SAKURA]
Okay...

315
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,875
Sakura.

316
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,875
[gasps]

317
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,875
I did see it. I witnessed
the whole thing.

318
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,208
Sudo has been telling
the truth this whole time.

319
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,125
The Class C students attacked
him first, like he said.

320
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,666
I'm sure of it. They're lying.

321
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,000
Your name's Sakura, is it not?

322
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,166
If you did see the fight, then
why didn't you come forward

323
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,750
with your knowledge
before this point?

324
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,291
Well, you see... Because...

325
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:37,041
[sighs] Honestly, Class D
students are all the same.

326
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,166
I promise this is the truth.

327
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,875
I'm not lying, I swear.

328
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,416
Oh, Sakura. Miss Airi Sakura.

329
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,833
Let's be honest now.

330
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,875
Are you sure they
haven't coerced you?

331
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,041
The stakes are high, and they'd
do anything to save Sudo.

332
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,125
[gasps]

333
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,625
[AYANOKOJI]
This could go badly.

334
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,208
Spin it how you wish.

335
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,375
The fact that she's here proves
that she witnessed the fight.

336
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,083
I mean, think about it.

337
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,208
If she hadn't, why would
she show up today,

338
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,333
even if we tried to coerce her?

339
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,666
Oh?

340
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,833
If all we needed was
someone who'd lie,

341
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,833
why would we choose a girl like
Sakura, who hates to speak up?

342
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,500
Perhaps to lend an air of
credibility to your case,

343
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,083
you specifically chose
someone who is well-behaved.

344
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,625
That's all you've got?

345
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,666
You're the ones with
the burden of proof,

346
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,041
and from where I
sit, the facts--

347
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,458
It's immoral of you to
take advantage of this girl.

348
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,916
She's weak-willed,
so you manipulate her.

349
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,750
That is not what's going on!

350
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,166
Just look at how hard
she's trembling over there!

351
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,583
You put such a burden on her.

352
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,041
I have real proof!

353
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,333
I saw the fight. I'll prove it.

354
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,666
You are only digging
yourselves a deeper hole.

355
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,125
[SAKURA]
Here it is.

356
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,541
The proof that I was there.
In the annex last Tuesday.

357
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,375
See for yourself.

358
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,500
[gasps]

359
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,500
Let's see it.

360
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,833
Yes.

361
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,125
[SAKURA]
I was there that afternoon,

362
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,000
looking for a place
to take pictures.

363
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,541
I don't like to take
them around people,

364
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,208
and I knew the annex
would be empty.

365
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,125
The photo is dated, too.

366
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,041
Dates on digital photos are
relatively simple to alter,

367
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,916
Miss Sakura. Your proof
is rather insubstantial.

368
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,041
Just a minute, Mr. Sakagami.

369
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,666
This photo is sufficient
proof after all.

370
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,625
[SAKAGAMI]
Hm? Ah.

371
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,000
Thank you, sir.

372
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,000
I hope this one will
be proof enough.

373
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,166
I told you that I was
telling the truth.

374
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,625
Thank you so much, Sakura.

375
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,875
[gasps]

376
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,041
[SAKAGAMI]
I'll grant you that much.

377
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,000
It seems that you
were indeed present

378
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,416
in the special annex on
the day in question.

379
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,458
But your photo still
does nothing to prove

380
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,291
that Sudo didn't
start the fight.

381
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,791
It also doesn't provide evidence

382
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,041
that you really witnessed
everything that happened.

383
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,791
[SAKURA]
But I did.

384
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,958
So then, I propose a compromise.

385
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,083
A compromise? What kind?

386
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,875
[SAKAGAMI] Despite the
"evidence" you provided,

387
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,750
you still don't have
any definitive proof.

388
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,333
However, it appears that
Class C may indeed

389
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,666
bear some responsibility
in this debacle.

390
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,583
[SAKAGAMI] I recommend a
two-week suspension for Sudo.

391
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,458
And a one-week suspension
for the Class-C students.

392
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,083
Is that acceptable?

393
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,083
The difference in length
is commensurate

394
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,500
to the severity in harm
done to each party.

395
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,541
[growls]

396
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,333
[AYANOKOJI] If Sakura hadn't
come forward with her testimony,

397
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,583
Sudo would have been suspended
for a month, at the very least.

398
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,583
It is a good bargain, actually.

399
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:34,375
Ms. Chabashira, does that idea
sound satisfactory to you?

400
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:39,208
It would appear we have reached
an agreement that will suffice.

401
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,583
[AYANOKOJI] Sakura, you did
everything you could.

402
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,750
Then, that's it.

403
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,625
Miss Horikita,
as representative of Class D,

404
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:55,250
what's your opinion
of the agreement?

405
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,250
[SUZUNE]
This is my final word.

406
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,000
Sudo has a problem.

407
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,291
I think he contributed
to this, ultimately.

408
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,125
Even if he's not the one
who threw the first punch.

409
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,375
He has no sense of how
he affects others.

410
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,541
Actions have consequences,
but he doesn't see that.

411
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,333
Incidents like this
will not stop.

412
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,666
[gasps] What?!

413
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,458
You need to see the
truth of the matter.

414
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,916
Your poor attitude is what
started all of this, really.

415
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,041
He does need to reflect
on his actions.

416
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,458
But not the missteps you claim
he took in fight last Tuesday.

417
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,083
I mean that he should reevaluate
the person he has been

418
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,791
this whole school year.

419
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,250
Horikita?

420
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,458
In regards to the incident
we're discussing right now,

421
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,958
that's different.

422
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,125
I truly believe Sudo is free
of all guilt in the matter.

423
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,583
The truth is, I know that Sudo

424
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,875
didn't stumble into that
fight of his own accord.

425
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,958
This was a premeditated set-up,
instigated by Class C,

426
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,541
and that is truly heinous.

427
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,375
I will not back down.

428
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,916
I assert that he is innocent.

429
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,583
[laughs] Premeditated set-up?

430
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,708
That's hilarious, young lady.

431
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,041
I think the president's
sister is a--

432
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,916
As the witness
testified earlier,

433
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,125
Sudo's not guilty in this.

434
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,041
I implore you to make
the appropriate decision.

435
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,333
We've been victimized
by him! He's guilty!

436
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,291
You shut your mouth! Jerk!

437
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,458
I'm innocent,
and all of you know it!

438
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,000
You're just trying
to sabotage me

439
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,291
and usurp my place
on the team...!

440
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,958
[MANABU]
Just as I predicted.

441
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,291
This hearing was a waste
of everyone's time.

442
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,250
I'm appalled at the pathetic
behavior on display right now.

443
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,333
Nothing can be settled unless
the liars come forward.

444
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,333
[AKANE]
I agree. This is pointless.

445
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,375
[MANABU]
Therefore, I ask you, Class C.

446
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,541
Can you honestly say right
now that the statements

447
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,208
you've made today are
the unadulterated truth?

448
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,250
What? Of course they're true!

449
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,208
[MANABU]
What about Class D?

450
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,041
Certainly.

451
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,500
[MANABU]
Very well, then.

452
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,875
I will announce my decision
tomorrow at four o'clock.

453
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,875
If I receive no
amended statements,

454
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,291
as in admission of guilt,

455
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,875
nor proof of your opponents'
guilt by then,

456
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,875
I will be putting expulsion
on the table as well.

457
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,458
That is all.

458
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,375
[AYANOKOJI]
Do we have a chance?

459
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:08,625
Well, I don't intend to lose,
and I never give up, either.

460
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,625
I'm sorry.

461
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,125
I should have just spoken up

462
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,875
from the very beginning
about what I saw.

463
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:18,750
I'm not... I'm not brave.

464
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,041
You did just fine. It's okay.

465
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,916
But it's not!

466
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,708
[MANABU]
Why are you two still here?

467
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,541
When you showed up
with Suzune today,

468
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,250
I assumed you had a strategy.

469
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,291
But, I suppose I grossly
overestimated the both of you.

470
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,791
I never claimed to be
some star detective,

471
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,041
and I'm not a trial
lawyer, either.

472
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,208
So, no, I don't have a strategy.

473
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,375
You mean Suzune went
out on a limb today?

474
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,416
She truly believes
he's innocent?

475
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,000
[AYANOKOJI]
I guess it's a radical idea.

476
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,583
[MANABU]
Interesting.

477
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,916
Your name's Sakura, right?

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,833
[gasps] Yes.

479
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,250
If you can't provide evidence
to corroborate your claims,

480
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,500
they're nothing but lies,

481
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,708
and your mask will
become your prison.

482
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,000
But... It's not a lie.

483
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:12,125
I swear.
I was telling the truth.

484
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,083
[AYANOKOJI]
I believe every word.

485
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,166
[SAKURA gasps]

486
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,916
[MANABU]
I see. Well, in that case...

487
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,208
[AKANE gasping]

488
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,833
[SAKURA gasping]

489
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,916
Do you have what it takes
to prove her right?

490
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,166
I guess you'll
find out tomorrow.

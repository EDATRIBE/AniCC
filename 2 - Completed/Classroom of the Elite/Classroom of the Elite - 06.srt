[bell ringing]

2
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,875
[SAKURA] I've always had trouble
interacting with people.

3
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,458
I can't even bring myself
to look them in the eye.

4
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,583
It scares me.

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,583
That's why I hide.

6
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,500
I use my mask to cover
up my real self.

7
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:40,583
That way, it's harder
for people to hurt me.

8
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,958
I'm okay being by myself.

9
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,583
It's safer that way.

10
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,500
I'm okay being lonely.

11
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,791
I can get over that feeling.

13
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,041

[SAKURA sobs]

16
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,958
[AYANOKOJI]
It's hot in here.

17
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,375
[SUZUNE]
You're right,

18
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,250
and intense heat usually causes
people to be irrational.

19
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,291
Which makes it the
perfect place for a set-up.

20
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,875
Sudo'd be less likely
to keep a cool head.

21
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,333
So, then. Have ya come up
with a stellar plan yet?

22
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,625
I'm in the brainstorming phase.

23
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,833
Sakura's testimony
bought us time.

24
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,041
But we won't always
be so fortunate.

25
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,500
I just wish we could find some
more substantial evidence

26
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,166
to seal the deal.

27
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,500
Oh, speakin' of which,
this area doesn't have any.

28
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,125
[AYANOKOJI]
Security cameras.

29
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,583
[SUZUNE]
That's true.

30
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,250
If there'd been cameras, well,

31
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,208
then we would have all the
evidence we need, wouldn't we?

32
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,541
Indeed.

33
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,833
On the other hand, if this
area did have them up,

34
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,625
those jerks would never
have summoned Sudo here

35
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,083
in the first place.

36
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,916
[gasps]

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,666
What's the matter?

38
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,125
[SUZUNE] I think I've
come up with a plan.

39
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,041
[AYANOKOJI]
Sakura?

40
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,833
[gasps]

41
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,083
Oh, hey.

42
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,541
Good morning.

43
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,500
Oh. Um...

44
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,666
Yes, good morning.

45
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:39,750
[sighs]

46
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,541
What's wrong?

47
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,291
You don't have to
testify again, you know.

48
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,833
The hearing's private today.

49
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,208
So, there's no need
for you to be so tense.

50
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,916
[sighs] Okay.

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,791
And anyway, we have a plan.

52
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,250
If it works, we'll be able
to save the whole class.

53
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,250
You're the one who
made that possible.

54
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,333
[gasps]

55
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,416
I want to tell you
that I trust you.

56
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,541
[gasps]

57
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,375
[AYANOKOJI] So if you ever
happen to find yourself

58
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,416
in need of help,

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,208
just ask for me,
and I'll be there.

60
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,041
I appreciate that.

61
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,916
And I'm not the only one.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,125
I'm sure that everyone
in class trusts you, too.

63
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,625
Horikita, Kushida,
Sudo, all of them.

64
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,166
Yeah.

65
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,250
Um. Listen.

66
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,708
I've got something on my mind.

67
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,125
There's really not
much you could do

68
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,333
to help the situation,
but I thought I'd try.

69
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,666
[phone chimes]

70
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,833
I'm sorry, Sakura.

71
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,208
I hate to cut you off,

72
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,583
but is there any way we
could talk about this later?

73
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,291
Yeah.

74
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,333
[KONDO]
So damn hot!

75
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,083
[KOMIYA]
Why the special annex?

76
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,500
What do you guys
think Kushida wants

77
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,708
to talk to us about, anyway?

78
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,333
[KOMIYA]
I bet she's gonna ask me out!

79
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, right, keep dreamin',
ya big dummy.

80
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,541
[KOMIYA]
Ah! Not so hard, jerk!

81
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,375
Let me go!

82
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,625
Huh?

83
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,541
[KONDO, KOMIYA]
Uh!

84
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,583
[ISHIZAKI]
What the hell?

85
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,166
What are you doing in here?

86
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,083
You were expecting Kushida?

87
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,416
Huh?

88
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,375
[AYANOKOJI] That email
she sent was just a ruse.

89
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,166
I told her to send it to you.

90
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,125
And why would you do that?

91
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,416
I wanted to have a chat.

92
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,625
It was the only way
to get you here.

93
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,958
But, I'm glad I finally
have your attention.

94
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,166
Listen, last time we
got summoned here

95
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,208
was when Sudo beat us up.
You know that's the truth.

96
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,000
Sudo needs to take his
punishment like a real man.

97
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,416
We're out of here.

98
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,833
[SUZUNE]
I'd stay if I were you.

99
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,083
If you leave now, you'll regret
it for the rest of your lives.

100
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,458
Do you really want to ruin
your futures like that?

101
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,750
And what the hell is
your problem, lady?!

102
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:43,791
Whatever.

103
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,791
Maybe you should be
more observant.

104
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,833
What are you even talking about?

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,416
[gasps]

106
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,833
[BOTH gasp]

107
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,916
What's the matter?

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,208
You seem a little shaken up.

109
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,958
Is that a... security camera?

110
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,583
There's a science laboratory
in the special annex.

111
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,208
They work with all kinds of
hazardous chemicals in there,

112
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,541
so, of course there
would be cameras.

113
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,083
[grunting, gasps]

114
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,333
[ISHIZAKI]
But, how?

115
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,791
Wait a minute.

116
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,500
If there's footage
from those cameras

117
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,875
of what happened in here,

118
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,708
they'd know Sudo's
innocent and wouldn't

119
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,916
need to have a hearing
in the first place.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,541
And you would definitely
have no reason

121
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,291
to tell us about it, either.

122
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,500
The moment that the
incident took place,

123
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:33,041
both parties were doomed to
suffer some form of punishment.

124
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,916
Regardless of why, the truth
is that Sudo beat you up.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That is an indisputable fact.

126
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,625
Oh, so that's why we're here.

127
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,583
You guys would also be hurt
by the camera recordings.

128
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,291
Of course, Sudo is still
going to be punished,

129
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,125
but what you three did
could get you all expelled.

130
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,250
[BOTH gasp]

131
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,708
[AYANOKOJI]
You told a malicious lie

132
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,416
and got the whole
school involved.

133
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,833
What did you expect
would happen?

134
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,416
Oh, yeah?

135
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,166
If that's true, then why hasn't
the school said anything to us?

136
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,416
The school has a habit
of testing its students.

137
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,958
They want to see
if we can work out

138
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,666
some sort of truce on our own.

139
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,125
That's why they're taking
a hands-off approach.

140
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,500
They want to see
what we'll achieve

141
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,291
with the extra time
we've been given.

142
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,750
[gasps]

143
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,291
I want you all to think back
on the hearing yesterday.

144
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,583
Don't you think it seemed like
they already knew everything?

145
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,958
[KONDO]
No way. I can't get expelled.

146
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,708
Ishizaki! Why don't we
tell them we made it up.

147
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,041
If we have a solution,

148
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,916
maybe they'll be more
lenient and not expel us!

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,333
[KONDO]
What are we even supposed to do?

150
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,041
Shut up, you idiots!

151
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,583
[AYANOKOJI] Don't be too hasty
in making your decision.

152
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,791
You know there is a way to
save both of our classes.

153
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,833
If you're open to hearing it.

154
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,250
Like hell there's a way, jerk!

155
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,500
[SUZUNE] Why not take the entire
incident off the table?

156
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,583
[MALE STUDENTS gasp]

157
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,083
It's quite simple, really.

158
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,708
If you three would only
withdraw your complaint,

159
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,583
it will be like nothing
bad ever happened.

160
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,500
[AYANOKOJI]
If no fight occurred here,

161
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,333
then how can the authorities
punish anyone?

162
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,083
All we have to do is get our
collective story straight,

163
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,750
then the school can't
pursue it any further.

164
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,916
So, do we have a deal?

165
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,750
Hold on a minute.

166
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,458
I just have to talk it
over with someone first.

167
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,750
[ISHIZAKI]
Hey!

168
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,333
What's the matter, can't make up
your mind without your master?

169
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,500
[ISHIZAKI]
Give it back!

170
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,375
How pathetic.

171
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,000
You bitch--

172
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,875
Resorting to violence?

173
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,833
Go ahead. Try it.

174
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,250
[ISHIZAKI gasping]

175
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,416
[ISHIZAKI]
Dammit!

176
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,083
Ishizaki.

00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,916
[CHABASHIRA]
To put it in the school's terms,

349
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,166
Class D is the place for those
with defective qualities.

350
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,208
The ones who barely had
the chops to get in at all.

351
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,250
It's just my opinion,
so take it with a grain of salt.

352
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,291
But out of everyone
in Class One-D,

353
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,541
the most effective student

354
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,458
is Ayanokoji.

355
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,500
Uh.

356
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,500
The students from Class C wanted
to withdraw their complaint,

357
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,708
and against my better
judgement, I allowed it.

358
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,916
Oh, did they, now?

359
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,375
It's a strange world
we live in, I guess.

360
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,125
Are you trying to prove a point?

361
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,333
That Sakura is not
in fact the fabricator

362
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,375
everyone thinks that she is?

363
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,125
Well done, sir.

364
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,833
Your little sister is
the one behind all of it.

365
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,041
I didn't do anything, really.

366
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,083
Tachibana. We have an
opening for a secretary?

367
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,541
Yes.

368
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,625
[MANABU]
Well, then.

369
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,958
You just say the word,

370
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,416
and the secretary position
on the council is yours.

371
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,583
What? Are you serious?

372
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,458
[MANABU]
Do you object?

373
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,833
No. I was just making
sure I understood.

374
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,166
I have no objections to that.

375
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,750
Ayanokoji.

376
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,125
Please join the student council.

377
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,500
No, thank you.

378
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,083
I don't like expending more
energy than I have to.

379
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,458
The student council
seems like too much work.

380
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,833
And honestly, I just want
to have a normal life.

381
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,541
I accept that for now.

382
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,541
Ayanokoji.

383
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:07,208
It would be in your best
interest not to disappoint me.

384
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,416
[gasps]

385
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,833
[RYUEN]
Which one of you was it?

386
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,208
Who withdrew the complaint
without consulting me?

387
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,916
We... We're all responsible.

388
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,166
Well, Albert.

389
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,250
[ALBERT]
Sorry, boss's orders.

390
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,000
I've got no beef with you.

391
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,375
[thuds]

392
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,583
[ISHIZAKI groaning]

393
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,291
[RYUEN] My plan was to get
one of those idiots expelled,

394
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,083
to see how the
school would react.

395
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,000
Now, I'll have to
find another way.

396
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,583
You're all worthless.

397
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,041
It's entirely reasonable that
you should suffer for your sins.

398
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,250
Give me the names of
the ones who set you up,

399
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,166
and Al will go easy.

400
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,208
[gasps]

401
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,958
Sakayanagi?

402
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,416
I recognize you.
You're from Class C, aren't you?

403
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,458
It appears you think you've
already been crowned

404
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,958
queen of the school.
Well, that's just adorable.

405
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,583
I never intended to be
queen of anything.

406
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:35,458
I'm going to crush Class D,
and then Class B.

407
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,541
And before it's said and done,

408
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,416
I'm coming for Class A, too.

409
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,875
[SAKAYANAGI] Do you really think
you can make that happen?

410
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,916
[RYUEN] There can be
only one ruler here.

411
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,791
[SAKAYANAGI]
I couldn't agree more!

412
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,958
It's a relief that your little
plan worked, isn't it?

413
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,041
[SUZUNE]
You manipulated me, didn't you?

414
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,500
Admit it.

415
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,166
[AYANOKOJI]
What do mean by that?

416
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,791
[SUZUNE] You pointed out
the lack of cameras

417
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,541
in the special annex,
which then led me to plant

418
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,958
the false evidence and
bear all of the risk.

419
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,000
[AYANOKOJI] Nah, you're
just overthinking it.

420
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,958
You made a promise to me.

421
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,791
You said that you would
help me advance to Class A.

422
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,791
Yeah, only after you
virtually forced me to.

423
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,708
[AYANOKOJI gasps]

424
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,791
Hold on.

425
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,166
I'm not quite finished
with you yet.

426
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,541
I want to know what's
going on inside your head.

427
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,916
What you're thinking.

428
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,333
Well, I just want to
live my life in peace.

429
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,875
Is that so hard to understand?

430
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,750
You wouldn't help me if you
didn't want to, deep down.

431
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,208
Yeah, you're right,

432
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,708
I suppose I just wanted to
help a friend out. Ya happy?

433
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,208
[SUZUNE]
That's a lie.

434
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,833
You've never cared about your
friends, and you know it.

435
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,291
Who are you?

436
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,666
Really. What's your game?

437
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,000
[MALE TEACHER 6A]
Line up!

438
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,250
[BOY 6A whimpering]

439
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,666
[crash]

440
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,458
[gasping]

441
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:26,416
[AYANOKOJI] I will help you get
to Class A, like I promised.

442
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,000
But...

443
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,541
But, what?

444
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,708
[AYANOKOJI]
Don't go prying into my life.

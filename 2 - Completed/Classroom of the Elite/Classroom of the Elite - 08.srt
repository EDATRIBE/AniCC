00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,458
[PERFORMER 8A]
Earth and water might impede us

00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,625
in our escape from this
wretched labyrinth prison.

00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,333
But, the sky is free!

You see, even in
the darkest depths,

00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,416
there remains a glimmer of hope.

Oh, Father.

00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,291
You've built such

But will they carry my weight?

Above everything?

My Icarus. You must
listen to me.

13
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:54,041
Freedom can addle the mind,
bring delusions and fears,

14
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,875
and arrogance can
lead one to death.

[AYANOKOJI] Now, this is an
egregious waste of tax dollars.

A few days ago, a man, whose
name I won't mention to you,

18
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,625
contacted the school.

19
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:13,000
"You must expel Kiyotaka
Ayanokoji immediately," he said.

20
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,000
Well now, I wonder what
his angle might have been.

21
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,666
I hope I'm not supposed
to know who it was.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,375
But we both know
you can't expel me

23
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,166
without good reason.

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,500
You're right.

00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,666
As long as you remain
a student at this school,

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,666
the rules protect you
from that injustice.

27
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,833
Of course, if you were
to cause any trouble...

28
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,875

But, unlike our

The sun. It's so near!

Your intentions are
irrelevant in this case.

If I decide that you've
become a problem,

37
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,750
then a problem is what you are.

38
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:57,125
Is that a threat?
Because it sounds like one.

39

Not a threat; it's a trade.

40

If you don't wanna get expelled,
then try to ascend to Class A.

And as long as you do your best,

I will cover for
you, unilaterally.

It would be wise to make
your decision with haste.

00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,125
Uh--

176
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,000
[STUDENT 8G]
He's the one who assaulted

177
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,791
those poor guys from Class B.

178
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,833
[STUDENT 8H]
He's got crazy eyes!

179
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,833
I hear he's actually
killed people.

180
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:57,750
Really?

181
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,083
[KEN]
Gimme a break, you guys!

182
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,291
Repeating your mistakes?

183
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:05,041
Do you intend to get yourself
into trouble again?

184
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,458
Don't get worked up. Let's go.

185
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,000
[AYANOKOJI]
Katsuragi, from Class A.

186
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:21,125
[HOSHINOMIYA moaning]

187
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,666
[sighs]

188
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,666
[HOSHINOMIYA]
Yeah, there we go.

189
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,500
Um, Ms. Hoshinomiya?

190
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,583
[HOSHINOMIYA]
Sorry, sorry. Go on.

191
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,125
You were saying?

192
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,458
[ICHINOSE] I think Sakayanagi
and Katsuragi from Class A,

193
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,958
and also Ryuen from Class C--

194
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,208
they're the ones we should
be keeping an eye on.

195
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,583
[HOSHINOMIYA]
And what about in Class D?

196
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,083
[ICHINOSE] Well, Horikita
and Hirata, for sure.

197
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,750
[HOSHINOMIYA] I feel like
there's someone else

198
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,375
from Class D, too, though.

199
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,833
[ICHINOSE]
I've heard rumors that Koenji

200
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,166
has really good grades,
and his athletic abilities

201
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,500
are apparently amazing,
but I don't know.

202
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,166
[HOSHINOMIYA]
No, it wasn't Koenji.

203
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,041
I know that much.

204
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,958
Are you thinking of Ayanokoji?

205
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,375
[HOSHINOMIYA] Yeah!
There's something about him.

206
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:07,291
My gut says to watch out.
He's on my list for sure.

207
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,291
But, Ms. Hoshinomiya,
I can't just go on

208
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,666
your gut instincts alone.

209
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,000
You're such a meanie!

210
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,458
A few days ago,
a man I won't mention,

211
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,708
contacted the school.

212
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:32,375
"You must expel Kiyotaka
Ayanokoji immediately," he said.

213
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,375
[doorbell rings]

214
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,625
Hirata?

215
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,875
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

216
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:41,625
No.

217
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,958
Good, I'm glad.

218
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,875
I'm about to go
hang out with Karuizawa

219
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,250
and a couple of her friends,

220
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,458
so do you wanna come with me?

221
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,291
Karuizawa?

222
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,333
I'll pass, thanks.

223
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,416
I don't really know her,
or any of her friends,

224
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,250
now that I actually
think about it.

225
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,041
This might be
a good opportunity.

226
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,125
No better time than the present.

227
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,375
[AYANOKOJI] Does he honestly
care about my social life

228
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:07,625
that much? Or is it
something else?

229
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,791
[gasps]

230
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,791
Ayanokoji.

231
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,083
The truth of it is,
there's something

232
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,000
I wanted to ask you
to help me with.

233
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,458
You want my help?

234
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,875
[HIRATA] Would you be willing
to act as a liaison

235
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,416
for me and Horikita?

236
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,125
I think if we want
to unite Class D

237
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,666
and make progress,

238
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,166
well, she'll be an integral
player in making that happen.

239
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,291
[AYANOKOJI]
So that's what this is about.

240
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,708
I've heard she's great.

241
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,750
That she's the one who
proved Sudo's innocence,

242
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,541
and that was no small feat.

243
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,708
If we could work togeth--

244
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:43,708
[phone rings]

245
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,416
[AYANOKOJI]
Shouldn't you answer that?

246
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,583
[HIRATA] Sorry. I guess
I'd better get going.

247
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,708
If you change your
mind and wanna join,

248
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,875
just call me and I'll let
you know where we are.

249
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,166
I'll do that.

250
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,416
Cool, later, then.

251
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,125
Hello?

252
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,458
Sorry. I'm on my way.

253
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,083
[SERVER 9B]
Sir! Please wait!

254
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,666
We'd prefer that you
dry off before

255
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,583
walking on the carpet
if you don't mind!

256
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,541
[laughs] Sorry to
break protocol,

257
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,166
but I've never toweled
off after swimming

258
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,333
in my entire life.

259
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,666
Sir, please listen to me!

260
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,541
So, would you say that I am,

261
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,541
"dripping with beauty"
or "manliness"?

262
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,916
[laughs] Beautiful!

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,958
[SERVER 9B]
Sir, I'm begging you!

264
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,041
[KOENJI grunts]

265
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,916
This is exactly what I deserve.

266
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,083
You sure got here quickly.

267
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,583
I did. What did
you summon me for?

268
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,083
To ask you a question.

269
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,791
Do you believe they'd
just give us a holiday?

270
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,875
[AYANOKOJI] I'm sure there's
some kind of catch.

271
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,458
[SUZUNE]
Go on.

272
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,416
I think we're
heading to an island.

273
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,166
The school owns it,
and there's a boarding house

274
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,708
on it big enough for
all the first-years.

275
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,958
When we get there...

276
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,041
We can't let our guard
down for a minute.

277
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,500
They're watching us.

278
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,583
[RYUEN] It would appear that
I have found you at last.

279
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,750
[RYUEN] You set up decoy
cameras in the special annex.

280
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,750
That was a clever little
prank you pulled, missy.

281
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,250
Sorry, I don't know who you are.

282
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,041
There's a special
place in my heart

283
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,458
for women like you, Suzune.

284
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,083
I don't know how you
accessed that information,

285
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,708
but I've never given you
permission to use my given name.

286
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,458
That's a nice expression.

287
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,041
I think it's incredibly sexy.

288
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,625
Like I said, I don't know you,
and I don't want to.

289
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,041
I find your presence
repulsive at best.

290
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm just one of
your devoted fans.

291
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,708
How dare you!

292
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,125
Next time, I'll deal
with you personally.

293
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,250
I'm so looking forward to it.

294
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,625
[IBUKI]
Ryuen!

295
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,208
[RYUEN]
Oh, Ibuki, it's you.

296
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,458
I need to have a talk
with you right now.

297
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,416
Heh, heh.

298
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,000
Missed me so much
you had to see me?

299
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,541
Don't be ridiculous!

300
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,041
I'm fed up with
the way you operate,

301
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,208
and I won't stand for it!

302
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,833
I see. That's all right.

303
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,125
We can talk about it
later in my room.

304
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,125
Just you and me.

305
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,333
[gasps]

306
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,708
[IBUKI]
Albert!

307
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,833
You're going along with this?

308
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,750
I see you've officially
become Ryuen's guard dog.

309
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,250
Get back here right now, Ryuen!

310
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,125
I'm not finished talking to you!

311
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,583
Let me go!

312
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,666
[groans]

313
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,291
That's enough.

314
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,875
[AYANOKOJI]
Hey. Are you okay?

315
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,458
It's none of your damn business.

316
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:12,833
[sighs] Class C seems to be
on the verge of collapse.

317
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,250
[KAMURO]
That's my full report.

318
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,083
I hope it's enough.

319
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,250
Thank you for all of your

320
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,958
thorough and diligent
work, Ms. Masumi.

321
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,125
[KAMURO]
What should I focus on now?

322
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,625
[SAKAYANAGI]
Good question.

323
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,708
I want you to investigate
some students.

324
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,333
[KAMURO]
Which ones?

325
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,333
That's check.

326
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,750
So that's what
I've been thinking.

327
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,416
How do you feel?

328
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,208
Um, would you ever want,
well, um, want to d--

329
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,625
d-date--

330
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,208
Sakura?

331
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,250
[screams]

332
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,208
What's wrong?

333
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,875
Um. Hi. Uh.

334
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,458
How long have you
been standing there?

335
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,958
I literally just got here.

336
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,166
Did you...

337
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,791
Did you hear what I
said before you spoke?

338
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:20,500
[AYANOKOJI]
No.

339
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,916
[sighs] Thank goodness.

340
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,958
[AYANOKOJI]
Why?

341
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,750
[gasps] Oh, um, I just...

342
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,083
Uh...

343
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,458
Is something going on with you?

344
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,833
No! No.

345
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,833
Nothing bad is going on
with me, exactly.

346
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,208
But I'm having trouble
making conversation

347
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,541
with our other classmates.

348
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:43,125
So, I'm sorry for asking
for your help with it.

349
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,458
[AYANOKOJI]
Don't be sorry.

350
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,458
[gasps]

351
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,208
If you just need
someone to listen,

352
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,333
that's something
I'm happy to do.

353
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,250
Thank you so much!

354
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,583
Sure.

355
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,958
It's not like it's
that big of a deal.

356
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,458
[KIKYO] Huh? Is that
Ayanokoji and Sakura?

357
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,583
See you later.

358
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,750
I'm going back to my room.

359
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,166
[KIKYO gasps]
Wait, come back!

360
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,250
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,333
I wanted to say hi, but I
should have left you two alone.

362
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,666
'S cool.

363
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,500
[AYANOKOJI] I guess Sakura
still hasn't overcome

364
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,208
her fear of strangers.

365
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:22,500
[KIKYO gasps]
What a beautiful, starry sky!

366
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,958
Right? It's pretty.
Don't you think so?

367
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,958
[AYANOKOJI] When Kushida
displays behavior like this,

368
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,458
it's easy to forget.

369
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,791
She was like a different
person that night.

370
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,541
Well, I'd better
get back to my room.

371
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,708
Are you done for
the night already?

372
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,458
Yeah, I'm gettin' very sleepy.

373
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,875
Sounds good.

374
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,125
I guess I'll see
you tomorrow, then.

375
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,458
Have a good night!

376
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,541
Yeah, thanks, same to you.

377
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,750
Hold on.

378
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,958
Kushida?

379
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,458
You're wary of me
now, aren't you?

380
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,916
I knew you were.

381
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,875
I can always sense
that sort of thing.

382
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,208
Sorry.

383
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:24,250
When people leave me all
by myself, I get kind of lonely.

384
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,708
I thought that maybe you were...

385
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,541
Never mind, it's nothing.

386
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,000
Forget about it!

387
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,125
[PA dings]

388
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,750
[ANN]
Good morning, students!

389
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,458
Time to rise and shine!

390
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,875
Our island destination
will soon be in view!

391
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,750
We hope you'll take
a few minutes to bask

392
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,541
in the sight of this highly
significant scenery.

393
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,541
Don't let the moment
pass you by!

394
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,000
Significant scenery?

395
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,625
Dang! Get a load of it!

396
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,416
Good morning! Isn't
this so exciting?

397
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,250
Yeah. Good morning.

398
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,291
It's simply breathtaking.

399
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,541
Don't you think it's
beautiful, too, Ayanokoji?

400
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,541
[AYANOKOJI]
The usual Kushida.

401
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,833
By the way, have you seen
Horikita this morning?

402
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:36,708
Why ask?

403
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,583
I thought she would be with you.

404
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,833
I haven't.

405
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,375
She doesn't quite
seem like the type

406
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,958
to revel in a vacation.

407
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,708
So she's probably in her room.

408
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,500
I bet you're right.

409
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,458
As we make preparations
to disembark on the island.

410
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,125
We'll brief you on
what you can expect

411
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,291
once we dock.

412
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,208
Until then, you're
required to wait here.

413
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,333
It's so hot. I wish
they'd speed things up.

414
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,583
Have you been in your room?

415
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,250
Yes. I was reading, what of it?

416
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,583
It was extremely engaging, too.

417
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,875
But, since we're
not allowed to bring

418
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,250
our personal belongings,
I won't get to finish.

419
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,625
Anyway, what is this?

420
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,916
We'll confiscate
your student IDs.

421
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,375
In their place, you will
wear these wristwatches.

422
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,208
Those who take them
off without permission

423
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,000
will be severely penalized.

424
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,250
They're all acting
especially cautious.

425
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,166
Like they're on high alert.

426
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,625
I agree.

427
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,458
I can't imagine
they'd go this far

428
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,500
if we were just here for
a little fun on the beach.

429
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,875
I'm Mashima, the
instructor for Class A.

430
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,458
To begin with, I'd like
to express my gratitude

431
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,041
that we all made it
to the island.

432
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,750
Almost all of us.

433
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,166
One of you won't be able to
join because of an illness,

434
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,958
and that's a real shame.

435
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,666
Without further ado,

436
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,041
I'm glad to announce
the beginning

437
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,541
of this year's
special examination.

438
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,416
Huh?

439
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,958
Special examination?

440
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,750
The duration of the
test is one week.

441
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,958
You'll live as a group
on the picturesque

442
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,541
desert island you
see before you.

443
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,375
You are your own responsibility
from here on out,

444
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,875
so you're expected
to behave accordingly.

445
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:31,666
Now! The test
of survival begins!

446
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,000
[AYANOKOJI]
Looks like vacation's over.

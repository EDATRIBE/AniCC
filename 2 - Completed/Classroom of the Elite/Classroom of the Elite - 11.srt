1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:15,375
[bell ringing]

2
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,833
[SHINO] We need to segregate
the girls' and boys' areas.

3
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,875
We should move the boys'
tent somewhere else,

4
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,291
and then make the girls'
off-limit to the boys.

5
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,250
I don't know.

6
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,333
[IKE]
What would that solve?

7
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,500
If that's what you want,

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,083
then you guys should
move it yourselves.

9
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,708
'Cause I'm sure
as hell not gonna!

10
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,291
We weren't even asking
for your help, jerk!

11
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,125
Hirata, you would help us
move it, wouldn't you?

12
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,625
Yeah, of course.

13
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:48,166
I'll do it, but I think that
it's gonna take a little while.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,000
[sighs]

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,708
I have no objections
to separating

16
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,291
the boys from the girls.

17
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,125
But, while he's in the
process of moving it,

18
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,375
Hirata would have access to both

19
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,583
the boys' and girls'
areas, right?

20
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,166
Yeah, and what's your point?

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,166
[SUZUNE] I don't think he can
be trusted to do it by himself.

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,041
[SHINO]
Hirata isn't like that!

23
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,791
Well, he is a boy,
nevertheless.

24
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,166
[gasps]

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,791
We should add another
guy to the tent detail.

26
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,166
That will double the
manpower effectively,

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,208
and the other benefit
is that the two boys

28
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,833
can keep an eye on each other.

29
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,583
But, that won't work.

30
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:23,333
There's no way we can trust
any of the boys besides Hirata.

31
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,208
There's someone else.

32
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,833
[sighs]

33
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:30,291
And it's him. Ayanokoji.

34
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,583
Well, that's wonderful.
Trusted by default.

35
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,541
Look at it this way, it's a
compliment from Horikita.

36
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,958
And Karuizawa thought
it was a good idea, too.

37
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,208
Well, I wouldn't put it
quite like that.

38
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,916
Your girlfriend said that
I was pretty much invisible.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,625
I didn't raise any red flags.

40
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,916
[HIRATA chuckles]

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,541
[MIT]
Hirata!

42
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,250
Sorry, could you come
here for a minute?

43
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,875
Uh, yeah, I'll be right there.

44
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,750
[AYANOKOJI]
I can handle the rest of this.

45
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,875
You go ahead.

46
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,083
Sorry. Thanks for your help.

47
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,666
[tapping]

48
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,708
[AYANOKOJI] The boys' tent
is officially moved.

49
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,875
Can you talk for a sec?

50
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,375
Class D seems to be
having trouble.

51
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,750
I guess we've all got our
fair share of problems.

52
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,958
Regardless of the reason
behind it, as a girl,

53
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,208
I can't abide underwear theft.

54
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,250
It's perverted. Unforgivable.

55
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,708
Who do you think was
responsible for it?

56
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,541
You thought it was
me, didn't you?

57
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,041
I'm an outsider, so naturally,
you all suspect me.

58
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,125
Sudo's not the only one.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,041
[AYANOKOJI] That's the truth.
Just look at them.

60
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,041
They're over there,
glaring at you.

61
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,041
[IBUKI]
Of course he is.

62
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,208
Why shouldn't they
all be wary of me?

63
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,750
If I were in the same position,
I wouldn't trust me, either.

64
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,458
[AYANOKOJI] For what
it's worth, I trust you.

65
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,208
Wow. Thank you.

66
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,375
That was honestly the last thing
I expected you to say.

67
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,708
I was only telling
you the truth.

68
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,666
Looks like I'll be dining
by myself tonight.

69
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,916
[SUZUNE] How's it feel, getting
forced into menial labor?

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,791
You've got some nerve.

71
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,958
If it weren't for you butting
in, it wouldn't have happened,

72
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,791
and I could have lived
today in peace.

73
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,375
What was I supposed to do?

74
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,708
I couldn't trust
Hirata by himself.

75
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,958
I needed you as insurance.

76
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,041
You know what?

77
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,291
Not everyone is hiding
some evil side.

78
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,791
Some people are open books.

79
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,125
I guess that's true.

80
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,541
Take me for instance:
I have nothing to hide.

81
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,791
But, still.

82
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,958
Most people'd do anything
to keep the world

83
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,500
from knowing their
innermost thoughts.

84
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,500
I know that's how you work.

85
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,291
And, because the
virtuous are often

86
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,833
the most hypocritical,

87
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,458
I think I'm wise
not to trust him.

88
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,791
[AYANOKOJI] Then why don't
you just come clean, already?

89
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,541
I don't know what
you're talking about.

90
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,875
[AYANOKOJI]
Come on.

91
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,791
You haven't been feeling
well since the test began.

92
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,791
You don't have to
hide it from me.

93
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,583
I feel perfectly fine.

94
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,000
[AYANOKOJI]
Hypocrite.

95
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,333
[gasps]

96
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,250
You better get your hand off me.

97
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,000
Just stop moving.

98
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,750
Almost 38 degrees Celsius. Huh.

99
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,750
What are you, a thermometer?

100
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,166
When we all met up on the
ship before the test,

101
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,041
I asked where you'd been.
Remember what you said?

102
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,125
Yeah, I told you that I'd
been in my room, reading.

103
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,583
You weren't resting in your room
because you felt sick?

104
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,375
This could hurt our score.

105
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,583
Do you plan to tell the others?

106
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,625
I've already held out for
five days at this point.

107
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:09,416
If I tell them about it now,
it'd be for nothing.

108
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,166
[IKE] I thought it
might rain overnight,

109
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,833
but those clouds look ominous.

110
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,041
I wish we had a boat
or something.

111
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,958
A break from the sun
is kinda nice, though.

112
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,416
[SUZUNE]
There are some dark storm clouds

113
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,000
coming in fast
from the southwest.

114
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,416
Weather's gonna get bad.

115
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,708
Get ready for things
to take an ugly turn.

116
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,583
Huh.

117
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,541
What?

118
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,458
Oh. It's nothing.

119
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,000
We'd better hurry up
and gather food

120
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,958
before it starts to pour. Right!

121
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,958
And I'm about to gather up
a storm, uh, no pun intended.

122
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,833
Ike's become pretty reliable.

123
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:48,833
You'd better step it up

124
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,333
if you wanna prove
your usefulness.

125
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,083
Yeah, same to you.

126
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,583
We've got a lot to gather.

127
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,583
If we're gonna secure a day's
rations for everyone,

128
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,583
we've gotta work fast.

129
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,791
Duh.

130
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,541
So, why are we still
standing around talking?

131
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,000
[sighs]

132
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,250
[YAMAUCHI]
Let's see. Fruit, fruit, fruit.

133
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,875
Where's the fruit?

134
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,250
Is there something
bothering you, Kushida?

135
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,791
I'm just thinking about
Ayanokoji and Horikita.

136
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,708
They've always been
close, haven't they?

137
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,416
I wonder what it is
about the two of them

138
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,625
that lends itself
to such intimacy.

139
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,875
[YAMAUCHI] That's true,
now that you mention it.

140
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,750
Are you ready to do this?

141
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,666
Okay, let's spread it out.

142
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,750
Hey, Horikita.

143
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,125
What is it now?

144
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,666
[AYANOKOJI]
This is important.

145
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,375
It's about the class's key card.

146
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,500
What are you doing
to take care of it?

147
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,541
I keep it on me at all times.

148
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,333
Then, when it's time
to renew the spot,

149
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,625
I do it with the other
students surrounding me.

150
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,791
As was agreed upon.

151
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,958
As for Ibuki and
the other classes,

152
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,666
there's no reason that they
would be able to identify me.

153
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,875
Would you mind if I
took a quick look at it?

154
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,541
[gasps] Here? Seriously?

155
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,166
It would actually be best
for us to do it here.

156
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,541
Taking it out at
base camp is risky.

157
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,250
I guess, but still.

158
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,416
Why do you want to?

159
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,625
What's the point of it?

160
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,041
Here's the truth:

161
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,958
on the first day of the test,
I saw a student holding

162
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,500
what I thought looked
like a key card.

163
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,166
A Class A guy.

164
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,458
The thing is,

165
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,041
I have no way of knowing
if it was, in fact,

166
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,583
a real key card or not.

167
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,250
'Cause I've never actually seen
one of them up close before.

168
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,666
That's true.

169
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,833
What you saw wouldn't
be positive proof

170
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,000
if you didn't have a reliable
point of reference.

171
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,166
Well, then?

172
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,250
Dunno. I still can't say.

173
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,291
I thought I'd know for certain
after I saw it myself,

174
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,500
but the color
might be different.

175

I'm not sure.

176
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,583
It's also possible
that the school gave

177
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,791
each of the classes
different color cards.

178
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,000

Hey! Why would you do
something like that?

187
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,833
C'mon.

to defend her honor. Y'know?

Right, Ayanokoji?

[KIKYO] Oh, Horikita.
You're covered in mud!

cleaned off right away!

stay like this, can I?

Were you trying to kill him?

197
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,791
If I hadn't reacted,
you could have split

Maybe we should
take a dip in the river,

a mess from working.

from the foraging team

it for a while, huh?

could come take a walk

214

00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,791
We can't talk freely here.

What is this about?

217
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,458
You wanted me to go
into the forest with you

218
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,666
and search for more
food, or something?

I tell you this with full
knowledge of my mistake.

00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,125
Something was taken.

[AYANOKOJI]
Wait a minute.

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,000
You're not telling me
that your underwear

228
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,750
was stolen, too, are you?

229

No, it's much worse than that.

230
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,875
What I'm telling you is...

231
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,583
The class key card was stolen.

233
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,750
I don't think we
should tell anyone.

234

For right now, let's
keep it to ourselves.

235

Just until we know
the extent of things.

236
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:28,791
[SUZUNE]
Yes.

237
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,000
If everyone else found out,

238
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,791
it would throw them
into a panic.

239
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,083
And that's the last thing
we need to happen now.

240
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,833
I have two suspects
in mind already.

241
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,208
It's either Karuizawa,
or Ibuki, which is more likely.

242
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,208
[AYANOKOJI]
Are things really that bad

243
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,125
between you and Karuizawa?

In ways someone like
you would never see.

00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,500
Ways that were inevitable.

246
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,541
If you say so, but I
seriously doubt it was her.

247
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,916
She's been in line
for the shower

248
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,916
since before you
went to clean up.

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,500
[SUZUNE]
You're sure about that?

250
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,125
Yeah. Saw her with my own eyes.

251
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,875
Well, then. Ibuki's the culprit.

252
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,625
We should find the right time,
and then ask her flat out.

253
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,166
Worst case scenario would be

254
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,500
if she took it and
ran off with it.

255
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,333
That's true.

256
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm so sorry.

257
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,583
I think it's best if
you head back first.

00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,750
I can catch up with
you a little later.

259
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,125
Sure.

260

It's an unbelievable failure.

261

wants to crawl off somewhere.

do it, after all?

happening around here?

275

Does it mean we have
a traitor in class

to distract us from it!

[IBUKI]
I don't know what you mean.

348
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,791
[panting]

349
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:33,708
[SUZUNE] My limbs feel
so heavy, and I'm hot.

350
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,958
No, am I cold?

351
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,666
Things aren't looking
very good for me.

352
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,333
But I don't care.

353
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,583
I'm gonna tell you
one more time.

354
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,333
Give it back to me right now.

355
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,583
Take whatever you want.

356
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,291
Hey. You're fast.

357
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,833
You could get disqualified
for doing that.

358
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,208
Disqualified by whom?

359
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,291
No one's here to see it. Anyway.

360
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,875
I think you came
looking for a fight!

361
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,375
Nice. You've done this
before, haven't you?

362
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,625
[SUZUNE] If I can't get it back,
I'll let Class D down

363
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,458
in the worst possible way.

364
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,916
I looked down my nose
at all of them.

365
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,500
Called them worthless
and stupid.

366
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,958
When, all along, at the end
of the day, I'm useless.

367
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:37,125
A failure, resorting to
violence. It's pathetic.

368
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,833
Just admit it was you.

369
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,000
You're the one who
stole the key card.

370
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,750
Since you've worked so hard,
I guess I'll tell you.

371
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,333
Yes. I'm the one who stole
your precious card.

372
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,791
I expected to have to work a
lot harder to get it out of you.

373
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,208
You can't say I used violence.

374
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,625
There's no proof.
That's too bad.

375
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,500
If I got that card,

376
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,041
I could analyze
your fingerprints.

377
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,166
And then I could prove that
you stole the underwear, too.

378
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,083
[SUZUNE] If I can just
get her off balance.

379
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,208
[panting]

380
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,666
[IBUKI grunting]

381
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,083
[IBUKI] I've been convinced
of this for a while.

382
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,958
I thought for sure you were
involved in it somehow.

383
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,916
The fire at the camp earlier.

384
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,833
Why do you think
I would be so evasive

385
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,333
when talking to you?

386
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,125
I just wanted to confirm my
suspicions about you first.

387
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,333
[SUZUNE gasps]
Do you mean...?

388
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,791
[IBUKI yells]

389
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,750
I've gotta go.

390
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,208
I have another
appointment now, you see.

391
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,500
This was a nice talk.
But it's over.

392
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:21,250
[rustling]

393
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,333
Oh, the item that
you requested?

394
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,833
I got it for you.

1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:18,750
[bell ringing]

2
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,750
Ah! Hey, stop splashing me!

3
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:32,875
Couldn't help myself.

4
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,791
It doesn't hurt
to have some fun!

5
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,250
Fine. Bring it on!

6
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,041
[AYANOKOJI]
Ah, free time during swim class.

7
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,166
People have naturally
broken up into groups,

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,000
which makes sense, I guess.

9
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,666
It's official.

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,041
I have utterly failed
at making friends.

11
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,625
I'm destined to be a loner.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,500
[sighs]

13
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,125
[SUZUNE] What are you
brooding about over here?

14
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,500
Oh, I was just embroiled in
a painful internal struggle.

15
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,833
How can these losers
even enjoy themselves?

16
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,250
You'd think that they
would be more deflated.

17
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,708
Maybe that's how
these guys cope.

18
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,583
They wanna have some fun,
while they still can.

19
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,291
You could be right, I guess.

20
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,291
[KIKYO]
Hey, stop it! [laughs]

21
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,041
[SUZUNE] They sure are
having a good time.

22
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,708
It's early in the spring
for swimming to start,

23
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,291
and they're first years
on a free class period.

24
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,875
It's normal for them to enjoy
themselves, don't you think?

25
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,250
They're like a bunch of
grade school kids.

26
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,083
Although, I suppose I can't
really fault them for it.

27
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,875
But in the S-system,

28
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,000
they're going to suffer
for that attitude.

29
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,208
But aren't you and I
just like them?

30
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,708
Maybe.

31
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,583
[AYANOKOJI]
The S-system...

32
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,625
Indeed, this is called
the S-system.

33
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,125
It evaluates students
in real time,

34
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,250
and assigns numerical value.

35
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,000
Observe. Class D has
thoroughly proven

36
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,666
that you deserve to be
ranked dead last.

37
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,041
You truly are the
worst of the worst.

38
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,500
Zero?

39
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,500
[SUZUNE growls]

40
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,875
[clapping]

41
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:45,208
However, I am rather
impressed with this class.

42
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,208
Never in the history of this
school has a class blown through

43
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,875
all of their points in the first
month, not even Class D.

44
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,958
Excuse me, will you
at least tell us what

45
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,666
the school's criteria is for
gaining and losing points?

46
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,500
You're preparing for the
real world, so figure it out.

47
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,875
In the workforce, you're
expected to come to the table

48
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,125
knowing what to do.

49
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,916
On the board, I have written

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,791
the current scores held
by all first-year classes.

51
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,125
For every point the class
gets, 100 private points

52
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,791
are distributed to each
student individually.

53
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,791
When the school year began,
each first-year class

54
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,375
was allotted 1,000
collective points.

55
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:25,333
To be frank, you people
lost every point you had.

56
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:31,000
Teacher. Will we get the
chance to earn any points back?

57
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,375
Of course.

58
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,541
And in doing so, if you earn
more points than Class C

59
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,791
you'll be promoted
up to Class C,

60
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,458
and Class C will be
downgraded to D.

61
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,666
Your earliest opportunity
to do this

62
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,666
is coming up in the midterms.
Depending on your scores,

63
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,458
you can earn as many as
100 points for the class.

64
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,208
A hundred measly points?

65
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,750
Yeah, but it's better
than nothing, right?

66
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,541
[CHABASHIRA]
However...

67
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,708
...these are the grades from
the most recent quiz you took.

68
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:02,333
And, as you can see,
they are complete garbage.

69
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,083
From this point forward,

70
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,250
anyone who receives
a failing grade

71
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:11,250
on any midterms or finals will
be expelled immediately.

72
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,541
Considering this most recent
development, everyone in class

73
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,000
is gonna have to completely
change their habits.

74
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,375
And that's only to get us
a few meager points.

75
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,208
So, if everyone doesn't
ace the midterms,

76
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,916
we're all going to
be royally screwed.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,250
That's right.

78
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,041
Even more than that,
if we're going to measure up

79
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,500
and achieve the high college
entry and employment rates

80
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,708
they promised us, we're going
to have to push ourselves

81
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,291
from here on out to
overtake Class C.

82
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,583
Beating Class C has to
be the primary goal now.

83
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:51,250
'Cause if we can't even do that,
we have no hope of advancing.

84
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:55,541
Were you just doing an
impression of Chabashira?

85
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,916
No, why?

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,791
Sounded like her. A little.

87
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,958
[gasps]

88
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,375
[SUZUNE]
I was wondering.

89
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,666
Do you play sports or something?

90
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,166
No, not at all.

91
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,833
In fact, in middle school,
I did nothing extracurricular.

92
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,583
That makes no sense.

93
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,291
Your forearms are so muscular,
I thought you must.

94
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,750
[KIKYO]
Hey, there, Horikita!

95
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,208
Do you maybe wanna
come swim with us?

96
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,750
Would you please go away?

97
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,041
[KIKYO]
You don't have to be mean.

98
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,458
Are you a bad swimmer
or something?

99
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,833
No, I am an incredibly
average swimmer.

100
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,291
[KIKYO] Back in middle school, I
was probably the worst swimmer

101
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,208
in the whole wide world! But
then I practiced really hard,

102
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,458
and nowadays I don't think
I'm that bad at all!

103
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,166
Wow. That's fascinating.

104
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,583
[AYANOKOJI]
She's totally aloof, isn't she?

105
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,250
I do wish I could find a way
to get along with her better.

106
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,833
[HIRATA]
Hey, guys.

107
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,625
Do you have a minute
to talk about something?

108
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,208
We didn't get any
points again today,

109
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,875
and that has got to change.

110
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,416
I don't want this
problem to haunt us

111
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,291
for the rest of our
time at this school.

112
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,583
We have to do something
to turn this around.

113
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,791
There's no way I want to go
all the way to graduation

114
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,375
without earning any more points.

115
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,708
[KARUIZAWA] I agree,
we can't let that happen!

116
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,541
You're right, and we won't.
We'll turn this around.

117
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,333
Next month, we're going
to get more points

118
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,791
than any other class.

119
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,041
I don't know why you keep
saying, "we," like that.

120
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,166
Seriously. You can
leave me out of it!

121
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,458
[MANABU]
Class D again.

122
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,750
You're both in Class A.

123
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,208
Sakayanagi... and Katsuragi.

124
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,583
[MANABU]
Congratulations are in order.

125
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:43,291
Your class earned a total
of 940 points this month.

126
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,625
Quite a feat.

127
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,416
I do hope you're both
very proud of yourselves.

128
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,208
[MANABU]
Now, then.

129
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,583
How much do you know
about the S-system?

130
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,666
[YAMAUCHI]
Hey, Doc! You're my best friend.

131
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,166
You gotta help me out!

132
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,041
Buy this console from
me for 20,000 points?

133
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,708
Actually, it's so funny.

134
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,666
I spent all my points
on accessories

135
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,500
so I'm totally broke now.
I was thinking about borrowing

136
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,500
a couple of points from
all the girls in class

137
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,833
to buy the essentials.

138
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,458
You're one of my best
friends, aren't you?

139
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,166
[SUZUNE]
Do you have any plans for lunch?

140
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,500
I was wondering if you would
be able to join me.

141
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,000
[gasps]

142
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,333
[AYANOKOJI]
Well, let's eat, then.

143
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,958
Thank you for the food.

144
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,208
I have to ask...
Are you sure it's okay

145
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,208
that I put this super expensive
lunch on your tab?

146
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,750
I feel awkward.

147
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,208
Yes. I told you to get whatever
you wanted, and I meant it.

148
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,750
Lunch today is my treat.
So don't feel awkward.

149
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,083
[AYANOKOJI]
What now?

150
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,500
Is something wrong
with you, Ayanokoji?

151
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,208
Dig in, already.

152
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,666
Right.

153
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,125
Now, listen, I want you to hear
me out on something important.

154
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,791
I'm aware that
Hirata and the others

155
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,916
worked out a plan of
action earlier today.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,916
They're all forming
a study group.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,375
Their goal is to make sure
they ace the test.

158
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,916
A study group?

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,833
[SUZUNE] Yes. But three of our
classmates refused to join,

160
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:07,125
and it just so happens they're
the ones with the lowest scores.

161
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,375
Sudo, right?

162
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,041
Yes, and Yamauchi
and Ike, as well.

163
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,708
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

164
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,500
Those three never did strike
me as the studious type.

165
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,791
I don't see how anyone
could fail a test.

166
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,916
Nevertheless, the
fact remains--they did.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,166
There are kids out there who
don't even know what it means

168
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,458
to be a good student.

169
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,875
I guess some people
really are that pathetic.

170
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,500
That's cold. Don't you
have any sympathy?

171
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,625
Would being sympathetic
keep it from being true?

172
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,041
If we don't do something,

173
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,541
they're most likely
going to fail.

174
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,458
And if we want to
overtake Class C,

175
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,666
not only do we have to stop our
class from hemorrhaging points,

176
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,833
but we've also got to do
everything in our power

177
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,541
to start gaining them back.

178
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,416
Are you saying you want
to start a study group, too?

179
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,041
You're willing to
help Sudo, Ike,

180
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,416
and Yamauchi get good
grades on the midterm?

181
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,416
Yes.

182
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,583
Seriously?

183
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,666
Of course. If left to
their own devices,

184
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,041
they'll sink, and bring the
rest of Class D with them.

185
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,125
I may have to be relegated
to the lowest class in school,

186
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,583
but not for long. I will
claw my way up to Class A.

187
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,916
Hey, wait a minute.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,166
What now?

189
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,875
Did you just say you
want to be Class A?

190
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,083
You heard right.

191
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,791
You sure you didn't
mean Class C?

192
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,125
[SUZUNE]
I meant what I said.

193
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,458
I find my assignment to
Class D utterly offensive

194
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,458
and unacceptable.
I intend to change it.

195
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,583
So, step one is to
rehabilitate the failures?

196
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,458
Since you've grasped that,
you can guess what's next.

197
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,708
I'd rather not.

198
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,541
Do you enjoy your lunch?

199
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,250
An extravagant meal like
that doesn't come free.

200
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,541
Even an idiot could see

201
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,958
you're expected to provide
something in return.

202
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,250
And don't think I've forgiven
you for conspiring with

203
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,541
Kushida and taking me to that
café under false pretenses.

204
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,208
That was foul play.

205
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,625
That's not cool.

206
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,083
If you want to make it up to me,

207
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,833
then you'll work with me to
help save the whole class.

208
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,958
Your job will be to round
up those three losers,

209
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,166
and convince them to
join my study group.

210
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,666
Here's my phone
number and email.

211
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,958
All right, contact me if you
need anything along the way,

212
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,625
but don't think you can
reach out whenever you want.

213
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,208
[AYANOKOJI] This is how
I get a girl's number

214
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,583
for the first time in
high school? Pathetic.

215
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,083
I'm not even happy
that she gave it to me,

216
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,208
but I'd better save it, anyway.

217
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,875
[AYANOKOJI]
I guess I have to comply,

218
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,833
even though I technically
never agreed to this.

219
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,708
[AYANOKOJI]
Well. Here goes nothin'.

220
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:28,750
Leave me alone.

221
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,250
Yeah... no.

222
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,250
The hell'd you say to me, punk?!

223
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,166
I knew it was hopeless.

224
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,583
Maybe I could enlist help from
someone who can get through

225
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:41,875
to those three. I should have
done that to begin with.

226
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,541
I wonder if she's
home right now.

227
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,416
I can call her room.

228
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,000
[AYANOKOJI] Hi, can you connect
me to Kikyo Kushida's room?

229
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,083
Yes, from Class One-D.

230
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,000
[AYANOKOJI] Yes, it is about
something school-related.

231
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,583
Yes.

232
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,750
[phone rings]

233
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,916
--[blow dryer hums]
--[KIKYO] Um, hello?

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,083
Hi, this is... Hold on.

235
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,500
What's that weird noise?

236
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,291
[KIKYO]
Oh, Ayanokoji?

237
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,833
[click]

238
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:14,500
[KIKYO] Sorry, was it too loud?
I just got out of the bath.

239
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,041
I was blow-drying my
hair, sorry about that.

240
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,625
You caught me a
little off-guard.

241
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,833
I've never used the dorm's
internal land line before,

242
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,125
so I was startled.

243
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,541
[AYANOKOJI]
I'm amazed you answered.

244
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,625
Anyway, rejoice, Kushida.

245
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,458
I've selected you as a
good will ambassador.

246
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,083
It's for the good of the class,
so I know you'll do your best.

247
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,458
[gasps] What do you mean? Uh...

248
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,708
[KIKYO]
Right. Wow.

249
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,875
A second study group for
Sudo, Ike, and Yamauchi?

250
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,958
Run by Horikita, herself?

251
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,375
Well, when a friend needs help,
I always answer the call,

252
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,500
no matter what it might be.
I'll do whatever it takes!

253
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,000
[AYANOKOJI]
You don't have to, you know.

254
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,000
I think it's cruel that
anyone who fails

255
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,833
gets expelled immediately.

256
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,583
The thought of having to say
goodbye so soon, especially

257
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:01,416
after we just got to know each
other? I mean, that's awful.

258
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Oh! I do have one request.

259
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,333
In exchange for
helping you guys,

260
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,125
I want to join the
study group, too.

261
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,250
Would that be okay?

262
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,083
Uh, are you sure
that's all you want?

263
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,750
[KIKYO] Yeah! I want to help
the cause in any way.

264
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,291
Let's see... Oh!

265
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,875
Why don't I give you
my cell phone number

266
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,500
so you can contact me whenever,

267
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,500
instead of just when
I'm in my room.

268
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,125
[AYANOKOJI]
You're cool with that?

269
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,541
Yeah! I mean, we're
classmates, right?

270
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,625
Sorry I didn't give it
to you until now.

271
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,791
I just didn't think of it.

272
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,000
You can reach out
anytime you want.

273
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,583
I've got Kushida's phone number.

274
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,750
[phone chimes]

275
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,291
Uh? Wow, she works
like lightning.

276
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,166
Good job, Kushida.

277
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,708
[AYANOKOJI]
And... sent.

278
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,541
[AYANOKOJI gasps]

279
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,750
--Hel--?
--[SUZUNE] No.

280
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,416
[beeping]

281
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,416
[ringing]

282
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,458
Can you at least hear
me out for a minute--?

283
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,875
[beeping]

284
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,333
[phone chimes]

285
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:17,291
[ringing]

286
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,458
[phone chimes]

287
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,125
[gasps]

288
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,250
[AYANOKOJI sighs]
Are you kidding me?

289
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,708
What do you mean "what"?

290
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,875
I thought I was being
perfectly clear.

291
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,416
You should be glad.

292
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,166
All three of them have agreed
to come to the study group,

293
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,625
including Sudo!

294
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,000
Thanks to Kushida, your
little plan just might work.

295
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,708
[AYANOKOJI]
I hadn't even sent that yet!

296
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,375
[KIKYO] I understand.
Is that her final word?

297
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,333
[AYANOKOJI] Yeah. Even after
you helped make it happen.

298
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,166
I'm really sorry.

299
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,958
[KIKYO grunts]
Right! It's okay!

300
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,000
You just let me handle her
from here on out.

301
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,458
[bang]

302
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,458
[KEN]
Call me incompetent again!

303
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,750
Well, if you don't know
how to solve a simple

304
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,291
simultaneous equation, I
don't know how to proceed.

305
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,708
I shudder to think of what
the future holds for you.

306
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,291
[KEN growls]

307
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,375
Sudo, stop!

308
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,625
Who needs algebra, anyway?

309
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,583
When am I ever gonna
use it, huh?

310
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,666
If I wanted to prepare for
my future, I'm better off

311
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,333
playing basketball to get ready
for a career in the pros,

312
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,208
not sticking my
nose in some book.

313
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,375
Really?

314
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,583
Delusional.

315
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,708
<i>You</i> playing pro basketball?

316
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,000
Do you even have an inkling
of how difficult it is

317
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,500
to get to that level?

318
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,958
It requires commitment and
dedication that you sorely lack.

319
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,583
Face it, you don't
have what it takes.

320
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,750
I didn't skip practice to
come here and get insulted.

321
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,708
I knew this was a
waste of my time.

322
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,416
You know what. I'm out, too.

323
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,958
Horikita might be smart, but I
don't want help from someone

324
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,416
so condescending. I'd rather
fail than be treated like crap.

325
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,708
[YAMAUCHI]
Yeah, same here!

326
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,875
If you want to get
expelled, be my guest.

327
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,875
See how much I care.

328
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,166
[AYANOKOJI] I left it to you,
like you said, Kushida,

329
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,500
and look what happened.
Do something.

330
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,333
Look, Horikita. No one's
going to study with you

331
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,375
if you make them feel stupid
when they make a mistake.

332
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,166
Yes, I can acknowledge that
I was wrong about them.

333
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,291
It's clear to me that this

334
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,625
is all a fruitless
waste of my time.

335
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,250
[KIKYO]
What do you mean?

336
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,041
I mean that if those idiots are
going to drag us down with them,

337
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,250
we're better off without.
I say, "good riddance."

338
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,125
I see.

339
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,041
Okay, then. I'll work it
out with them myself.

340
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,500
I promise.

341
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,333
I don't think we should give
up on our friends so soon,

342
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,083
and it'd be sad if those
three got expelled.

343
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,458
I won't abandon them, and I
think you'd rather not, either.

344
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,166
That's why you started this
group in the first place.

345
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,875
If you're being
sincere right now,

346
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,916
then I appreciate
the sentiment. I do.

347
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,458
Tell me, why did
you really agree

348
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,958
to help us in this endeavor?

349
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,208
[KIKYO gasps]

350
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,541
[SUZUNE] Are you just
trying to sabotage me?

351
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,250
I can't believe you.
Do you really think that?

352
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,958
I'm not an underhanded person.

353
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,750
The fact that you would
even assume that about me

354
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,083
makes me feel so sad for you.

355
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,500
It's awful, and I hope you
don't mean all that.

356
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,750
I need to go get
some fresh air.

357
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,375
[MANABU]
Suzune.

358
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,666
I'm amazed you had the
brains to track me down.

359
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,875
[SUZUNE]
Listen, brother.

360
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,125
I'm not the failure
that I was in the past.

361
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,583
I followed you because I want
to prove that I've changed.

362
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,625
[AYANOKOJI] That's Horikita,
but who's she with?

363
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,125
"Brother"?

364
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,541
Prove you've changed?

365
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,583
Hardly. After all this time,

366
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,083
you clearly have
not come to terms

367
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,125
with your own shortcomings.

368
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,958
You're foolish to think you
could succeed here, leave now.

369
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,541
You're wrong! I'm going
to be in Class A soon.

370
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,416
Then you'll see!

371
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,750
Don't bother.

372
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,375
I promise.

373
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,416
I know I can make it.

374
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,750
You're an irrational
little brat.

375
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,000
[AYANOKOJI]
The student council president?

376
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,583
[SUZUNE gasps]

377
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,583
[MANABU] Do you ever stop
to think of the shame you

378
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,708
bring this family? My own
little sister in Class D.

379
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,166
Pathetic.

380
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,333
Withdraw from school if you
know what's good for you.

381
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,375
Brother, please just listen.

382
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,333
[MANABU] You don't have
the right to better yourself,

383
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:37,041
nor do you have the ability to
do so. Someday you'll learn.

384
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,041
Ayanokoji, don't!

385
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,375
Seriously?

386
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,083
You really were planning
to hurt her, weren't you?

387
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,041
You better let her go, now.

388
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,041
Go away. This doesn't
concern you.

389
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,583
[gasps]

390
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,458
[AYANOKOJI] She sounds like a
completely different person.

391
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,416
[AYANOKOJI]
Close one.

392
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,583
[gasps]

393
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,208
You fight like an expert.

394
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,416
Which of the arts
do you practice?

395
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,416
Piano and calligraphy.

396
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,750
Ah. Now I get it.

397
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:16,000
I think I know who you are.
I'd heard there was a student

398
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,708
who got 50s on all
of his entrance exams.

399
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,166
The other day, you got a
50 on one of your quizzes

400
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,208
in class, as well.

401
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,666
[gasps]

402
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,333
[MANABU] Are you trying to
make some kind of statement,

403
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,333
scoring exactly half of what
you should at this school?

404
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,625
Wow, that's a
strange coincidence.

405
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,000
[SUZUNE gasping]

406
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,041
[MANABU] You pride yourself
on being unique, I see.

407
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,500
Suzune.

408
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,208
I'm surprised you've
made a friend,

409
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,541
although I assume you
had to bribe him.

410
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,708
You're wrong.
He isn't my friend,

411
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:46,458
he's just a classmate. I don't
need any friends, you know that.

412
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,791
As usual, your immaturity
is leading you

413
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,958
to mistake isolation
for independence.

414
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,875
Anyway. If you truly
wish to be in a less

415
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:59,041
humiliating class, you're going
to have to work a lot harder.

416
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,375
I'm sorry you had to
witness all of that.

417
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,625
It's okay.

418
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,250
It was sort of a relief
to see you acting like

419
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,083
a normal girl and
not some kind of--

420
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,208
I didn't even say anything.

421
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm impressed by your skills.

422
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,541
It's just piano
and tea ceremony.

423
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,458
You said it was calligraphy.

424
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,708
Yeah, I do calligraphy, too.

425
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,041
How did you doctor your scores
on all of the entrance exams?

426
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,458
Tell the truth.

427
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:41,416
I told the truth. Coincidence.

428
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,791
I don't get you at all.
You're such a weirdo.

429
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,250
Huh, sure.

430
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,041
So, were you serious about
disbanding the study group?

431
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,625
Yes. It's a waste of my time.

432
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,666
If those losers wanna fail,
that's their prerogative.

433
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,750
It makes no difference to me.

434
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,291
Even though failing would
get them expelled?

435
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,750
I don't care what happens to
anyone but me, and their exit

436
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,833
would motivate the rest
of us to be better.

437
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,541
I don't see a downside
to any of that.

438
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,625
Without them, it will be easier
for our class to advance.

439
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,625
I don't think I could have
asked for a better solution.

440
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,250
That sounds like
flawed thinking.

441
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,000
Maybe you're just
lying to yourself.

442
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,291
[gasps]

443
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,000
[AYANOKOJI]
It's a shortcoming.

444
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,416
You make the assumption that
other people hold you back,

445
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,875
so you always keep them at
an arm's length as a rule.

446
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,541
Have you ever considered that
your isolationist philosophy

447
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,791
might be the very thing that
landed you in Class D

448
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,583
in the first place?

449
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,250
Ridiculous.

450
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,666
[inaudible]

451
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,083
[AYANOKOJI]
And so it went.

452
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,333
Everything looked hopeless.

453
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,708
[AYANOKOJI]
Nevertheless, the day arrived.

454
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,291
And all of us...

455
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,166
[pencils scraping]

456
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,125
[AYANOKOJI] ...we students
of Class One-D,

457
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,125
every last poor soul...

458
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:23,000
In grammar, math,
chemistry, civics, English,

00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,666
and every other
classroom subject...

460
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,375
[AYANOKOJI]
...we dodged the bullet

461
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,666
with higher scores than ever.

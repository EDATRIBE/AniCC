1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:18,708
[bell ringing]

2
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,833
[AYANOKOJI]
If I may,

3
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,625
I'd like to pose an
interesting question:

4
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,916
are all human
beings truly equal?

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,375
These days, everywhere you go,

6
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,541
there's talk about
the fight for equality.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,916
[AYANOKOJI]
As a wise man once said,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,583
"Heaven does not create one
person above or below another."

9
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,875
People like to throw
his words around.

10
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,833
But that's not the whole quote.

11
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,708
He goes on to say that,
while we are all equal at birth,

12
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,333
pretty soon, things
begin to change.

13
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,708
Academic effort is what
sets some people apart,

14
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,916
to rise above the others.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
At any rate, humans change over
time based on their actions.

16
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,916
Truth be told,
at the end of the day,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,666
"equality" is just a fantasy,
and most of us go through life

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,666
denying the fact that we live
in a meritocracy.

19
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,375
[KIKYO]
Um, excuse me, sir.

20
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,291
Would you be willing
to give up your seat?

21
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,000
[AYANOKOJI]
Mm?

22
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,791
[KIKYO] That is priority
seating, after all,

23
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,125
so it would only
be right for you

24
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,000
to let this older
woman sit there.

25
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,291
[KOENJI]
My, my, you're a pretty girl.

26
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,208
I understand that this is
priority seating, honey,

27
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,708
but there's no law forcing
me to give it up.

28
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,666
You think I should have to stand
up just because I'm still young?

29
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,458
Ha, ha. What a bunch
of ageist nonsense.

30
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,000
Sure, I'm younger than her,

31
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,958
but standing uses way more
energy than sitting.

32
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:45,958
Tell me. Why must I sacrifice
my health for this lady's sake?

33
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,791
Because, you'd be contributing
to the greater good of humanity.

34
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,333
And just take a look at her,

35
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,333
she's having trouble
staying upright.

36
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,416
I have zero interest
in contributing

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,583
to the greater good.
And anyway,

38
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,916
there are plenty of
other jerks on this bus

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,791
who could give
up their seats.

40
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,583
Furthermore, I don't
see much difference

41
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,708
between a priority seat
and a regular one.

42
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,125
So ask someone else
to be a hero.

43
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,625
To tell the truth, dear.

44
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,083
I don't mind standing,
don't worry.

45
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,083
But thank you, all the same.

46
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,291
Excuse me!

47
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,125
Would anyone on this bus
be willing to give up

48
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,708
their seat to this sweet lady?

49
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,458
Over here. I'll stand.

50
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,625
[KIKYO]
Thank you very much, ma'am!

51
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,291
[AYANOKOJI] Well, this is it.
My new school.

52
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,625
[AYANOKOJI] Tokyo Metropolitan
Advanced Nurturing High School.

53
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,625
Established by the government
to raise students

54
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,083
who have been deemed our
country's future leaders:

55
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,250
movers and shakers, if you will.

56
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,666
And it works, too.

57
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,000
It boasts 100% college entry
and employment rates.

58
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,666
Using experimental,
state-derived teaching methods,

59
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,375
they pull out all the stops to
build a bright future for Japan.

60
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,750
[SUZUNE]
Hey, you.

61
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,041
[SUZUNE] I noticed you staring
at me on the bus earlier.

62
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,750
Why was that?

63
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,875
Oh. I'm sorry.

64
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,375
I was just curious,

65
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,541
'cause well, you didn't want to
give up your seat, either.

66
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:42,041
I was wondering if, like me,
you'd rather stay out of it.

67
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,916
I'm nothing like you.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,125
In my case, I stayed silent
as a matter of principle.

69
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,375
[AYANOKOJI]
Uh-huh?

70
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,416
That makes her worse than me.

71
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,708
If that's all, goodbye.

72
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,625
[applause]

73
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,833
[AKANE]
And now, a few words

74
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,125
from our student
council president.

75
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,041
[MANABU]
Thank you for the introduction.

76
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:10,083
I'm Manabu Horikita. Newcomers,
as a representative

77
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,041
of the upperclassmen, and your
student council president,

78
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,166
I extend a warm welcome
to you all.

79
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,708
As I am sure you're aware,
our school is known for

80
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,208
its prestige and distinction
on all fronts,

81
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,833
and boasts impeccable employment
and college entry rates

82
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,208
across the board.
We take pride in this.

83
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,333
In fact, it's our school's
number one priority, and we all

84
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,500
work together to uphold this
standard of excellence.

85
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,208
Now you are a part of that, too.

86
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,291
We expect greatness
from all of you,

87
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,500
and we know you're capable...

88
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:41,083
[AYANOKOJI]
We're even in the same class?

89
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,875
[MANABU] ...so you alone
control your path.

90
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,083
Heh! Wow, me, too!
So, what's your favorite genre.

91
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,416
Romance, I bet!

92
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,000
[FEMALE STUDENT 1A]
Huh? Romance is my favorite!

93
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,708
How could you have known?

94
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,541
[FEMALE STUDENT 1A] Seriously!
<i>Shojo</i> manga is definitely mine.

95
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,916
[KIKYO] Uh... My favorite
genre is definitely Mystery.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,125
[FEMALE STUDENT 1B]
Mystery?

97
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,375
[KIKYO] It keeps me on
the edge of my seat!

98
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,833
[AYANOKOJI]
She has the seat next to me?

99
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,708
An annoying coincidence.

100
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,208
The feeling's mutual.

101
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,958
[HIRATA]
Hey, guys! Listen up for a sec.

102
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,416
We should go around the room
and introduce ourselves.

103
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,291
Start to get familiar
with each other.

104
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,500
I'd like to get to
know you guys.

105
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,166
Plus, the teacher isn't here
yet, so we might as well.

106
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,250
Does that sound okay?

107
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,333
I'm in!

108
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,916
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,333
I agree.

110
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,500
I mean, how else are we all
going to get acquainted.

111
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,875
I'm glad to hear it.

112
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:30,500
Well, I guess I'll go first,
then. I'm Yosuke Hirata.

113
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,125
But you can just call me
Yosuke, if you want.

114
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,208
I play every sport imaginable,

115
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,625
and I'm gonna try out for the
school's soccer team, for sure.

116
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,458
Thanks! Nice to meet you all.

117
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,833
[AYANOKOJI]
That was great.

118
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,916
I bet that guy's going to
be the leader in class.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,375
[KIKYO]
Okay, I guess I'll go next!

120
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,833
Hi, my name is Kikyo Kushida.

121
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,250
My goal is to become friends

122
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,750
with every person in
the entire school!

123
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,916
That obviously includes
everyone here.

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,500
So, if you're going out,
please consider inviting me!

125
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,500
[CLASS laughing, cheering]

126
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,708
[AYANOKOJI] She'll have no
trouble reaching that goal.

127
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:07,166
She's got that "everyone's
friend" vibe going on.

128
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,458
But I shouldn't be focused
on her at a time like this.

129
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,875
[CLASS laughs]

130
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,333
[AYANOKOJI] These introductions
are going to determine

131
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,875
everyone's standing in class.

132
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,166
Should I try to crack a joke?

133
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,750
[YAMAUCHI]
Then, in middle school...

134
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:22,416
[AYANOKOJI] I bet I could get a
laugh if I acted really hyper.

135
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,708
But I'd just end up
creeping people out.

136
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,958
Anyway, it's not like I
have any real interests

137
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,708
or hobbies to speak of.

138
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,375
I'm kinda like a free agent,
a blank slate.

139
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,041
[HIRATA]
Next up! How about you?

140
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,041
Uh. Who, me?

141
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,458
[HIRATA laughs]

142
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,666
[AYANOKOJI groans]
No getting out of this one.

143
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,000
I'd better muster up the energy
to stand up and say something,

144
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,708
for the sake of my reputation.

145
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,833
Uh... So, um...

146
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,083
I'm Kiyotaka Ayanokoji.

147
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,333
Uh... I can't wait
to study with you.

148
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:05,541
Uh. Uh... I'm not really good
at anything in particular.

149
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,791
Uh. I'll do my best to
get along with you all.

150
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,416
[AYANOKOJI]
I blew it.

151
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,583
Ayanokoji, well it's
nice to meet you.

152
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,208
I can't wait to be friends.

153
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,416
[SUZUNE]
Hmph.

154
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,708
[AYANOKOJI]
She just laughed at me.

155
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,708
[HIRATA]
Okay, who's next?

156
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,625
--[slam]
--[CLASS gasps]

157
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,541
Introductions are for
grade schoolers.

158
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,375
What are we, a buncha babies?

159
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,791
Get to know each other
on your own time.

160
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,625
[CHABASHIRA]
Let's get started.

161
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,750
Find your seats, everyone.

162
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:47,291
I'm Sae Chabashira, the homeroom
teacher for Class One-D.

163
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,875
At this school,
you will not change classes.

164
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,041
Ever. For the next three years,

165
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,833
I'll be responsible for
you until graduation.

166
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:58,083
For our first order of business:
the school rulebook.

167
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,416
Take one and pass them back.

168
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,333
[CHABASHIRA]
We have some rather unique rules

169
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,250
at this institution.

170
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,083
First, you must all
live in the dorms.

171
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,083
Your contact with the outside
world will be restricted,

172
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,083
as will your time away
from the campus.

173
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,875
For anyone concerned,

174
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,541
the school offers a wide
variety of facilities.

175
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,583
Anything you could need
or want can be found here.

176
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,333
Including leisure and
entertainment.

177
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,541
To make purchases,
you will spend your points,

178
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,375
which are tracked using the
school's main computer system.

179
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,083
At this school, you can
buy absolutely anything

180
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,125
on campus with these.

181
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,875
Points are distributed to you
on the first of each month.

182
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,791
Each point is worth one yen.

183
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,708
If you'll all check
your devices,

184
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,000
you'll notice that you've
already been allotted 100,000.

185
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,166
We what?!

186
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,666
Are you kidding me?

187
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,416
[gasps]

188
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,750
[CHABASHIRA]
I see you're all surprised

189
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,541
by the size of your allotment.

190
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:57,166
This school judges its students
based on their merit alone.

191
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,708
You've all shown immense value
just getting into this school.

192
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,666
We've allotted you what
we think you are worth.

193
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,833
[CLERK 1A]
Thank you very much, come again!

194
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,875
It really does work
exactly like money.

195
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,875
Twenty-five students per class,
and four classes per grade.

196
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,416
That makes 300 of us in all.

197
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,916
If each kid gets
100,000 a month,

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,416
that's 360 million per year.

199
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,833
How can the government afford
to pay for all this?

200
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,000
[AYANOKOJI]
Huh?

201
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,541
Another annoying
coincidence, it seems.

202
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,833
[AYANOKOJI]
You don't have to be so prickly.

203
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,125
Well, since we have to
sit by each other,

204
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,250
we should attempt to get along.

205
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,708
What's your name?

206
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,333
Really, you won't even
share with me that much?

207
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,750
[SUZUNE]
So? You got a problem with that?

208
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,375
No, but it would make things
weird for the next three years.

209
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,083
To sit next to ya and
never know your name.

210
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,000
It's Suzune Horikita.

211
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,708
"Horikita"?

212
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,958
Like the guy who spoke earlier?

213
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,916
[AYANOKOJI] Why are you
buying all cheap stuff?

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,500
You've got lots of money.

215
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,833
You could stand to
buy more expensive--

216
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,666
[SUZUNE]
I don't need all that.

217
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,208
--Yeah, but you could--
--[SUZUNE] I told you.

218
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,166
I don't need that stuff.

219
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,666
Right.

220
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,916
You're weird.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,166
You aren't very good at
interacting with people.

222
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,166
No conversation skills.

223
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,750
Yeah, I know.

224
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,166
But you don't seem to be
much better than I am.

225
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,416
That's true.

226
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,083
But I'm not the one who
said they were going to

227
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,958
"work hard to get along"
with everyone else.

228
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,458
These are free?

229
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,083
[AYANOKOJI] Maybe that's for
people who use up all their

230
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,666
points before the first
of the month, I guess.

231
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,041
How could one use up
a 100,000 points?

232
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,333
This school is too indulgent.

233
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,708
[KEN] You think you're
better than me? Huh?

234
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,625
Maybe. You are in
Class One-D, aren't you?

235
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,166
Yeah. What the hell does
it matter to you guys?!

236
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey, now that's no way
to talk to your elders.

237
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,750
You better learn some
respect, and fast.

238
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,125
[KEN]
Shut up!

239
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,458
[AYANOKOJI] Huh? Wait,
isn't that guy in our class?

240
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,541
[SUZUNE]
Maybe, but I won't get involved.

241
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,791
It's beneath my dignity.

242
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,625
Heh. We'll let it
slide this time.

243
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,583
Class D has already got it bad.

244
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,583
If we knocked you down a peg,
you'd fall right off.

245
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,166
Don't you run away from me!

246
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,083
[MALE STUDENT 1B]
Go ahead.

247
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,791
Scream your head
off if you want.

248
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,875
You people are already in
for a world of pain.

249
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,250
[AYANOKOJI]
"A world of pain"?

250
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,541
[KEN]
Those damn wimps!

251
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,666
[KEN growls]

252
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,458

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,750
[AYANOKOJI]
Not long after that,

255
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,875
the class began to split
up into cliques.

256
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,041
[FEMALE STUDENT 1A]
Hey, Kikyo.

257
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,875
You wanna eat lunch
together today?

258
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,291
I'm sorry. I can't.
I've got too much to do.

259
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,750
This beauty was a mere
80,000 points!

260
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,500
We get a 100,000 more
soon, so it was a steal!

261
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,416
Yeah, I've bought tons of games!
This is awesome!

262
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,625
I saw an adorable
pair of earrings!

263
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,458
Wanna stop by after class?

264
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,208
Let's shop for clothes, too!

265

[AYANOKOJI]
Unlike everyone else,

266
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,500
I failed to make any friends.

267
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,750
You're pathetic.

268
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,541
[AYANOKOJI]
Hm?

269
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,750
Yeah, well, you're alone, too.

270
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:24,666
That's true. But I, for one,
prefer to be alone.

271
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,250
[AYANOKOJI]
I'm gonna hit up the cafeteria.

272
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,541
[KIKYO] Um. Your name
is Ayanokoji, isn't it?

273
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,791
Yeah. And you're...

00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:39,750

00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,625
You remembered my
name, too! Thanks.

00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,125
Yeah. Guess I did.

278
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:50,541
So, um. Could we talk for a sec?

279
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,625
[KIKYO]
The reason I stopped you is that

280
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,000
you and Horikita
seem really close.

281
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,500
[AYANOKOJI]
Well... I wouldn't go that far.

282
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,083
[KIKYO]
Really?

283
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,666
But, you're the only person in
school that she talks to, ever.

284
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,416
It's my goal to become friends
with everyone at school,

285
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,958
even outside our class.

286
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,125
So I asked Horikita
for her phone number

287
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:19,166
to maybe call her sometime,
but she turned me down.

288
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,166
She said she doesn't wanna
be friends with anyone.

289
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,291
Yeah, I think that's
just how she is.

290
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,125
But I still want to be
friends with Horikita,

291
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,708
in spite of all that!

292
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,041
Do you think that you
could help me with her?

293
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,208
[AYANOKOJI]
Help you?

294
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,416
I don't know.

295
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,625
You mean... you won't?

296
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,500
[CHABASHIRA] The head
of the Yamato government

297
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,083
was known as the " <i>O-kimi</i> ."

298
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,791
He controlled the powerful
families of each region

299
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,708
using the <i>uji-kabane</i> system.

300
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,833
" <i>Uji</i> " referred to
groups of families

301
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,791
who shared the same bloodline,

302
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:53,625
while " <i>kabane</i> " referred to an
individual's post and status.

303
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,875
It was a system in which
pedigree determined one's place.

--That's all for today.

308
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,958
This school is
incredibly indulgent.

These kids play around
and sleep in class,

310
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,916
but the teachers never even
bother to do anything.

311
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,916
I can't believe the
government has the gall

312
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,750
to dub this an elite school.

313
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:28,125
Maybe they're just trying to
encourage individual autonomy.

314
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,625
Perhaps.

315
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,291
Hey. If you're just
gonna head home,

316
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,041
would you mind coming
somewhere with me first?

317
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,125
What are you trying to pull?

318
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,583
It's an invitation.

319
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,666
Why would that suggest
an ulterior motive?

320
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,000
If you'll be honest and
tell me what you really want,

321
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,041
maybe I'll be willing
to hear you out.

00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,750
You know that big café in

like to hang out?

there with me right now?

I'm just not brave enough
to go in there alone.

"no boys allowed" vibe.

else you can ask?

Well, no, I suppose there isn't.

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,000
[AYANOKOJI]
The impending confrontation

341
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,250
is tying my stomach into
knots. I feel sick.

342
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,666
[KIKYO]
Huh?! Horikita!

343
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,958
What a coincidence!
And Ayanokoji, too?

344
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,375
So, do you two come
here together often?

345
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,333
[AYANOKOJI]
No, this is our first time.

346
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,541
Oh, that's cool.

347
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,583
Well, I'm here by myself--

348
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,458
I'm leaving.

349
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,083
You are? We literally
just sat down.

350
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,666
But Kushida's here now.

351
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,833
So you don't need me
to stay, do you?

352
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,958
[AYANOKOJI] I guess not,
but Kushida and I

353
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,833
are just classmates,
we don't know each other.

354
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,666
And how is that any different
than what you and I are?

355
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,333
On top of that...

356
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,833
Something seems fishy
here, and I don't like it.

357
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,625
What? Oh, come on!

358
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,166
It's a coincidence.

359
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,166
[AYANOKOJI] Nice try,
but the correct response

360
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,708
would have been, "What's that
supposed to mean?"

361
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,041
[SUZUNE] The girls who
were at this table,

362
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,833
and the two at
the next one over,

363
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,250
is it coincidence they're
in our class?

364
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,625
Honestly.

365
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,375
Wow, I didn't even notice.

366
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,625
I'm impressed that you
recognized them.

367
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,958
You and I came straight here
immediately after class ended.

368
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,750
We came in, and then they left,
though they couldn't have

369
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,958
been here for longer than
a couple of minutes.

370
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,333
It doesn't make any sense.

371
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,541
Well, um...

372
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,125
Sorry. Yeah, you're right.
We set you up.

373
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,833
I thought so.

374
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,083
[KIKYO]
Horikita! Please be my friend.

375
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,000
That's all I wanted from this!

376
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,791
Well, what I want is
for you to leave me alone.

377
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,291
You two should both know that
you're wasting your time.

378
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,250
Huh? But I, I don't understand.

379
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,291
Won't you be lonely
all by yourself?

380
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:22,416
Being alone is not synonymous
with being lonely.

381
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,125
Like I said, it's a waste.

382
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,666
Every sound coming out of
your mouth repulses me.

383
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,333
Hey. Are you sure about this?

384
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,791
Do you really want
to spend the next

385
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,500
three years of your
life that way?

386
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,916
If you don't make friends,
you'll be isolated.

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,916
I've been completely alone
for the past nine years,

388
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,583
so what's another three to me?
It hardly matters.

389
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,791
Sorry. I kinda think I might
have made Horikita hate you,

390
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,666
and that was the last
thing I wanted.

391
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,166
[AYANOKOJI]
Nah, don't worry about it.

392
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,375
[KIKYO] Maybe she and I will
never be friends.

393
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,166
That makes me sad.

394
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,291
If I can't even make friends
with all my classmates,

395
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,708
my goal seems unattainable.

396
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,958
[AYANOKOJI] Personally, I think
Horikita's an exception.

397
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,166
Uh! That's Ichinose over there!

398
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,625
Honami Ichinose is
from Class One-B.

399
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,708
We became friends yesterday.

400
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,750
You're friends with kids
in other classes?

401
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,458
I can't even imagine that.

402
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:23,916
[KIKYO] Mm-hm. There are so many
really nice people in Class B.

403
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,125
You know. This school is pretty
amazing, don't you think?

404
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,458
All the different shops,

405
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,583
and the fact that we get a
100,000 yen every month!

406
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,000
[AYANOKOJI]
I don't know.

407
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,750
That amount seems kind of
excessive, in my opinion.

408
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,208
Yeah. I'm glad you
think so, too.

409
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,500
And, calling them points makes
them entirely too easy to spend.

410
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,500
To be honest,
it's skewing my money sense.

411
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,708
[AYANOKOJI]
Hm.

412
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,333
I'm going to have to budget
tightly to avoid overspending.

413
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,958
I mean, I'll buy the things
I need, obviously.

414
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:57,416
The toiletries I use every day,
like soap and toothpaste,

415
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,958
and I'll need panties.

416
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah. Horikita was saying
something similar.

417
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,791
[KIKYO]
Huh? Oh! So you even know

418
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,083
all about how she
spends her money.

419
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,583
You two really are
friends, aren't you?

420
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,833
No, I just happened to be there.

421
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,500
[AYANOKOJI]
Whoa. She's standing so close.

422
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,916
Well! We'll just have
to leave it at that!

423
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,375
[AYANOKOJI]
But it happens to be the truth.

424
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,416
One hundred thousand... Huh.

425
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,333
[AYANOKOJI]
Most students decided

426
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,416
to make the most of
their circumstances

427
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,625
without giving much thought
to anything at all.

428
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,833
Day in and day out they blew
through their monthly allowance

429
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,666
like it was nothing, buying
whatever they wanted.

430
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,458
The teacher never disciplined,

431
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,958
so conversations in class,
sleeping on desks, tardiness,

432
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,583
and downright truancy
became the norm.

433
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:09,958
Extravagance, debauchery,
and lethargy ran rampant.

434
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,916
Then, suddenly, on May first,
everything changed.

435
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,291
[SATO]
Huh? What's going on?

436
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,041
Hold on, yours hasn't, either?

437
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,666
What's the deal here?

438
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,083
--[CLASS chattering]
--[door slides]

439
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,750
[CHABASHIRA]
Take your seats, class.

440
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,291
Morning homeroom begins now.

441
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,458
[YAMAUCHI]
Hey, teacher?

442
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,125
Nobody here has gotten
any more points yet.

443
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,500
It's the first of the month.

444
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,916
Shouldn't they have already
been refilled by now?

445
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,541
[CHABASHIRA] Of course,
this month's allotment

446
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,625
has already been distributed.

447
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,458
Uh...

448
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,083
Mine aren't there.

449
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,833
[CHABASHIRA] As I said, the
points have been allocated.

450
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,750
I am certain about that.

451
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,500
And I know for a fact
that this class

452
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,791
has not been overlooked
by the administration.

453
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,625
What about our points?
Nobody in this class got any.

454
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,958
[CLASS chattering]

455
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,458
A whole class
comprised of morons.

456
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,083
You're all pathetic.

457
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,625
[gasps]

458
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,958
[CHABASHIRA] A combined total
of 98 tardies and absences,

459
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,666
391 documented cases
of cell-phone use,

460
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,000
and or talking during
instruction.

461
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,166
Impressive figures for the first
month of the school year.

462
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,333
At this school, your grades and
performance evaluations

463
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,750
aren't handed out.

464
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,375
They're reflected in your
monthly points allotment.

465
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:29,416
Your unconscionable behavior,
and that alone, has resulted

466
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,041
in the withholding of your
points allowance for this month.

467
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,208
The points allotted to
this class for the month

468
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,833
comes out to a total... of zero.

469
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,250
[BOTH gasp]

470
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,500
No way. I have to live on
no money this whole month?

471
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,541
Hang on. That's not fair.

472
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,875
It's just that...
You should have told us.

473
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,875
[CHABASHIRA] Did it never
occur to you to question

474
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,666
your circumstances?
You're only children.

475
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,583
Why would you be given
such an extravagant sum?

476
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,875
Didn't you think
there'd be a catch?

477
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,416
Your assumptions were wrong,

478
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,666
and now you must
all pay the price.

479
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,000
If you did have doubts,
why, then,

480
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,416
did you refuse to act upon them?

481
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,458
[CHABASHIRA] I told you on the
first day of class, didn't I?

482
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,916
I was perfectly clear.

483
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,416
This school judges its
students on merit alone, so.

484
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,291
As it stands now,
we think you're all garbage.

485
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,708
You're worth nothing,
so you get nothing.

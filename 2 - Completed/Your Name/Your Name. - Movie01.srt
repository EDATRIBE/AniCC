00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:04,541
[MITSUHA] Some mornings, I wake
up crying without knowing why.

00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,916
That sort of thing
happens now and again.

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,416
[TAKI] Whatever the dream was
I had, I can never remember it.

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
But...

00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:18,083
[MITSUHA] But the only thing
that does last when I wake up

00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:23,500
is a sense of loss which lingers
for a long time afterwards.

consumed by this feeling

ever since that day.

The day a star fell.

12
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,291
It was almost like...

13
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,625
[MITSUHA] ...like seeing
something out of a dream.

14
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,250
Nothing more or less...

It is in regards to

The election will be held
on the 20th of next month.

The election committee would
like to remind everyone that--

00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,875
A comet that comes only
once every 1,200 years

60
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,625
will finally be headed
our way in a month.

00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,541
[MITSUHA] And all the store
closes at nine o'clock.

179
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,625
[SAYAKA]
No bookstores, no dentists.

180
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,958
[MITSUHA] But two cocktail
lounges for whatever reason.

181
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,000
No jobs in town.

182
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,416
No one dateable.

183
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,666
[SAYAKA]
Even the days are too short!

184
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,166
[grumbles]

185
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,416
[TESHIGAWARA]
You know what?!

186
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,583
[SAYAKA, MITSUHA]
No, what?

187
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,833
Uh.

188
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,291
Forget that stuff.
Why don't we go to a café?

189
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,833
--[SAYAKA] A café?
--[MITSUHA] Really?

190
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,833
[SAYAKA, MITSUHA]
Where?

191
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,583
[GRANNY A]
Hello, kids.

192
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,208
--Evening, ma'm!
--Hi there!

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,375
How is this a café?

194
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,958
[TESHIGAWARA]
Like this town's got a café'.

195
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,500
Mitsuha just went
straight home.

196
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,083
Things have gotta be really
rough for her right now.

197
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,333
[TESHIGAWARA]
She's on center stage and all.

198
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,041
--[SAYAKA] Yeah.
--[DOG whines]

199
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,500
[TESHIGAWARA]
Hm?

200
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,333
Hey, Teshi.

201
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,750
[TESHIGAWARA]
Hm?

202
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,708
What're you gonna do after
you graduate high school?

203
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,750
Where'd that come from?
You talkin' about the future?

204
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,500
[SAYAKA]
Mh-hm.

205
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,625
I don't know.

206
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,000
I think I'll probably
just end up

207
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,375
livin' in this town, you know?

208
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,833
Same as ever.

209
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,791
[sighs]

210
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,833
I wanna do what you're doin'.

211
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,708
It's still too soon
for you to try, Yotsuha.

212
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,250
Listen to the thread's voice.

213
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,166
When you twine it round
and round like this,

214
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,541
feelings will start flowin'
between you and the thread.

215
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,500
It's not like threads talk.

216
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,833
[MITSUHA]
She's tellin' you to focus.

217
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,708
Etched within our braided cords

218
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,458
is a thousand years' worth
of Itomori's history.

219
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:56,416
Listen, somethin'
happened 200 years ago.

220
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,958
Here she goes.

221
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,208
[HITOHA] The bathroom of
sandal maker Mayugoro Yamazaki

222
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:05,208
caught on fire, and
this whole area burned down.

223
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,750
The shrine and old
documents were destroyed.

224
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,083
This is known as--

225
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,166
Mayugoro's Great Fire.

226
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,083
They named the fire after him?

227
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,250
I feel bad for Mayugoro.

228
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,000
The meanin' behind our festivals
was lost because of that.

229
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,625
Only the surface was left.

230
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,875
But even if those
words are gone,

231
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,958
the tradition shouldn't fade.

232
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:33,125
That's the Miyamizu Shrine's
duty, our important task.

233
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,708
[sighs]

234
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,500
Despite all that,
that son-in-law of mine--

235
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,583
Abandoning the Shinto priesthood

236
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,250
and leavin' this house were
bad enough, but politics?

237
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,291
Oh! He's hopeless.

238
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,250
[TOSHIKI]
Have another, Mr. Foreman.

239
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,791
[EMPLOYEE A] The site
we've got is a tricky one,

240
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,458
that's for sure.

241
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,125
I'll be counting on your
help again for this election.

242
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,708
[TESHIGAWARA'S DAD]
Leave it to me.

243
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,416
You'll get the votes from the
Kadoiri and Sakagami districts,

244
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,291
guaranteed.

245
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,375
How's the datin' scene?

246
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,416
It ain't easy, that's for sure!

247

[TESHIGAWARA'S DAD,
EMPLOYEES laughing]

248
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,416
Smells like corruption in there.

249
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,833
[TESHIGAWARA'S MOM]
What're you talkin' about?

250
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,750
We're gonna need two
or three more bottles

251
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,291
Yes, dear.

252
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,875
Katsuhiko, you're gonna help
out at the site this weekend.

253
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,500
We'll be usin' explosives,
so you better study up.

254

[groans]

255
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,416
What was that?

256
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,041
Got it!

257
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,458
[TESHIGAWARA] Guess we both
can't stand things here.

She's all grown up.

259

They're lookers all right,

260
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,083
just like their mother.

[TESHIGAWARA]
World's oldest kind of saké.

264
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,833
By chewin' on rice,
spittin' it out,

265
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,583
and then lettin' it ferment
naturally, it becomes alcohol.

266
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:51,125

really appreciate that?

--Yeah! Of course they do!

[MATSUMOTO] Hey, check
it out. It's Miyamizu.

271
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,875
Uh! I'd never do that!

00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,666

And in front of everybody.

273
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,791

Embarrasing, right?

274
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,875
[YOTSUHA]
You should try to cheer up, Sis.

275
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,833
Who cares if a few of the kids
from your school saw all that?

276
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,250
It must be nice for you,
not being a teenager.

277
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,625
[YOTSUHA] Hey, you should
just sell <i>kuchikamizake</i>

278
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,875
and move to Tokyo.

279
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,041
I bet you could sell it
with all sorts of stuff,

280
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,583
like photos and
making-of videos.

281

Oh!

282
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,500
And then you could call it
"Shrine Maiden Saké."

00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,750
You'll make butt-loads!

definitely scamming us.

00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,750
[MITSUHA]
Could this--? Could this mean--?

528
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,625
[TAKI]
No, no, no, no!

529
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:51,500
Could this mean...
that we're really--?

530
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,208
That we're...? In our dreams,
that guy and I...

531
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:57,041
That we're--? In our dreams,
that girl and I...

532
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,166
[MITSUHA, TAKI gasp]

533
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,208
[BOTH]
We're switching places?!

534
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,708
[MITSUHA] I'm slowly beginning
to get what's goin' on.

535
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,708
Taki's in high school
and living in Tokyo.

536
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,041
[TAKI]
Two or three times a week,

537
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,416
I'll suddenly and randomly
switch with Mitsuha,

538
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,416
who's somewhere
out in the boonies.

539
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,458
The trigger is sleep.
The cause is unknown.

540
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:52,416
[MITSUHA] Any memories
I have of the switch

541
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,250
get more and more hazy
after I wake up.

542
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,291
[TAKI] But there's no doubt
that we're switching places.

543
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,208
The reactions of everyone
around us prove it.

544
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,625
That's why--

545
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,791
[MITSUHA] That's why we decided
to lay out some rules

546
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,625
so we could protect each
other's way of life.

547
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:09,708
Things to watch out for
during the switches,

548
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,500
and a list of stuff
we should never do.

549
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:15,083
[TAKI] We also agreed to leave
each other reports on our phones

550
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,041
on the days we switch places.

551
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,375
[MITSUHA]
So that we can work together

552
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:22,041
to get through this weird
thing that's happening.

553
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:23,541
[MITSUHA]
And yet--

554
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,250
[TAKI]
And yet--

555
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,166
--I cannot believe this guy!
--I cannot believe this girl!

556
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:31,291
[groans]

557
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,958
[whines]

558
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,291
[SCHOOLBOYS gasp]

559
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,666
[MITSUHA]
Guys'll stare.

560
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,208
Watch the skirt!
These are basics for a girl!

561
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,166
[TAKI]
Stop wasting my money on sweets!

562
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,708
[MITSUHA]
It's goin' in your body!

563
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,208
Plus I also work for that money.

564
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,875
[TAKI]
Braiding cords is impossible!

565
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,958
[MITSUHA]
You work way too many shifts!

566
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,041
[TAKI]
'Cause you keep wasting money!

567
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,666
[MITSUHA] Had tea with Miss
Okudera on the way home.

568
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,458
You two have a good thing goin'.

569
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:29,083
[TAKI] Quit messing with
my relationships, Mitsuha!

570
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:32,666
[MITSUHA] Hey, Taki, why's a
girl confessin' her love to me?

571
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,250
[TAKI] Maybe you're just more
popular when I'm you.

572
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,958
[MITSUHA]
You're so full of yourself!

573
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,375
Like you have a girlfriend.

574
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:39,791
[TAKI] It's not like you
have anyone either!

575
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:40,666
[MITSUHA]
I don't...

576
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,958
[TAKI]
I don't...

577
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:44,333
[BOTH] ...because I don't
want a relationship!

578
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,708
[phone ringing]

579
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,708
I shouldn't for her sake.

580
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,833
[YOTSUHA] You sure do
like your own boobies.

581
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:17,000
Time to go! Get ready!

582
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,583
[HOST A] Over the course
of the last few days,

583
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,166
the Tiamat comet
has been visible.

584
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,875
But when and where
can people see it?

585
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:27,250
The Tiamat comet will be moving

586
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:28,791
in the same direction
the sun does,

587
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,000
from east to west from
our point of view.

588
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,375
So right after sunset.

589
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:33,333
As for where...

590
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:35,708
Why're you wearing your uniform?

591
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:37,041
[MITSUHA]
Huh?

592
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,291
[YOTSUHA]
Grandma?

593
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:49,250
Why does our shrine god's relic
have to be kept so far away?

594
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:52,708
[HITOHA] 'Cause of Mayugoro;
I don't really know.

595
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:54,083
Who's Mayugoro?

596
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,500
What? He's famous!

597
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,833
[MITSUHA]
Hop on, Grandma.

598
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:13,208
--[HITOHA] Oh!
--[YOTSUHA] Watch out! Careful!

599
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:27,958
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do
you know about Musubi?

600
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,583
Musubi?

601
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:33,333
It's what we used to call the
local guardian deity long ago,

602
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,958
and it means "union."

603
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:38,166
This word has profound meanin'.

604
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,208
Tyin' strings together
is a union.

605
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,666
Connectin' to people is a union.

606
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,833
And the flow of time is a union.

607
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:50,250
These are all part
of the god's power.

608
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:53,583
The braided cords that
we make are tied to that.

609
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,541
A skill from the god,

610
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:59,833
they represent the
flow of time itself.

611
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:02,833
They assemble and take shape.

612
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:06,833
They twist, tangle,
unravel now and then,

613
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:09,958
break and reconnect.

614
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:14,458
That's what a union is.
What time is.

615
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,250
[HITOHA]
Have a drink.

616
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,458
[MITSUHA]
Thanks.

617
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:21,916
I want some too!

618
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,958
[HITOHA]
That's also a union.

619
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,500
[HITOHA chuckles]

620
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:28,458
[HITOHA] Whether it's
water, rice, or saké,

621
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,875
when somethin' becomes
a part of a person,

622
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:34,166
it's a union, it
joins their soul.

623
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,583
Which is why the offerin'
we're making today

624
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,875
is such an important custom.

625
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:42,125
It connects the
god with people.

626
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:43,875
[YOTSUHA gasps]

627
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,875
Hey, I can see it!

628
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,458
This is where it is.

629
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:54,250
The sacred relic of
Miyamizu Shrine.

630
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:13,250
What lies ahead
is the hereafter.

631
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,166
[YOTSUHA]
Huh?

632
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,333
It's the netherworld.

633
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:17,666
[YOTSUHA giggles]

634
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,916
[YOTSUHA]
The netherworld!

635
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:24,625
In order to return
to this world,

636
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:28,958
you have to leave behind what
is most important to you.

637
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:29,875
[MITSUHA]
Huh?

638
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,083
[HITOHA chuckles]

639
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:34,250
Like the <i>kuchikamizake</i> .

640
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,125
[MITSUHA]
<i>Kuchikamizake</i> ?

641
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:40,083
[HITOHA] You'll offer it at the
foot of the shrine god's relic.

642
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:43,125
After all, it is half of you.

643
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,875
[MITSUHA]
Half... of Mitsuha.

644
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,791
[BOTH laugh]

645
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:07,500
Wow! It's already magic hour!

646
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,375
Hm? Magic hour?

647
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,541
[MITSUHA gasps]

648
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:20,791
[YOTSUHA]
Oh, yeah!

649
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,541
Maybe I can see the comet.

650
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,125
[MITSUHA]
Huh?

651
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,250
The comet?

652
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,583
Oh.

653
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:32,708
Mitsuha, you're dreaming
right now, aren't you?

654
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:46,791
I'm crying? But why?

655
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,208
[phone rings]

656
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:55,666
Miss Okudera?
She's almost where?

657
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,833
Uh!

658
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:59,333
Oh, Mitsuha, what did you do?

659
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,750
Date?!

660
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:12,250
[MITSUHA] Tomorrow's your
Tokyo date with Miss Okudera!

661
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,041
Meet up at the station at 10:30!

662
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:19,750
[MITSUHA] Well, that's what
I had planned, but--

663
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,541
Hi, Taki!

664
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:36,458
[OKUDERA giggles]

665
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:37,416
Wait long?

666
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,791
Yeah. Uh, no.

667
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,041
Uh...

668
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,708
[chuckles]

669
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:51,083
I just got here.

670
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:53,958
Thank goodness. Let's go.

671
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,500
[MITSUHA]
Must be nice.

672
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:00,083
They've probably
met up about now.

673
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,708
[MITSUHA]
Huh?

674
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:10,875
Why am I...?

675
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,541
Why?

676
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,250
[MITSUHA] It was a date
I wanted to go on,

677
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,916
but if it so happens
you end up goin',

678
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,291
you'd better be
grateful and enjoy it!

679
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:29,125
[OKUDERA] This is a nice.
It's my first time here.

680
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,875
So is this one of your
usual go-to spots, Taki?

681
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,125
[MITSUHA]
At any rate,

682
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,416
I bet you've never even
been on a single date.

683
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,416
It's too expensive!

684
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,416
[OKUDERA]
Uh.

685
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
[chuckles]

686
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,083
[TAKI]
I don't know what to say to her.

687
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,375
[MITSUHA] That's why I've
hand-picked some links below

688
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,750
to help you out,
you wall flower.

689
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,000
For real?

690
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,666
[TAKI]
Hm?

691
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,791
[TAKI]
Hm...

692
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,000
[TAKI growls]

693
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,666
She's making fun of me.

694
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:06,541
[gasps]

695
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,416
You know something, Taki?

696
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,833
Today you're... you're
like a different person.

697
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:41,833
[TAKI] Um, Miss Okudera,
you getting hungry?

698
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:43,916
We could get dinner.

699
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,333
[OKUDERA]
Uh. Let's call it a day.

700
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:49,958
All right.

701
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:53,458
I could be wrong,
and I'm sorry if I am.

702
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,041
About?

703
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:58,541
[OKUDERA] But you used to have a
little crush on me, am I right?

704
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,916
[TAKI]
Uh!

705
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,458
But right now, there's
someone else you like, huh?

706
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:03,541
[TAKI]
Wha--?

707
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:06,375
No. No, it's not that.

708
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:07,708
[OKUDERA]
Really?

709
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,083
There's no one.
It's not like that.

710
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:13,250
[OKUDERA]
Are you sure about that?

711
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:15,625
Well, thanks for today!

712
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,166
See you at work.

713
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:33,625
[TAKI]
By the time the date's over...

714
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,375
[TAKI, MITSUHA] ...you should
be able to see the comet

715
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,875
in the sky.

716
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,583
[TAKI]
What does she mean? Weirdo.

717
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,958
[phone ringing]

718
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:08,791
[phone ringing]

719
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:14,166
[MITSUHA]
Oh, it's you, Teshi.

720
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,416
No. I just didn't feel
like goin', that's all.

721
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,375
I'm fine.

722
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:24,083
What? The festival? Oh...

723
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,041
Oh, yeah, the comet.

724
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:29,458
It'll be at its brightest
today, right?

725
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:32,708
Okay, got it. See ya later.

726
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,958
[SAYAKA] You're just lookin'
forward to seein' Mitsuha

727
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:39,458
in a yukata, aren'tcha?

728
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:41,250
I-I am not!

729
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:43,208
I mean, it didn't
even cross my mind.

730
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:44,625
[SAYAKA]
Mm...

731
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:47,250
Y'know, she sounded kinda
down when I talked to her.

732
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,666
Maybe she just didn't
want a call from ya.

733
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,875
It's not funny!

734
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:51,916
[MITSUHA]
Sorry to keep ya.

735
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,458
--Oh, she's here!
--You're late.

736
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,791
[BOTH gasp]

737
00:42:56,041 --> 00:43:00,000
Mitsuha, what happened to--?

738
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,916
[TESHIGAWARA]
Your hair!

739
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,250
I guess... it's weird.

740
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,541
[TESHIGAWARA] You think it's
gotta do with some guy?

741
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:16,958
Like... he broke her heart?

742
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:20,333
Guys always just assume
that it has to do with a boy.

743
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:22,416
She said she felt
like cuttin' it.

744
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,958
[TESHIGAWARA]
Ya sure about that?

745
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,500
You really think she felt like
cuttin' off that much of it?

746
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:27,375
[BOTH]
Huh?

747
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:29,750
Hey, guys! I can see it!

748
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,041
[TESHIGAWARA]
Whoa.

749
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:56,458
[MITSUHA]
Huh?

750
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,458
[VOICE MESSAGE A] The number
you are trying to reach

751
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:11,708
is currently outside
the cellular network

752
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,750
or has been turned off due--

753
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,500
[TAKI] I'll just have to tell
her how lousy the date ended up

754
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:21,208
the next time we switch.

755
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,500
That's what I thought.

756
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:24,708
But--

757
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:27,625
For some reason, the
switches Mitsuha and I'd

758
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:32,666
been going through until now...
they never happened again.

759
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,458
[TAKI]
Wha--?

760
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:29,750
What're--?
What're you doing here?

761
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:32,583
[OKUDERA giggles]

762
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:35,625
[OKUDERA]
Tsukasa told me, so here I am.

763
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,791
[CONDUCTER A] We thank you for
riding the Shinkansen line...

764
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,708
[TAKI]
I asked for two things.

765
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:43,750
To cover my shift, and to back
up my alibi if my dad asked.

766
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,791
Relax, Takagi's gonna
take your shift.

767
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,291
Gotcha covered!

768
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:49,333
But you owe me dinner!

769
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:50,791
So you're all in on it.

770
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,416
You've got everyone
worried about you.

771
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,458
Huh?

772
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:54,791
We can't ignore this.

773
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:56,541
What if somebody's trying
to pull one over on you?

774
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:58,041
Like catfish?

775
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,125
[OKUDERA] I mean you met this
person online, didn't you?

776
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,708
No, not exactly!
It's kinda complicated.

777
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:03,750
Could be from a dating site.

778
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:05,458
She's not!

779
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:07,958
It's because you've been
acting awfully fishy lately.

780
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,458
So we're keeping
an eye on you.

781
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:11,916
I don't need a
baby sitter, okay?

782
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,666
[TAKI]
The switches stopped.

783
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,000
My calls never connected and
texts never went through.

784
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:23,541
That's why I decided to
go see Mitsuha in person.

785
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,541
I wanted to see her.

786
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:26,708
But--

787
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,208
[OKUDERA]
What?

788
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,250
You don't know where
she is exactly?

789
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,791
The town's landscape
is your only clue?

790
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,208
Yeah.

791
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,583
[OKUDERA]
And you can't contact her?

792
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,541
What's that about?

793
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,791
[TSUKASA] Where are we?
You're a terrible tour guide.

794
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,416
[TAKI]
'Cause I'm not one!

795
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,708
Oh, well.

796
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:48,500
Guess we'll help you search.

797
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:50,791
Ah! It's so cute! Look, Taki!

798
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:51,708
[TAKI grumbles]

799
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:53,125
Seriously, guys?

800
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:55,625
[OKUDERA]
It moved! Aw!

801
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,333
[TAKI]
This is a lost cause.

802
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:26,666
[OKUDERA, TSUKASA]
What?

803
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,583
After everything that
we've done for you today?

804
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:29,291
[TSUKASA]
Um-hm.

805
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:31,875
[TAKI sighs]

806
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:34,500
You haven't done anything.

807
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,250
[OKUDERA]
One Takayama ramen.

808
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,791
[TSUKASA]
One Takayama ramen.

809
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,333
[TAKI]
I guess I'll have the same.

810
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:45,166
Sure. Three orders of ramen.

811
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,416
[HUSBAND A]
Got it.

812
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:49,958
Think we can make it
back to Tokyo tonight?

813
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:52,291
Well, I think we'll
be cuttin' it close,

814
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:53,416
Let me take a look.

815
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,291
'K, thanks.

816
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:57,083
Wait, Taki, you sure about that?

817
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,208
[TAKI]
Yeah.

818
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:02,250
I kinda feel like maybe I've
been barking up the wrong tree

819
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:03,958
this whole time.

820
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:11,208
Hey. That's a sketch
of Itomori, isn't it?

821
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,541
[WIFE A]
It's drawn really well.

822
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,750
Come take a look at this, hun!

823
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:20,916
Yeah, that's Itomori.
It takes me back.

824
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,666
My husband was born and
raised there, you know.

825
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,583
Itomori?

826
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:29,625
Yes, of course!
That's the place!

827
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,625
It's nearby, right?

828
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:33,041
You don't...

829
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:34,875
Itomori was--

830
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:36,875
Itomori?

831
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:38,041
--Wait!
--But that's where--

832
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:41,000
Isn't that the area
where that comet--?

833
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:42,333
[TAKI]
Huh?

834
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:33,250
[OKUDERA] Hey, is this place
really where she's from?

835
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,666
No way.

836
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,083
Taki must've just confused
this with somewhere else.

837
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,083
No, I didn't.

838
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:41,083
This was the place.

839
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,541
This schoolyard.
These mountains.

840
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,083
Even this high school here!

841
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,625
I remember it all!

842
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:48,583
There's no way you could.

843
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:52,541
You've gotta know about that
disaster three years ago, right?

844
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,375
Hundreds of people died.

845
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:56,875
They died?

846
00:50:56,958 --> 00:50:59,000
Three years ago?

847
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,625
It can't be.

848
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,750
There's no way.

849
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:07,708
I mean, I still have
the memos she wrote.

[TAKI]
They're fading...

853
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:41,416
[TSUKASA] Comet Tiamat, with an
orbital period of 1,200 years,

854
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,458
made a close approach to Earth
three years ago in October.

855
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:47,875
Nobody foresaw that
its nucleus would split

856
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,666
at its perigee.

857
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,208
[TAKI] The fragment that broke
off of it became a meteor

858
00:51:58,291 --> 00:51:59,958
and struck Japan.

859
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,708
[OKUDERA] It looks like
that day was the same date

860
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:06,041
as the autumn festival.

861
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:08,833
[TSUKASA]
The point of impact was here.

862
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:11,041
At 8:42 p.m.,
it fell right around

863
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:13,625
where people were gathered
for the festival.

864
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:20,166
[TSUKASA]
Over 500 died.

865
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,666
It was a third of the
town's population,

866
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,583
and now nobody lives
in Itomori anymore.

867
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:34,083
[TAKI gasps]

868
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:37,583

Huh? That's her?

871
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:45,791
You were wrong. You gotta be.

872
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:49,541
After all, this girl here
died three years ago!

873
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,458
[TAKI]
Just two or three weeks ago

874
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:54,750
she said that I'd be
able to see the comet.

875
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,500
That means--!

876
00:52:56,583 --> 00:53:00,958
[HITOHA] You're dreaming
right now, aren't you?

877
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:03,916
[TAKI]
I...

878
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:07,916
[TAKI]
What... was I?

879
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:20,958
[clapping, distant cheering]

880
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:22,875
Sounds lively over there.

881
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:25,833
[TSUKASA] They only have one
room left. I'm really sorry.

882
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:28,250
It's not a problem.

883
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,375
How's Taki?

884
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:32,041
He's still reading
articles on Itomori.

885
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,125
He's going through all those
newspapers and magazines

886
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:36,333
at random. Seems obsessive.

887
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,166
What is it?

888
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,583
Oh, sorry. You smoke, huh?

889
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:48,875
Yeah. I did quit at one point.

890
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:52,041
[TSUKASA] What do you think
about what Taki's been saying?

891
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,458
I had feelings
for him, you know.

892
00:53:57,541 --> 00:53:59,666
The way he's been recently.

893
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:04,250
I mean, he was a nice guy
before, but he's even nicer now.

894
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:08,666
Kind of... frantic. It was cute.

895
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,625
Although I do think what
he's been telling us

896
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:15,166
is definitely strange sounding.

897
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,041
But in the end, the fact remains
that Taki's met someone,

898
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:21,750
and that someone is
the reason he changed.

899
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:23,916
That much is for sure.

900
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,083
[TAKI]
It was all just a dream.

901
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,375
[TAKI]
I recognized the landscape

902
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:46,208
because I unconsciously
remembered the news

903
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:49,750
from three years ago.

904
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:53,166
If it's not that,
is she... a ghost?

905
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:56,541
Or... did I just make it up?

906
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,291
The whole thing.

907
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:59,500
[gasps]

908
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:05,250
What was her name?
I can't remember.

909
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:06,750
[knocking]

910
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,583
Tsukasa said he was gonna
go ahead and take a bath.

911
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:12,250
Miss Okudera.

912
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:14,875
Uh... I, um--

913
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:18,375
I realize I've been saying
a lot of strange things.

914
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:21,208
I'm really sorry, and thank you.

915
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:30,708
[OKUDERA]
Braided cords.

916
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:32,416
Pretty.

917
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,583
That band on your wrist,
that's one, isn't it?

918
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,458
[TAKI]
Huh?

919
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:39,041
Oh, this thing? Guess so.

920
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:42,791
Somebody...
Someone gave it to me.

921
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:46,250
I wear it sometimes as
kind of a lucky charm.

922
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,416
Who was it?

923
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:55,208
It's late. Why don't you go
down and take a bath too?

924
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:56,250
Sure.

925
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:57,541
Wait.

926
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:02,958
Yeah, someone who makes these.

927
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,958
They once told me something.

928
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:07,958
The cords represent
the flow of time.

929
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:11,500
They twist and tangle,
unravel and connect.

930
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:14,583
And how that's what time is.

931
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,166
[gasps]

932
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,958
Maybe if I could--

933
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,583
[MITSUHA]
Taki.

934
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:47,583
Taki.

935
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,166
Taki!

936
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:52,500
[MITSUHA]
Don't you remember?

937
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:14,958
[OKUDERA sighs]

938
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,541
[OKUDERA]
Taki.

939
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,625
[HUSBAND A]
Eat this bento up there.

940
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:43,875
[TAKI]
Huh?

941
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:48,166
Your drawin' of Itomori,
you did a real good job.

942
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:00,083
[thunder rumbles]

943
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,708
[TAKI]
They assemble and take shape.

944
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:31,166
They twist, tangle,
unravel now and then,

945
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:34,458
break and reconnect.

946
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:38,250
That's what a union is.
What time is.

947
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:51,375
[TAKI]
There it is.

948
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:55,791
[TAKI]
It's really there.

949
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:58,541
It wasn't a dream.

950
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:33,166
[TAKI] What lies ahead...
is the netherworld.

951
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:58,583
[TAKI]
It's still here.

952
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:03,250
This was Yotsuha's,
and this was mine.

953
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,583
This was before the comet.

954
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:10,125
So when I switched
places with her,

955
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:14,083
it was also three
years in the past.

956
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:18,583
Our times got tangled somehow.

957
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:21,208
This is half of her.

958
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:38,000
[TAKI]
Musubi.

959
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:41,875
If it's true, and time
can be unraveled,

960
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:44,375
just give me one chance.

961
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:56,333
[gasps]

962
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,500
[TAKI]
A comet!

963
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:05,000
[BABY crying]

964
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:08,625
Your name's going to be Mitsuha.

965
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:17,041
[TOSHIKI]
Both of you are my treasures.

966
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,875
You're going to
be a big sister.

967
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,916
[FUTABA]
I'm so sorry, me dears.

968
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:30,666
[YOTSUHA] Dad, when is
Mommy coming home?

969
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,250
[TOSHIKI]
I couldn't help her.

970
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,916
[HITOHA]
Get a hold of yourself!

971
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,541
[TOSHIKI]
Who cares about the shrine?!

972
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:37,250
[HITOHA]
But you're in charge now!

973
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,625
[TOSHIKI] I loved Futaba!
Not Miyamizu Shrine.

974
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:41,208
[HITOHA]
Get out!

975
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:47,958
[HITOHA] Now listen to me,
girls, starting today,

976
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:50,333
you'll be living with Grandma.

977
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,625
[MITSUHA]
Who am I? Who are you?

978
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,125
Don't be full of yourself!

979
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,291
Like you have a girlfriend.

980
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,666
Must be nice.

981
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,208
They've probably
met up about now.

982
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:06,333
[gasps]

983
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:07,708
Why am I...?

984
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:08,708
I'm going to Tokyo.

985
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:11,208
[YOTSUHA]
What? Wait, Sis!

986
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,958
[MITSUHA] Grandma, would you
mind doin' me a favor?

987
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:21,000
Oh, yeah, the comet.

988
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,916
It'll be at its
brightest today, right?

989
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,083
[TAKI]
Mitsuha! Don't go there!

990
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:28,541
Mitsuha.

991
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:31,791
You've gotta get out of town
before the comet strikes!

992
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,500
[TAKI]
Mitsuha, run!

993
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:37,666
Mitsuha!

994
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,208
Mitsuha!

995
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:42,041
Mitsuha!

[gasps]

997
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:02,958
[MITSUHA]
Mitsuha. She's alive.

998
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,375
Let me guess, you're
touchin' your boo--

1001

Her sister!

1002
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:24,166
Yotsuha!

[MITSUHA crying]

1004
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:30,041
[YOTSUHA]
I think she's finally lost it.

1005
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:33,250
Just for today,
I'm gonna head out first.

1006
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:38,458
She's lost it. Really lost it.
Totally, totally lost it.

1007
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,250
[WEATHER WOMAN A] For all you
star-gazers out there,

1008
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,875
the comet Tiamat has been
visible to the naked eye

1009
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:44,416
for about a week now.

1010
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:48,125
Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 p.m.

1011
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:49,666
and be at its maximum brightness

1012
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:50,625
when viewed from
the Earth's surface.

1013
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:51,666
[MITSUHA]
It's tonight.

1014
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,166
There's still time left.

1015
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:56,208
Mornin', Mitsuha.

1016
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:58,166
What's this?

1017
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:01,333
Hold on. You're not
Mitsuha, are you?

1018
01:05:01,416 --> 01:05:04,041
[gasps]
Wait, how did you...?

1019
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:06,041
You already knew?

1020
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:09,583
No, but watchin' the way
you've been behaving lately

1021
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:12,250
stirred some memories up.

1022
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,750
[HITOHA]
When I was a young girl,

1023
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:18,833
I had some pretty
strange dreams myself.

1024
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:19,833
[MITSUHA]
Huh?

1025
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,083
[HITOHA]
Though it's been so long,

1026
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:23,375
the memories of who I
became in those dreams

1027
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:26,541
have pretty much
faded at this point.

1028
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:27,833
[MITSUHA]
Faded.

1029
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:29,666
Treasure the experience.

1030
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:33,083
Dreams eventually
will fade away.

1031
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,875
i went through similar
times myself,

1032
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:38,958
and so did your mother.

1033
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:40,291
[MITSUHA]
What if...

1034
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:43,333
...all those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had...

1035
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:45,625
...it had to do with today?

1036
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:49,125
Grandma, you have
to listen to me!

1037
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:52,875
Tonight, the comet is
going to fall on Itomori.

1038
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,041
You're all gonna die!

1039
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:55,625
Huh?

1040
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,208
[MITSUHA]
"Nobody's gonna believe that"?

1041
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:06,208
I didn't expect that
out of Mitsuha's grandma.

1042
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:07,375
It doesn't matter!

1043
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:10,666
There's no way I'm gonna
let them all die!

1044
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,041
[SAYAKA]
Mitshua!

1045
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:13,708
What happened to--?

1046
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:15,041
[TESHIGAWARA gasps]

1047
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:17,375
What'd you--? You're hair!

1048
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:20,000
Ah, the haircut?
Looked better before, huh?

1049
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,833
[TESHIGAWARA]
No! I-It's good!

1050
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:23,250
Nevermind that!

1051
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:25,666
If we don't do something
about tonight, we'll all die!

1052
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,458
[SAYAKA]
What?

1053
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:28,625
[SAYAKA, TESHIGAWARA]
Uh...

1054
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:30,958
[MITSUHA]
It's up to us to save everyone!

1055
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,291
Wait! Shouldn't you
be in school?

1056
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:42,000
Well, we sort of have to save
the town, or something.

1057
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:43,666
Huh?

1058
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,000
[MITSUHA]
The warning system?

1059
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,166
[TESHIGAWARA] Yeah, those
speakers all over town.

1060
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,250
[MITSUHA]
I get it. It could work!

1061
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:55,875
Nice job, Teshi!

1062
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:58,375
Hey, I don't think you should
be sittin' so close to me.

1063
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:00,791
What's wrong? Uh-oh! You shy?

1064
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:04,041
Would ya quit it? It ain't
proper! And you know it!

1065
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:05,583
[MITSUHA]
Huh?

1066
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:07,666
[MITSUHA laughs]

1067
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,208
[MITSUHA]
Such a gentleman!

1068
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:12,000
Ha! Since when?

1069
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:13,791
[SAYAKA]
I bought all the snacks, guys!

1070
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:14,625
Here's the change.

1071
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,333
Sorry for the trouble.

1072
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:17,458
[SAYAKA]
I didn't mind.

1073
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:18,708
We oughta be gettin' paid.

1074
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:21,375
Quit complaining.

1075
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:25,625
So? What'd ya come up with?
Got an evacuation plan?

1076
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
[BOTH chuckle]

1077
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:31,958
[SAYAKA]
A... A-- A bomb?!

1078
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:33,958
Yeah, we have
water gel explosives

1079
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:36,250
we use for construction
at our storage site.

1080
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:39,250
And the warning system?

1081
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:41,000
A startup frequency can hijack

1082
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:43,041
the town's warning
system pretty easily.

1083
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,041
So we can broadcast
an evacuation warning

1084
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:47,208
for the whole town
right from school!

1085
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:49,583
Look, we're outside
the disaster area here,

1086
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:50,833
so we'll just make
an announcement

1087
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:52,375
to evactuate to the school.

1088
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:53,666
[SAYAKA]
It's--

1089
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,208
It's totally a crime.

1090
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:56,791
[MITSUHA] You'll be in charge
of the broadcast, Saya.

1091
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:57,708
[SAYAKA]
Why me?!

1092
01:07:57,791 --> 01:07:59,333
You're in the broadcast club.

1093
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:01,291
And I'll be in charge
of the explosives.

1094
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,000
While I go have a
word with the mayor.

1095
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,500
[SAYAKA]
Why?

1096
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:06,500
'Cause if the evacuation order's
not comin' from town hall,

1097
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,000
then nobody's gonna go anywhere.

1098
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:09,875
But if I talk to the mayor,
as his daughter,

1099
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,333
I can convince him.

1100
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:12,791
[TESHIGAWARA]
It's the perfect plan.

1101
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:14,375
[sighs]

1102
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:17,166
Fine, I don't really care
one way or the other.

1103
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:19,500
This is just a theory
of yours, right?

1104
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,416
[MITSUHA]
Uh.

1105
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,625
Well...

1106
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:23,333
Theories can be
based on reality!

1107
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:26,208
Like, do you know the story
of how Itomori Lake was formed?

1108
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:27,458
It's a crater!

1109
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:29,958
That means a meteor hit
this area at least once

1110
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:31,708
a thousand years ago!

1111
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:32,666
[MITSUHA]
Right!

1112
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:33,916
That's why--

1113
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,833
Nice one, Teshi!

1114
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,875
[BOTH]
Let's go evacuate the town!

1115
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:48,166
[TOSHIKI] What on earth
are you talking about?

1116
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:51,166
[MITSUHA]
Like I said,

1117
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,500
we have to evacuate everyone in
town before tonight or else--

1118
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,541
Enough. Shut up!

1119
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:58,500
[sighs]

1120
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,333
"The comet is going to split
in two and strike the town"?

1121
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:07,083
"Over 500 will die"?

1122
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:10,958
How dare you stand there
and spout such nonsense!

1123
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:13,916
If you're serious,
you must be sick.

1124
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,708
I guess wrecklessness
is a Miyamizu trait.

1125
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:20,750
I'll have a car take you
to the city hospital

1126
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:22,333
for an examination.

1127
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:26,083
We will continue this discussion
after you've seen a doctor.

1128
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:29,208
You!

1129
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,166
You son of a--

1130
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:41,916
Mitsuha.

1131
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:44,833
No.

1132
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:47,375
Wait a minute...

1133
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,125
Who are you?

1134
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,500
I'll see you guys
at the festival.

1135
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:07,958
We'll meet you at the steps to
the shrine! Don't be late, okay?

1136
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,166
--Bye-bye!
--See ya.

1137
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,500
Later.

1138
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,541
You shouldn't go!

1139
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:16,125
You've gotta leave town!
Tell all of your friends!

1140
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:17,708
What's wrong with ya?

1141
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:18,666
[YOTSUHA]
Mitsuha!

1142
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,500
What was that about?

1143
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:21,208
Come on. Let's go.

1144
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:23,875
What're you doing, huh?

1145
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,875
If it was Mitsuha,

1146
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:28,083
would she have been
able to convince him?

1147
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:29,208
Is all this my fault?

1148
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,041
[YOTSUHA]
Huh?

1149
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,583
[MITSUHA]
Yotsuha!

1150
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:33,666
Promise me that you'll leave
town with Grandma before dark!

1151
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:34,666
What?

1152
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,166
You're gonna die
if you stay here!

1153
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,583
What're you talking about?

1154
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,041
And why'd you suddenly
go to Tokyo yesterday?

1155
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:42,500
You've been acting
really strange lately!

1156
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:44,208
[MITSUHA]
Huh?

1157
01:10:44,291 --> 01:10:45,625
Went to Tokyo?

1158
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,500
[SAYAKA]
Hey! Mitsuha!

1159
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:52,583
[TESHIGAWARA]
How'd it go with your old man?

1160
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:54,666
[TESHIGAWARA]
Huh?

1161
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,083
Hey! Mitsuha!

1162
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:58,791
What's with your sister?

1163
01:10:58,875 --> 01:10:59,875
[YOTSUHA]
Dunno.

1164
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:01,125
[MITSUHA gasps]

1165
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:02,333
[YOTSUHA]
Huh?

1166
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:12,500
Could she be over there?

1167
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:15,041
What's that? What's over there?

1168
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:16,625
[MITSUHA]
Let me use your bike, Teshi.

1169
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:17,958
Hey!

1170
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:20,250
Mitsuha!

1171
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:21,958
And what do we do?

1172
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:24,083
Get things ready
like we planned!

1173
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,083
I'm counting on you!

1174
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:52,333
[gasps]

1175
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:54,833
[TAKI]
Oh my gosh! I'm Taki again.

1176
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:00,333
But what was Taki
doin' out here?

1177
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,291
[TAKI gasps]

1178
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:13,500
The town. It's gone.

1179
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:26,250
[TAKI]
So does that mean...

1180
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,416
[TAKI]
...they died?

1181
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,625
[MITSUHA]
Taki.

1182
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:44,041
Taki.

1183
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:47,750
[MITSUHA]
Don't you remember?

1184
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,416
[MITSUHA] I'm going to
Tokyo for a few hours.

1185
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,208
What? Right now?

1186
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:05,500
But why?

1187
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,041
For a date.

1188
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:08,833
[YOTSUHA]
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

1189
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:12,416
I didn't say it
was a date for me.

1190
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,166
I'll be back tonight.

1191
01:13:17,416 --> 01:13:20,916
[MITSUHA] If I suddenly show up,
will it be a nuisance?

1192
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,875
Or a surprise?

1193
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:25,333
He might not like it if I do.

1194
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,416
[VOICE MESSAGE A] The number
you are trying to reach

1195
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,208
is currently outside
the cellular network.

1196
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:39,541
[MITSUHA]
I guess it won't happen.

1197
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,458
But what if it did?

1198
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:44,416
What would I do?

1199
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,458
Would I annoy him?

1200
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:48,541
Would it be awkward?

1201
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:53,041

glad to see me.

01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:04,541
[TESHIGAWARA]
Get outta here! Run!

1389
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:07,500
[MITSUHA] It's not safe here!
Please evacuate!

1390
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:10,000
It's not workin'.
We're runnin' outta time!

1391
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:12,375
Mitsuha!

1392
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:14,416
What's wrong?

1393
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,416
What is it?

1394
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,458
I can't remember what
his name is anymore!

1395
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,583
What is with you?!

1396
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:25,083
You're the one who
started all of this!

1397
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:28,458
We can't evacuate everyone
without firefighters!

1398
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:32,791
Get goin'! You gotta
convince your old man!

1399
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:36,416
[SAYAKA]
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1400
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,125
Reports of an explosion at
the substation are coming in.

1401
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:42,666
[TESHIGAWARA] Everybody!
Get to the high school! Hurry!

1402
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Oh, it's Mitsuha.

1403
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:51,708
[CHIEF] Why would terrorists
attack way out here?

1404
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:52,958
What is Chubu Electric sayin'?

1405
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,541
[CLERK]
They're still checking.

1406
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:57,041
Any update? No wildfires yet?

1407
01:26:57,125 --> 01:27:00,333
You're sure? Got it.

1408
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:02,583
Make them stop this
broadcast immediately!

1409
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:04,458
Haven't you located
its source yet?!

1410
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:08,333
Mayor! The Takayama
sensor station just called!

1411
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:10,041
From the high school?

1412
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:13,291
[SAYAKA] Once again, residents
in the following areas,

1413
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:16,083
please evacuate
to Itomori High-- Ah!

1414
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:18,583
[MR. ENDO] What're you
doing? Turn that off!

1415
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:22,208
They got Saya!

1416
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:24,000
[TESHIGAWARA]
Oh, no!

1417
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:26,750
[crying]

1418
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:30,166
What were you doin',
Natori? I swear.

1419
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:33,125
[ringing]

1420
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:36,625
[AIDE D]
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1421
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:41,416
We are currently confirming
the reports of the accident.

1422
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,041
We instruct all residents
to remain calm

1423
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:46,333
and stay where they are
till further notice.

1424
01:27:46,416 --> 01:27:48,291
I guess we have to stay put.

1425
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:49,333
[FIREFIGHTER A]
What is goin' on?

1426
01:27:49,416 --> 01:27:51,333
[FIREFIGHTER B]
So stay on standby.

1427
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:54,083
[TESHIGAWARA] Come on, they said
everyone should evacuate!

1428
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:56,250
The high school's
the evacuation center!

1429
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:57,583
[TESHIGAWARA'S DAD]
Katsuhiko!

1430
01:27:57,666 --> 01:27:58,916
[TESHIGAWARA]
Huh?

1431
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:03,833
Tell me. What do you
think you're doing?

1432
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:09,375
Sorry, Mitsuha.

1433
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:11,666
This is the end.

1434
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,958
[gasps]

1435
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:14,375
Oh my god.

1436
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:16,958
It's actually splittin' apart.

1437
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:24,750
[REPORTER A]
Look at that!

1438
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:26,791
The comet has split
into two large parts,

1439
01:28:26,875 --> 01:28:30,000
and meteors are now
falling to earth!

1440
01:28:30,083 --> 01:28:31,958
I don't believe anyone
could've predicted this.

1441
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:34,333
Either way, we have quite
the mystical view here.

1442
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:36,416
[NEWSCASTER B] So what does
the comet's nucleus splitting

1443
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,750
mean for us?

1444
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:39,500
[EXPERT B] The comet's not
within the Roche limit,

1445
01:28:39,583 --> 01:28:42,458
so the nucleus itself must've
had a structural weakness

1446
01:28:42,541 --> 01:28:43,666
for this to happen.

1447
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:46,125
[EXPERT A] Comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke apart

1448
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:48,916
and collided with
Jupiter in 1994.

1449
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,083
There were at least
21 fragments then.

1450
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:51,666
I'm going outside
to take a look.

1451
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:52,916
[EXPERT B] The fragments
will likely burn up

1452
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,541
well before reaching the ground

1453
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:56,083
The probability of a
meteor actually landing...

1454
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:57,125
[REPORTER C]
Scientists were already

1455
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,583
intently examining the comet,

1456
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,583
but never foresaw
this development.

1457
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:02,041
[EXPERT C]
To predict the trajectory--

1458
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:04,625
[EXPERT E] As we stand here
witnessing this spectacle,

1459
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:07,458
unassisted and
with our bare eyes,

1460
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:09,375
it strikes me that
living in such an age

1461
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:12,291
has never felt more
fortunate than now.

1462
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:19,708
[MITSUHA]
Hey. Who are you?

1463
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:24,416
[MITSUHA]
Who?

1464
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,208
Who?

1465
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:28,125
Who is he?

1466
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:29,875
Someone precious.

1467
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:31,916
Someone I shouldn't forget.

1468
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,583
Someone I didn't want to!

1469
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:36,291
Who?

1470
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:37,416
Who?

1471
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,250
Who are you?

1472
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:41,250
What's your name?

1473
01:29:46,958 --> 01:29:48,458
Oh, no.

1474
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:50,208
[MITSUHA yelps]

1475
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:10,291
[TAKI] So that we don't forget
things when we wake up,

1476
01:30:10,375 --> 01:30:12,291
let's write down our names.

1477
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:41,000
[MITSUHA]
Writing this...

1478
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:42,583
...doesn't help.

1479
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:45,000
I won't know your name.

1480
01:30:45,083 --> 01:30:47,250
[cries]

1481
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,416
[MITSUHA]
Dad!

1482
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:01,416
Mitsuha!

1483
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,750
There you are!

1484
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:04,958
Don't tell me you're back.

1485
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:06,333
[gasps]

1486
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:12,375
[TAKI] It was almost like seeing
something out of a dream.

1487
01:31:12,458 --> 01:31:16,291
Nothing more or less
than a breathtaking view.

1488
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:50,250
[TAKI]
Huh?

1489
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:53,041
Why am I here?

1490
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:55,166
What am I doing?

1491
01:33:04,166 --> 01:33:07,875
[ANNOUNCER E]
Next is Yoyogi. Yoyogi.

1492
01:33:13,416 --> 01:33:14,375
[gasps]

1493
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:24,166
[ANNOUNCER E] The doors are
closing. Please be careful.

1494
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:29,250
[TAKI] I'm always
searching for something.

1495
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:34,875
This feeling has consumed
me for some time.

1496
01:33:36,291 --> 01:33:38,250
[TAKI] The reason I applied
for this position...

1497
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,875
The landscapes people live in...

1498
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:41,708
To build a city's landscape...

1499
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:44,666
Even Tokyo, it might
vanish too one day.

1500
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:47,583
And so, I wanna make
landscapes that--

1501
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:49,041
How should I put this?

1502
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:52,500
That can continue to
warm people's hearts.

1503
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:54,250
[TAKI groans]

1504
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:56,500
That bad? How many
does that make it?

1505
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:57,750
I've stopped counting.

1506
01:33:57,833 --> 01:33:59,250
Doesn't sound too promising.

1507
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:00,208
Who asked you?

1508
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:01,833
That suit could be the problem.

1509
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:03,583
[TAKI]
It looks just like yours!

1510
01:34:03,666 --> 01:34:05,041
Well, I have two offers.

1511
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:06,041
I have eight myself.

1512
01:34:06,125 --> 01:34:07,291
[TAKI growls]

1513
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:09,291
--[phone rings]
--Huh?

1514
01:34:12,208 --> 01:34:15,708
[TAKI] Is what I'm
searching for ...someone?

1515
01:34:15,791 --> 01:34:18,000
Or somewhere?

1516
01:34:18,083 --> 01:34:21,208
Or am I just searching
for the right job?

1517
01:34:21,291 --> 01:34:23,916
I don't even really know.

1518
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,041
Oh!

1519
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:26,458
You're job hunting, huh?

1520
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:28,083
I haven't had much luck though.

1521
01:34:28,166 --> 01:34:29,458
[OKUDERA]
Hmm...

1522
01:34:29,541 --> 01:34:31,208
Hey, maybe it's the suit
that's killing your chances.

1523
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,916
Does it really look
that bad on me?

1524
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,750
[OKUDERA laughs]

1525
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:40,708
[TAKI]
So why the sudden call today?

1526
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:42,208
[OKUDERA]
I was in the area for work

1527
01:34:42,291 --> 01:34:48,041
and I figured it had been a
while since I saw your face.

1528
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:49,916
Remember that one
time when we went

1529
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,916
all the way to Itomori?

1530
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,833
You were still in high school
back then, so it was...

1531
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:57,041
[TAKI]
Five years ago.

1532
01:34:57,125 --> 01:34:59,041
That long?

1533
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:03,250
It seems like...
I've forgotten a lot.

1534
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:07,916
[TAKI] I don't remember all that
much either, about back then.

1535
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,041
Maybe we argued.

1536
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:13,791
She and Tsukasa went back
to Tokyo without me.

1537
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:17,541
I spent the night alone
on some mountain.

1538
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:19,625
That's about all I remember.

1539
01:35:22,291 --> 01:35:24,500
[TAKI]
But at one point in time,

1540
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:27,166
I found myself strangely
drawn to the incident

1541
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:29,125
involving that comet.

1542
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:33,541
[TAKI] A fragment of the
comet destroyed a town

1543
01:35:33,625 --> 01:35:35,291
in that disaster.

1544
01:35:35,375 --> 01:35:36,875
But miraculously,

1545
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:40,583
most of the people living
in the town were unhurt.

1546
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:43,875
The town happened to be holding
an emergency drill that day,

1547
01:35:43,958 --> 01:35:48,416
and most of its residents
were outside the impact zone.

1548
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,541
The sheer luck and
coincidence of it all

1549
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:54,166
sparked various
conspiracy theories.

1550
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:57,041
I read a lot of articles
about it back then.

1551
01:35:57,125 --> 01:35:59,541
I was kind of obsessed.

1552
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:02,583
But whatever the reason
I had for my interest,

1553
01:36:02,666 --> 01:36:06,166
is a mystery to me now.

1554
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:08,833
I didn't even know
anybody in that town.

1555
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:16,125
[OKUDERA] Thanks for today.
This is far enough.

1556
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:22,208
I do hope that at some point,
you'll find happiness too.

1557
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:28,541
[TAKI] I feel like
I'm always searching.

1558
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:30,250
For something.

1559

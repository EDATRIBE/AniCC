00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,744
I don't know what
you're talking about.

370
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:21,207
Are you dissatisfied with
your Master, Gilgamesh?

371
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,167
Tokiomi invited
me to this world

372
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,336
and maintains my form here.

373
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,797
His greeting was worthy
of my elevated station,

374
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,133
and so I felt that I
had to respond to that.

375
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,969
But I never expected
that he'd be such

376
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,804
a dull and boring person.

377
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,015
So you are unhappy
with him as your Master.

378
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,643
He wants to reach
the Vortex of the Root.

379
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,729
What a boring and
tedious little plan.

380
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:50,319
The unflinching desire for
the "Root" is unique to mages.

381
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,698
It's not for outsiders
to comment upon.

382
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,242
In a sense, the
path to the "Root"

383
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,036
is the path to an
escape from this world.

384
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,707
For us, who are interested
only in the world itself,

385
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,876
it may well be a tedious plan.

386
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,795
Is that so?

387
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,629
True.

388
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,423
I am full of love
for this universe

389
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,550
that is my personal playground.

390
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,803
I have no interest in
realms outside my dominion.

391
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,889
This "Root" of yours does
not concern me in the least.

392
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,224
Perhaps.

393
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,767
But the Grail
is not a device

394
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,061
specifically designed
to seek the Root.

395
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,355
When we say that
it is omnipotent,

396
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,399
we mean that it has
limitless potential

397
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,444
to alter even the reality
of the material world.

398
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,446
So you're saying
the other Masters

399
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,656
have motives
other than Tokiomi's

400
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,658
for wanting to obtain
the Holy Grail.

401
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,036
Tokiomi is an archetypal mage,

402
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,872
and at the same time
extremely orthodox.

403
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,751
What the other Masters seek is
one form or another of success

404
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,586
here in the material world:

405
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,464
prestige, desires, power.

406
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,007
That suits me fine.

407
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,217
I love every one
of those things.

408
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:59,430
You are a king who rules over
the profane and the vulgar,

409
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,598
Gilgamesh.

410
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:04,644
So what is it that
motivates you, Kirei?

411

412

Nothing.

415
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,907
I have no real desire for it.

416
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,909
I seriously doubt that.

417
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,662
Doesn't the Holy Grail
call only those Masters

418
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,331
whom it considers
worthy of possessing it?

419
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,832
So they say.

420
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,709
But why did it choose me?

421
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,420
I have no ideal
or other desire.

422
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,839
So why choose me
for this battle?

423
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,467
No ideal or other desire?

424
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,512
Then why not simply wish
for something like joy?

425
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,638
Ridiculous!

426
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,806
Wish for joy?

427
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,391
You'd ask me to
long for something

428
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,559
that blasphemous and sinful?

429
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,396
Blasphemous and sinful you say?

430
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,439
That's going a
little far, isn't it?

431
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,402
Why the connection
between joy and sin?

432
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,404
Well, I...

433
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,614
True, joy gained by evil means

434
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,282
could be considered sin.

435
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,703
But joy may be attained
through good deeds as well.

436
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,123
What kind of philosophy
calls joy itself a sin?

437
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,542
It's absolutely ludicrous.

438
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,461
Joy is another
quality that I lack.

439
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,298
I seek it, but never find it.

True joy, you see,

446
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,863
might be thought of
as a form of the soul.

447
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,949
The question isn't
whether it exists or not,

448
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,909
but whether you know it.

449
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,706
Kirei, you have yet to see

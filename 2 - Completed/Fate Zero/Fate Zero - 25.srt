Hey, Grandpa and Grandma,

188
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,001
I have a favor to
ask, if it's okay.

189
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,713
What is it, Waver,
speak your mind.

190
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,134
Actually, I'm thinking of taking
some time off from school.

191
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,679
Of course I'll talk to Dad
in Toronto about it first.

192
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,973
There's something that
I wanna spend my time on

193
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,059
more than studies at school.

194
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,728
‐Oh?
‐My goodness.

195
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,439
But what brought
all this on, dear?

196
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,400
Is it school, you aren't
fed up with it, are you?

197
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,110
No, it's not that.

198
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,449
You see, so far I haven't
really been interested

199
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,534
in anything besides studying.

200
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,078
I'm regretting that a little.

201
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:31,251

202
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,628
I'd like to do some traveling.

203
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:37,215
Oh my, did you hear
that, Glen, my dear?

204
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,343
Waver just said something
that sounded exactly

205
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,720
like something Alexey would say.

206
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,848
Anyway, there's a lot
I'd have to do first,

207
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,142

to do it too.

208

For starters, I was thinking
of finding a part‐time job.

209
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,149

210
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,736

a lot shorter,

211
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,240

212
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,909
could I possibly stay here

213
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,329

everything worked out?

214
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,748
Of course you can,
Waver, dear.

215
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,293
It will be so wonderful
to have you live here

216
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,211

left such a mess behind.

Tohsaka's servant.

110
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,423
It was brutal:

111
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,884
his brilliant appearance,
his quick attacks,

112
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,428
everything was golden,
bright, and flashy.

113
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,847
It all happened so fast,
I couldn't tell what‐‐

114

You fool!

115
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,935
If I am to fight someone,
it will be the victor

116
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,563
of all the other battles
between the servants.

117
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,275
Why weren't you paying
attention to how he won?

118
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,943
Well, it matters not.

119
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,196

121
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,409
But...but it was
the middle of the night

122
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,203
and it was all over in a second.

123
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,124
Hey, Rider, normally
a servant only has one

124
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,834
noble phantasm, right?

125
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,337
Yes, of course, that's the rule.

126
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,213
But how many isn't
the correct way

127
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,758
to conceptualize
a noble phantasm.

128
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,384
As I'm sure you already know,

129
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,803
a noble phantasm is
the physical manifestation

130
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,722
of a hero's most
indelible legend

131
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,474
or most famous tale.

132
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,477
Sometimes, it may be
a specific ability

133
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,729
or a special method of attack.

134
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,898
So, then, is there
a noble phantasm

135
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,901
that consists of throwing
dozens of swords at an opponent?

136
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,571
A sword that makes copies
of itself, really?

137
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,782
Huh, yes, it's possible.

138
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,452
That could still qualify
as a single noble phantasm.

139
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,998
But, wait,
those swords weren't copies.

140
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,710
Each one of them had
a completely different shape.

141
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,587
Ah, forget it,
we'll just have

142
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,881
to discover each
of our enemies' identities

143
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,841

Yes, actually
it'll be more fun!

148
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:59,270
Food, sex, sleep, and war!

149
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,106
Whatever you do,
you should always

Request granted.

182
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:17,182
In my role as overseer
of this war, I, Risei Kotomine,

183
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,434
guarantee your safety here.

184
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,102
Enter in peace.

185
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,649
Father, isn't this
church being watched?

186
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,360
No, this holy place
has been declared

187
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,154
a neutral sanctuary.

188
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,699
The Holy Church will censure
any master who dares defy

189
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,076
the decree.

190
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,204
Then, you're sure
it's safe here?

191
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,039
Mmm.

192
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,125
But still, you should
keep watch just in case.

193
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,545
Post a guard here
at all times just to be sure.

194
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,049
Yes, understood.

195
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,052
Tell me, who was
observing the battle?

196
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,012
Before the battle,
I detected the presence

197
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,890
of familiars from
four separate masters.

198
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,725
Two days ago,
I was able to confirm

199
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,520
the summoning of
the final servant, Caster.

200
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,523
All of the Holy Grail War
servants should have now arrived

201
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,734
and the fighting
will begin shortly.

202
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,112
One unaccounted for.

203
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,738
I had hoped that all the masters

204
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,573
would be watching
and taking note

205
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,742
of the encounter.

206
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,119
At this point in the war,

207
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,079
observing the three
families' estates

208
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,666
would be a master's
obvious course of action.

209
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,461
That's right, and if they
can't even think to do that,

210
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,297
it would never even begin
to occur to them to worry

211
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,259
about the existence
of us assassins.

212
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,760
(chuckles)

213
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,221
We spirits of the shadows
shall sneak up behind

214
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,432
those masters who believe
Assassin to be dead.

215
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,351
We shall sneak up behind them,

216
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,603
and this time, we shall become

217
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,065
true shadows in the darkness.

218
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,818
The battle for
the grail is now at hand.

219
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:56,197
At last, it's time for the
fourth Holy Grail War to begin.

220
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,117
These tired old eyes
of mine will finally see

221
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,287
a wondrous miracle
be performed.

222
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,460
(jet engine roaring)

223
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,306
Oh, my!

224
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,725
So, this is where
Kiritsugu was born?

225
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,561
Well, Saber, how did
you enjoy your journey

226
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,313
through the sky?

227
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,648
It was really
nothing to speak of.

228
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,651
It was far simpler than I
had actually anticipated.

229
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,737
Yes, well, I suppose
that flying must be

230
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,406
nothing special to
a real hero, right?

231
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,491
No, that's not it.

232
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,037
Upon materialization,
all servants receive knowledge

233
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,872
of the modern world.

234
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,750
If required, I could
even pilot this aircraft

235
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,251
with relative ease.

236
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,961
You could?

237
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,213
Are you serious?

238
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,590
My riding skill
allows me to command

239
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,468
any beast or vehicle,
with the only exception

240
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,596
being phantasmal
or divine beasts.

241
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,599
Once I put the saddle
between my legs and take

242
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,184
the reins, I'm in control.

243
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,270
The saddle between
your legs and take the reins?

244
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,271
(chuckles)

245
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,356
What is it?

246
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,025
Did I say something
amusing to you?

247
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,194
Uh‐uh.

248
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,862
Still, you must be
the only servant

249
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,074
who has flown in
an airplane in physical form.

250
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,159
I apologize for that.

251
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,203
If only I could
take spirit form.

252
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,164
No, I didn't mean it
like that, really.

253
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,584
I never get tired
of watching you.

254
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,295
Irisviel, is there
something odd about me?

255
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,547
No, no, not at all.

256
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,384
When you laugh like that,
there seems to be some

257
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,427
hidden meaning behind it.

258
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,512
What is it?

259
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,847
I want you to be frank with me.

260
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,892
It means that your being stuck
in physical form isn't without

261
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,227
its merits.

262
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,229
It's given me many
enjoyable hours

263
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,398
of choosing outfits for you.

264
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:57,360
Irisviel, is this manner
of dress truly common

265
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,070
for women of this era?

266
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,906
I choose it for you
to balance out my own outfit.

267
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,032
You don't care for it?

268
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,450
No, it is fine.

269
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,953
It is rather easy
to move in, and besides,

270
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,080
I'm used to dressing as a man.

271
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,670
This place is so very alive!

272
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,672
Kiritsugu was supposed
to have arrived here

273
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,757
in Japan already, wasn't he?

274
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,260
That's right,
12 hours before us.

275
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,928
But, don't worry,
he'll find us as soon

276
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,972
as he's certain
the time is right.

277
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,349
For the moment, we'll just
have to keep an eye on things

278
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,728
so that we can act
when the time comes.

279
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,605
We've come all this way,
I'd like to enjoy the city

281
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,650
That's dangerous.

282
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,695
We should first concentrate
on securing a base of operations

283
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,072
and discuss plans
with Kiritsugu.

284
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,825
Well, yes, I suppose
you're right about that.

142

equitable agreement.

conditional ceasefire?

159

The first is that you

you may have gathered

Agreed.

164
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,869
Our second condition is

165
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,871
that Kirei Kotomine
be removed from

in any way he be killed,

169
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,925
but I insist that until
this battle is over,

170
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,718
he be expelled from Fuyuki,

171
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,805

from Japan entirely.

174
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,105

and the so‐called Inquisitor.

00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,014
and scout out the
route ahead for us.

189
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,517
(engine grumbles)

190
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,564
We should go now as well.

191
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,524
(engine turns over)

192
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,238
Ma‐‐madam, what's the matter?

193
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,574
Please drive, Maiya.

194
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,741
You sure?

195
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,703
Tohsaka will suspect
something's wrong.

196
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,131
What's happening to me
really isn't unexpected.

197
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,466
It was actually inevitable.

198
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,178
Honestly, the fact that
I've been able to function

199
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,472
as a human for this long...

200
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,684
is really quite a miracle.

201
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,061
Does Kiritsugu
know about this?

202
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,647
Yes, but don't tell Saber.

203
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,399
She has a crucial
battle to fight

204
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,109
ahead of her.

205
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,485
I don't want
to distract her

206
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,904
with all of this.

207
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,406
But listen, Maiya,
there's something

208
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,450
I need to tell you.

209
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,036
I am a homunculus
created specifically

210
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,663
for the Holy Grail War.

211
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,582
You know about that, right?

212
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,791
Yes.

213
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,419
Grandfather Acht
ingrained in the vessel

214
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,005
an instinct for
self‐preservation

215
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,841
so that it would avoid
all danger and safeguard

216
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,927
the Grail to its completion.

217
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,762
He disguised the vessel
so he could hide it

218
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,349
in plain sight
and called it Irisviel.

219
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,185
That is who I am.

220
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,478
But how?

221
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,146
Then that means
that you are...

222
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,522
Very soon now.

223
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,943
I will revert back
to what I originally was.

224
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,695
When that happens,
I won't even be able

225
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,489
to talk to you
or anyone else

226
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,407
like this anymore.

227
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,701
That's the reason why
Kiritsugu gave me

228
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,245
Saber's scabbard to keep.

229
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,250
Avalon, are you familiar
with its effects?

230
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,045
It halts aging and provides
an infinite healing ability.

231
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,713
Or so I'm told.

232
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,382
Its effects are
what have prevented

233
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,384
the hollow
shell that is me

234
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,469
from collapsing
in on itself.

235
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,055
Of course, they stop
working as soon

236
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,890
as Saber is away.

237
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,059
And I start to deteriorate.

238
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,646
Madam, why are you
telling me all this?

239
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,525
Because, Maiya Hisau,
under no circumstances

240
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,819
would you ever pity me.

241
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,697
You would accept
me for what I am.

242
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,323
That's why I tell you.

243
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,077
Madam, Irisviel,
I'm afraid I've always

244
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,413
thought that you
were beyond my reach.

245
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,957
No, I'm not really.

Do you understand?

247
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,668
Yes.

248
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:17,964
Even if it costs
me my life, Irisviel,

249
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,217
I will see you through
to the very end.

That's the reason
my master has worked

335
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,336
so hard to avoid
using his command seals,

336
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,379
because when
all the battles

337
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,631
are finally over,
he will require them

338
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,217

servant to commit suicide.

339
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,471
So then the loyalty
Tokiomi has shown me

340
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,349

a lie from the very beginning?

341

To put it yet another way,

342
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,395
my master is first

344
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,191

a heroic spirit,

illusions about his idols.

at last you have

348
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,035

for a man will

349

of entertainment.

351
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,292
Now then, what
will you do, Gilgamesh?

352
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:08,212
Will you now choose
to remain loyal to Tokiomi

353
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,881
and then punish me for
rebelling against him?

354
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,634
Ah, a fair question, indeed.

355
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,678
Regardless of his treachery,

356
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,140
Tokiomi still supplies
me with the mana I require.

357
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,183
Were I to abandon
my master, it would

358
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,604
hamper my ability
to remain materialized.

359
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,981
Oh, come to think of it,

360
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,567
there is a partnerless
master I know of.

361
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,777
One who is actively
searching for a servant

362
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,363
that is free and
unbound by a contract.

363
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,239
Hmph.

364
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,908
Now that you mention
it, you're right.

365
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,453
But of course,
there is a question

366
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,413
of whether that man
is a worthy master

367
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,665
in the eyes of
the King of Heroes?

368
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,917
He will suffice.

369
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,503
He is a bit stiff
and humorless, perhaps,

370
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,340
but he has great
potential for growth.

371
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,967
He may yet prove
himself a fine source

372
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,385
of entertainment for me.

373
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,638
Hm.

374
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,434
I've been waiting
for you, Kirei.

375
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,853
I came to say goodbye
and thank you before

376
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,188
I departed Fuyuki.

377
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,235
First, I'd like to say
that I'm still very proud

378
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,905
to have had you
as my student.

379
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,491
I hope you will
maintain good relations

380
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,076
with the Tohsaka family,

381
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,788
as throughout the years
your late father always did.

382
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,581
All right?

383
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,667
Your words honor me.

384
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,461
Once this Grail War
has finally come to an end,

385
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,339
Kirei, I'd like for you
to help train my young

386
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,257
daughter, Rin,
to be a mage.

387
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,054
It's rather simple,
but in essence,

388
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,306
this is a will
I've prepared.

389
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,891
I thought it prudent
to be ready in the event

390
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,269
the worst happened
and I did not survive.

391
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,022
It leaves the entire
wealth of the Tohsaka family

392
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,148
to Rin.

393
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,110
And names you as
her legal guardian

394
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,569
until she comes of age.

395
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,906
Leave it to me.

396
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,616
I shall do all I can

397
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,662
to look after your daughter
and keep her safe from any harm.

398
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,622
Thank you.

399
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,915
Kirei.

What is this?

401
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,669
A little something for you.

402
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,462
A gift from me.

403
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,463
Open it.

404
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,636
An Azoth dagger.

405

mastery of magic,

406
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,143

of your apprenticeship to me.

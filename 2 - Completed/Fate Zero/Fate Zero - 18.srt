Naturally, since their
motto is All To Ourselves,

383
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,665

suspect of knowing the secret.

to cover this up.

385

It was the mages who set
a torch to the village.

So then whose side are you on?

I'm looking for a mage

I suppose that word doesn't

There was someone who
became a Dead Apostle first,

395
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,864
someone infected
them with the medium

396
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,534

into those creatures,

their transformation.

The son of a bitch mage
who conjured that medium up

399
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,835
should be laying low
somewhere on this island.

412
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:45,374
Shirley used the

Oh, well, that's
most unfortunate.

414

Don't be stupid.

A Dead Apostle that can't
control its blood lust

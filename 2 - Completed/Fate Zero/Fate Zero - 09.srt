that, Kayneth?

When I asked him
what he would wish for

these Command Seals,

With my limited
skills as a healer,

102
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,756

Command Seals by force.

104

The bearer's willing
consent is the sole way

without resistance.

106

put a tremendous stress

on the patient.

116
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,087
I think it will take some
time yet before she wakes up.

117
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,257

Tell him I feel that we must
pursue Caster immediately.

124
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,318
But, Saber.

125
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,946
Inaction on our part
will mean the deaths

126
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,990
of many more
innocent children.

127
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,076

128
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,119

130
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,796
How long before Maiya's back?

131
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,465
Not too long, but she
has to stay in bed

132
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,300
for another day or two.

133
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,886
I see.

134
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,223
You and Saber stay here.

135
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,059

138
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,900
She thinks we should go

139
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,986
Apparently so.

140
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:52,532
Are you angry at Saber for
not interfering with Lancer?

141
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,037
Iri, saving a few children,

142
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,330
or even a few dozen
for that matter,

143
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,458
is not our goal.

144
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,043
Saber probably never doubted

145
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,712
that Lancer would
spare me that day,

146
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,340
but if Lancer had
betrayed her, then what?

147
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,136
Our Grail War would have
ended right then and there.

148
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,974
There's no need to tell
her where I'm going.

149

151
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,994
Mistress Sola‐Ui, how
fares Master Kayneth?

152
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,330
Not well, I'm afraid.

153
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,750
But I've done
everything I can for him.

154
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,754
This isn't your
fault, Lancer.

155
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,215
Kayneth brought
it upon himself.

156
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,383
All it means is
that the Grail War

157
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,345
was far too much
for him to handle.

158
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,890
It's not that, I just...

159
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,892

00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,361
Kayneth has

your master to me.

but I cannot consent.

167
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,753
You what?

168
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,131
As a servant, do you
not manifest physically

169
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,424
in this world using my mana?

170
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,552
And now I also have
Kayneth's consent,

171
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,262
as well as the Command Seals.

172
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,140
Before I am a servant
of the Grail War,

173
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,933
I am foremost a knight,

174
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:45,728
and a knight can only
serve but one master.

175
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,314
Am I so unworthy of
being your master?

176
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,608
I have already told you
that is not the issue.

177
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,945
Look me in the eye
when you speak!

178
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,162
Lancer, fight beside me.

179
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,330
Please, you must protect me.

180
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,957
Lend me your support.

181

Come and help me
win the Holy Grail!

182
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,630

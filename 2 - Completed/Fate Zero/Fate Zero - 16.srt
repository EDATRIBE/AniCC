with another party.

370
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,069
So I had to eliminate
the master and the servant

371
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,446
simultaneously.

372
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,114
No, Kiritsugu.

373
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,490
Not to me.

374
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,034
Talk to Saber.

375
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,370
She's the one who needs
to hear your words now.

376
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,496
No.

377
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,373
Honor, glory...

378
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,126
there's really no point
in speaking to a killer

379
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,920
who extols the
virtue of such things.

380
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,258
You would even insult
chivalry to my face, monster!

381
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,178
A knight cannot
save the world.

382
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,930
Knights call certain
methods of fighting good,

383
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,183
and others evil,
acting as if

384
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:06,103
there were some sacred
nobility to the battlefield.

385
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:10,232
Such illusions created by
heroes throughout history

386
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,776
have led countless
young men to their

387
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,152
bloody deaths,

388
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,780
all for the sake of
this glory and honor

389
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,073
they all extol.

390
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,699
They are not illusions!

391
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,327
Even the taking
of a life in battle

392
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,454
as an act as a human being

393
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,414
must have ideals,

394
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,291
otherwise every war
would bring the very

395
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,336
fires of hell to this world.

396
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,171
And there you go...

397
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,382
you heard her, Iris.

398
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,175
Our heroic spirit over there

399
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,720
considers a battlefield
to be better than hell.

400
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,639
What a joke.

401
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,350
A battlefield is hell itself.

402
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,977
There's no hope
to be had on one.

403
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,439
There is nothing but
unspeakable despair.

404
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,942
Just a soulless
cry we call victory.

405
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,528
Paid for by the pain
of the defeated.

406
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,490
But humanity has never
recognized this truth.

407
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,034
And the reason is that
in every era a dazzling

408
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,454
hero has blinded the people
with their legends and kept

409
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,833
them from seeing the evil
of bloodshed they bring.

410
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,836
True human nature
has not advanced

411
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,672
a step beyond the Stone Age.

412
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,841
Tell me this, Kiritsugu.

413
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,802
Do you force Saber
to endure such humiliation

414
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,847
because of your hatred
for the heroic spirits?

415
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,098
Of course not.

416
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,642
Personal feelings
don't enter into it.

417
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,060
I will win the Holy Grail

418
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,854
and save the world.

419
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,022
And I will wage
that war with the most

420
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,567
appropriate weapons
I have at my disposal.

421
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:39,029
Justice and righteousness
cannot save the world.

422
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,365
I care nothing
for such things.

423
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,702
Kiritsugu, don't
you understand?

424
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,163
If you do evil
to stop evil,

425
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,665
that rage and hatred
will give rise

426
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,042
to new conflict.

427
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,627
Kiritsugu Emiya,

428
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,546
I do not know
what betrayed you,

429
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,382
or what has caused
you to lose all hope,

430
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,218
but your sorrow
and rage are found

431
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:05,264
only in those who at one
time sought for justice.

432
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,059
Kiritsugu, in youth,
your true self,

433
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,563
wished to be
a hero, did it not?

434
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,398
A hero to save the world.

435
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,608
You believed in that.

436
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,902
You desired it
more than life.

437
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,236
Am I wrong?

438
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,239
♪

439
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,742
I will break this
endless cycle.

440
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,620
The Grail will make
that possible.

441
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,955
I'll ensure that the
blood I spill in Fuyuki

442
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,917
is the last that
humanity will ever shed.

443
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,794
If that means I must
stain my hands with

444
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,046
every evil in the world,

445
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,923
I don't care.

446
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,425
If that will
save the world,

447
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,886
then I do it gladly.

448
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,888
(car putters off)

449
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,856
Kiritsugu has left, hasn't he?

450
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,233
Irisviel?

451
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,114
Irisviel!

452
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,418
This cannot be allowed!

453
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,003
An alliance at this stage?

454
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,463
Let me tell you
the truth behind

455
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,672
the Holy Grail War.

456
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,133
Go and tell them
we accept to die

457
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,385
to make his dream a reality.

458
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,929
Such a boring end.

459
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,847
I'll see you soon, Father.

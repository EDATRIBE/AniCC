Grail is a treasure

00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,196
Indeed, however there
is no reason whatsoever

136
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:12,492

mongrels of your ilk.

137
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,620
Wait a minute, you're

138

140
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:26,005
Which means, Rider, if you
were to swear fealty to me,

141
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,007
I could lend you
a Grail or two,

142
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,218
whenever you felt
the need for one.

143
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,388
Sorry, that is totally
out of the question.

144
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,766
But tell me, Archer, surely
you have no special interest

145
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,810
in the Holy Grail
itself, do you?

146
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,689
Of course not, but I must
render my judgment upon those

147
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,150
who would dare to
steal treasure from me.

148
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,194
It's simply a
matter of principle.

149
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,448
Hmm, I'm curious, Archer.

150
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,782
On what morals and reasoning

151
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,160
are these principles
of yours based?

152
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,538
It is the law,
my law which I set down

153
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,457
as the rightful king.

154
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,042

155
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,754
Living by one's own law
is the epitome of kingship.

Nevertheless, I desire
the Holy Grail so badly

157
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,970
I could almost taste it.

158
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,597
And it has
always been my style

159
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,849
to just take
what I want.

160
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,643
After all, the Great Iskandar

161
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,688
is the King of
Conquerors, is he not?

162
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,648
Right and wrong
are irrelevant.

163
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,359
You break the law
and I will punish you.

164
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,446
There is no place
for discussion.

165
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,697
Hmm.

166
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,241
Which means that all
we have left to us

167
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,537

the field of combat.

168
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,624

still like us to help you

169
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,209
finish this off tonight?

170
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,878
There'll be plenty of time
to kill each other after.

171
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,215
Indeed, or do you dare
sit there and cast aspersions

172

you the honor of providing?

173
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,678
No, of course not,
I wouldn't dream

174

drink go to waste.

rightful ownership
lies with another

180

and not yourself.

181
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,694
And yet you would
just take it by force?

182
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,573
What makes the Grail
so important to you?

183
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,919
Reincarnation.

184
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,003
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

185
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,171
What?

186
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,923
Wait a minute, wasn't
your goal supposed to be

187
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,049
world conquest?

188
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,677
Ah!

189
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:40,223
Idiot, as if I would leave the
conquering to some mere cup.

190
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,601
Conquering the world
is my dream to make true.

191
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,187
The wish I would ask
of the Holy Grail

192
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,023
is the first step
towards that goal.

193
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:53,069
Mongrel, you would dare
challenge me for my treasure

194
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,155
over something so trivial?

195
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,283
Even in magic lends
us form in this world,

196
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:02,537
ultimately we remain Servants.

197
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,874
I wish to live
as flesh and blood

198
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,419
within this world
in which I find myself.

199
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,212
And with
nothing but my body

200
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,464
I shall defy both
heaven and Earth,

201
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,760
succeeding in that endeavor is
the true meaning of conquest.

202
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,220
Thus it begins.

203
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:25,101
Then proceeds onward
and finally is finished.

204
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,979
Such is the path
of my conquest.

205
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,274
Hmm, then the
matter is settled.

206
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,694
I shall take great pleasure
in killing you myself.

207
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,072
You don't have to
remind me of the obvious.

208
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,699
I have every
intention of plundering

209
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,744
your abundant storehouse
until it's been laid bare,

210
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,162
so get ready.

211
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:48,666
That is hardly fitting of
how a true king should behave.

212
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:53,880
Oh, well then, let us hear what
you would ask of the Grail,

213
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,423
if you were to win it.

214
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,677
♪

215
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,765
I wish for my
homeland's salvation.

216
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:08,144

wish granting device,

217
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,022

fate of destruction.

party of all things?

Archer to his own devices?

220
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,955
Hmm, it can't be helped.

221
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,499
After all, when one
is King of Kings,

222
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,751
it simply wouldn't
do to turn one's back

223
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,545
on an interesting invitation.

224
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:39,092
Incidentally, Kirei, how do you
judge the relative strengths

225
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,761
of Rider and Archer?

226
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,972
Rider may very well
possess a trump card

227
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,058
that surpasses
the gordius wheel.

228
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,936
I believe we should
put this to the test.

229
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,647
Hmm, with Rider
and his Master drinking

230
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,065
and their guard's down,

231
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,400
a better chance
to attack them

232
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,819
will never again
present itself.

233
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,322
The odds of victory don't
matter to our overall plan.

234
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,241
Even if Assassin is defeated,

235
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,286
as long as he can gauge
their relative strengths,

236
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,913
our objective will
be accomplished.

237
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,540
We do have the option

238
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,085
of launching an attack
right now, Kirei.

239
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,920
I have no objections.

240
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,256
I believe it will
take roughly ten minutes

241
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,634
to summon all the Assassins.

242
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,012
Fine, give the order.

243
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,723
It is a large gamble,
but even if it fails,

244
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,058
we stand to lose nothing.

245
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,104
Use a command seal to give
Assassin the following order.

246
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:37,317
Be victorious no matter
the cost, got it?

247
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,990
Hey, King of Knights,
did you just say

248
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,242
that you would change fate?

249
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,454
Does that mean that you wish
to change events long past?

250
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,999
Indeed, even if it is a
wish that a miracle alone

251
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,625
can not fulfill.

252
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,211
If the Holy Grail
is truly omnipotent,

253
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,172
then surely...

254
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,049
(snicker)

255
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,344
Um, Saber, just so
I am clear on this,

256
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,972
it was back during
your time that his country

257
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,267
you call Britain
was conquered and fell?

258
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,227
When it was under
your rule?

259
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,939
Correct, that is why
I can not allow it.

260
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,733
And that is why
I regret it.

261
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,985
Why I want to
alter that outcome,

262
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,447
for it was I and none
other who was to blame.

263
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,408
(snickering)

264
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,078
Archer, what's so amusing?

265
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,373
You call yourself a king and
are praised by all as such,

266
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,375
and yet you feel regret.

267
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,127
(laughing)

268
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,631
How can I not laugh
at such nonsense?

269
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:46,219
Saber, surely you
do not really mean

270
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,180
that you would erase
the marks that you yourself

271
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,473
have left on history?

272
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,767
I do, and what of it?

273
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,102
Why do you laugh?

274
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,105
My beloved country to which
I devoted my whole life

275
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,189
was destroyed.

276
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,024
Why is my sadness
about that strange?

277
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,193
Did you hear
that drivel, Rider?

278
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,528
Did you hear
what this little girl

279
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,780
who calls herself
King of Knights said?

280
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,367
Her beloved country to which
she devoted her whole life.

281
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,452
Why is that
humorous to you?

282
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,539
For their
country's prosperity,

283
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:18,251
a true king should be
willing to make any sacrifice.

284
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,670
You are wrong.

285
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,713
The king does
not devote himself.

286
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,423
It is the nation
and the people

287
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,843
who must devote
themselves to the king.

288
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,886
You have
reversed the concept.

289
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,054
I what?

290
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,473
Those are the words
of a brutal tyrant.

291
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,724
Just so.

292
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,894
We are heroes precisely
because we are tyrants.

293
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,981
However, Saber, if a
king regrets his rule

294
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,276
or regrets the manner in which
his rule came to an end,

295
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,986
that king is
nothing but a fool,

296
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,488
worse than the
tyrant you disdain.

297
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,033
Iskandar, your reign ended
with all your heirs slain

298
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,287
and your great empire
broken up by civil war.

299
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,583
Do you mean to say you have
no regrets about that end?

300
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,751
None at all.

301
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,588
Not if it came to pass
by my own decisions

302
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,506
and by the
considerable sacrifices

303
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,717
of my many retainers.

304
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,052
Its destruction
was inevitable.

305
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,889
I shall mourn it and
shed tears over it,

306
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,391
but I shall
never regret it.

307
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,309
But you‐‐

308
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,519
Let alone
undo it all!

309
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,521
Such an act would be
an insufferable insult

310
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,983
to all those who fought and
bled and died alongside me.

311
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,986
It is only a warrior who can
find glory in destruction,

312
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,947
worthless is a king who
fails to protect the weak.

313
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,742
A just rule
guided by just laws,

314
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,412
those are the true
duties of a king.

315
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,248
So you, the king
of your realm,

316
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,250
are a slave
to what is right?

317
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,460
I am.

318
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,339
Kings are martyrs
to their ideals.

319
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,092
That is not the way
a person should live.

320
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,928
If I rule a
nation as king,

321
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,223
I can not expect
to live as a person.

322
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,892
King of Conquerors,
you seek the Grail

323
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,644
merely for
your own benefit.

324
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,189
And as such, you could
never understand that.

325
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,191
You, who became a ruler

326
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,610
only to satisfy
your endless greed.

327
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,529
A king without greed is
even worse than a figurehead!

328
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,739
(gasp)

329
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,532
Saber, you said you would

330
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,118
martyr yourself
for your ideals.

331
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,453
In life you must
have been something

332
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,498
akin to the purest
of all the saints.

333
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:24,210
A proud and noble figure
at the very least.

334
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,588
But who can truly admire
the rough and thorny path

335
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,132
that a martyr must
follow in life?

336
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,803
Who actually dreams
of such an ending?

(wind blowing)

338
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,349
A king must be
greedier than any other.

339
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:42,144
He must laugh more loudly
and rage for much longer

340
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,940
and embody the very extreme
of all things good and evil.

341
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,610
That is why his retainers
envy his very existence.

342
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,445
And adore him as well.

343
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,781

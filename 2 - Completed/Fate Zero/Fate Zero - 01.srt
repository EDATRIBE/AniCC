agreement among all involved

73
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,259
To ensure this rule is kept,
someone of the Holy Church

74
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,845

But wait, how can this
be considered fair?

84
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,416
It's a conflict of interest
for the overseer's child

85
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,418

86
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,253

87
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,924
Perhaps it's time
we got to the point.

88
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,718
Kirei, everything we've
spoken of thus far

89
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,514
is just the official background
of the Holy Grail War.

90
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,767
However, there is an additional
reason I've introduced you

91
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,145
to Mr. Tokiomi
Tohsaka here today.

92
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,772
And what would that be?

93
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,566
Actually, we found
proof a long time ago

94
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,985
that the Holy Grail that
will appear in Fuyuki

95
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,781
is not the sacred relic that
belonged to the Son of God.

96
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,493
So I gathered, otherwise,
an order to retrieve it

97
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,121
would've been given to us of
the Eighth Sacrament Assembly.

98
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,541
Be that as it may,
Fuyuki's Holy Grail

99
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,709
is far too powerful to ignore.

100
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,462
It is an omnipotent
wish‐granting device.

101
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,631
Who knows what disaster
it could unleash

102
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,425
should it happen to fall
into the wrong hands.

103
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,221
In which case, the best course
of action would be to ensure

104
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,307
that the Fuyuki Grail
falls into the right hands,

105
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,935
hands that would not misuse it.

106
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,313
The Tohsakas are a family
of mages, but they are mages

107
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,692
with a long history of
friendship with the Church.

108
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,986
We know what kind
of person Tokiomi is,

109
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,029
and more important
than anything else,

110
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,574
the Tohsakas' ultimate
intentions for the Grail

111
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,784
are plain and honorable.

112
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,870
To reach the root.

113
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,164
That is the Tohsaka
family's sole desire.

114
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,209
But the Einzberns and
Matous have both forgotten

115
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,169
the wish we once
shared with them,

116
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,464
and have other less
altruistic plans now.

117
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,425
It goes without
saying that the plans

118
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,303
of the other masters
will be even worse.

119
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,264
Who knows what dark desire
they may harbor for the power

120
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,975
of the Grail should
they obtain it.

121
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,687
That being said, I assume that
the goal of my participation

122
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,523
is to ensure Tokiomi
Tohsaka's victory,

123
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,525
rather than to prevail myself.

124
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,904

conduct ourselves in a manner

125
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,365
that will maintain the
appearance of us being enemies.

126
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,285
However, we will actually
be working together

defeat the other five masters,

00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,538
You are very welcome, Rin,
I'm glad you like it.

182
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,000
(indistinct conversations)

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,628
Where's Sakura?

184
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,842
Sakura's gone now.

185
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,224
‐What did she mean?
‐Sakura is‐‐

186
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,309
well, she's no
longer my daughter

187
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,604
or Rin's little sister.

188
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,065
She's now with...

189
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,193
the Matou family.

190
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,903
But why?

191
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,823
The Matous want a child
who carries in them

192
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,908
the blood of a mage.

193
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,286
You know why, better
than anyone else.

194
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,997
♪

195
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,583
The head of the Tohsaka
family decided to give

196
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,671
our ancient allies, the Matous,
that which they requested.

197
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,633
It wasn't my place to speak out.

198
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,593
You're all right with that?

199
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,304
When I married into
the Tohsaka family,

200
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,640
when I decided to marry a mage,

201
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,977
I knew what might
be required of me.

202
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,770
And you're all right with that?

203
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,940
The reality is that a
clan bearing mage blood

204
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,610
can never expect to enjoy the
happiness of a normal family.

205
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,112
That's not true!

206
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,990
When you married him you wanted
happiness, you wanted‐‐

207

Enough!

208
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,827
This is between the
Tohsakas and the Matous.

209
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,122
You left the world of
mages a long time ago.

210
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,291
This doesn't concern you.

♪

212
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,131
If you get the chance
to see Sakura again,

213
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,466
please be kind to her.

214
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,762
She was always very fond of you.

215
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,353
So, the failure
actually had the nerve

216
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,064
to show his face here.

217
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,150
I distinctly
remember telling you

218
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,110
to stay far away
from this house,

219
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,031
and to never darken my
doorstep again, Kariya.

220
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,826
I heard you adopted the
Tohsaka's second daughter.

221
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,995
Then you have sharp ears.

222
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,581
Is it really so
important to keep mages

223
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,167
in the Matou lineage
that you have to do this?

224
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,169
Would you tell
me we're wrong to?

225
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,879
You of all people?

226
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,672
Tell me who's fault
do you think it is

227
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,092
for our present
reduced circumstances.

228
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:02,180
Kariya, had you only agreed
to carry on the family name

229
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,349
and to learn the
secrets of the Matou,

230
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,517
things would never
have gotten this bad,

231
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,270
and that little girl would
still be with her mother.

232
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,190
You're not fooling
anyone, you vampire.

233
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,693
You only want the Grail to
give yourself eternal youth.

234
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,737
You just wanna live forever.

235
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,906
(laughing)

236
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,492
Nearly 60 years have
passed since the last time

237
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,787
the masters gathered, but
the Matous have no pawns yet

238
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,581
to offer for the
fourth Holy Grail War.

239
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,501
Though you have it inside
you, your brother Byakuya

240
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,545
lacks the power needed
to control a servant.

241
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,465
But even if we forfeit this
round, we could still win

242
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:41,386
the next in 60 years
if we prepare ourselves.

243
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,013
The Tohsaka girl's womb
will one day bear us

244
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,891
a powerful mage,
one who could prevail.

245
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,812
She has a lot of potential,
that one, she could be the key.

246
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:54,941
So then in other words, if you
can get your hands on the Grail,

247
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,945
you won't need Sakura
Tohsaka anymore.

248
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,365
What is it you're
scheming, Kariya?

249
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,784
A trade, Zouken.

250
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:09,330
Next year I will return from
the Grail War, Grail in hand,

251
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,043
and in return, you
will release Sakura.

252
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,878
Don't be a stupid idiot.

253
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,048
You're a failure and you haven't
trained a day in your life.

254
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,426
You actually believe
that in a single year

255
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,721
you'll achieve the power
to control a servant?

256
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,140
You have the secret magic
to make that happen

257
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,519
and you know it, using your
special worm techniques.

258
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,316
‐So?
‐You can implant me

00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,154
Kariya, you want to die?

261
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,197
The Matous should
rely on themselves

262
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,741
to gain what they want.

263

I won't let anyone
else get involved.

scream her head off.

But on the fourth, she settled
down and finally stopped.

Early this morning, I threw
her down into the worm pit

274

to see just how long she'd last.

She's been in there for over 12
hours and she's still breathing.

The Tohsakas have very
powerful inner spirits.

‐What will you do now?

She's a broken little girl
ripped from the life she knew,

and violated by worms
from head to toe.

280

But if you still wish to
save her from this ordeal,

281
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,597
I might be willing
to think about it.

282

I agree.

283

But I intend to
continue her education

284
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,562
until you show results.

285
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,190
That point is not negotiable.

286
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,692
I still expect to achieve
victory in the next war

287
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,321
60 years from now, but
should you somehow manage

288
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,158
to retrieve the Grail in
this war, all the better.

289
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,536
Naturally, I'll no
longer need the girl.

290

In that case, her education
will only last a year,

291
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,709
and then she'll be free
to go where she wants.

292
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,546
You won't renege on your
words, Zouken Matou?

the breeding ground for a week.

It's a report from the spies I
sent to the London Clock Tower.

302
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:54,412
It says that the Grail chose a
master from within the tower,

303
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,373
the headquarters of
the Mage's Association.

304

‐Who is it?
‐A rather big problem.

305

The eldest son of
the Archibald family,

306
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,630
a ninth generation mage.

307
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,925
Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald.

(clock chiming)

309
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,388
In the world of mages,

310
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,266
a long and distinguished
lineage is everything.

311
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,268
Nothing else matters.

312
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,979
This is because magic
will not yield up

313
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,190
her secrets in a
single generation.

314
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,525
A parent passes on the
fruits of a lifetime

315
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,986
of magical training
to his child.

316
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,322
Thus, the older
the family of mages,

317
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,116
the greater their power
ultimately becomes.

318
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,327
You are no doubt
wondering why I begin

319
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,662
today's lecture with
something so basic.

320
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,582
It is because a student
from this class submitted

321
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:43,127
a fascinating paper
to me yesterday.

322
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,756
"How Wizardry Should Be
in the New Century."

323
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,884
It attempts to make a case
objecting to the longstanding

324
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,053
traditions of
which I just spoke.

325
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,181
It claims that if one were to
achieve a deep understanding

326
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,308
of the techniques and
precise control over

327
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,269
mana application, it
would allow one to overcome

328
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,897
any difference
in inherent ability.

329
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,942
In short, even someone
with diluted blood could,

330
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,153
through his own efforts,
become a master mage.

331
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,988
To be honest, I've
learned something

332
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,115
from reading this paper.

333
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,869
Silence, please.

334
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,663
I will be perfectly frank.

335
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,667
This paper is nothing but
immature juvenile fantasies.

336
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,001
Huh?

337
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,504
Blood determines a mage's
powers and abilities.

338
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:31,175
This is a hard and unchanging
reality of this world.

339
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,427
Even for you, Waver Velvet.

340
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,722
I am very, very disappointed
that one of my students

341
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,267
would indulge in this
moronic nonsense.

342
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,686
Sir, I was only trying
to raise a question

343
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,770
the Mage's Association

344
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,397
has become too
reluctant to address.

345
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,817
Mr. Velvet, if I
recall correctly,

346
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,237
your family has produced mages
for only three generations.

347
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,697
Isn't that right?

348
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,908
Listen to me, compared
to the Mage's Association's

349
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,910
long and illustrious history,

350
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,663
your family is no more
than a newborn baby.

351
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,082
Don't you think a baby
should learn to speak

352
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,752
before it tries
to voice an opinion?

353

529
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,918
‐And next‐‐
‐Kiritsugu Emiya.

530
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:12,089
Newest member of the Einzbern
family and their trump card,

531
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:16,426
and the man that I love.

532
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,597
And the fourth master‐‐
no, I mean the fifth one,

533
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,891
is representing the Holy Church.

534
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,227
His name is Kirei Kotomine.

535
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,020
He's from the Church?

536
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,024
He's the son of the overseer,
Father Risei Kotomine.

537
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,652
Reports say he studied
under Tokiomi Tohsaka

538
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,988
starting three years ago,
splitting with him

539
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,407
after his Command Seal appeared.

540
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,158
Did something happen?

541
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,453
This is his personal history.

542
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,456
Read it for yourself.

543
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,668
Kirei Kotomine followed
his father on pilgrimages

544
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,670
around the world
since childhood,

545
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,215
graduated from the St. Ignatius
School of Divinity in Manresa,

546
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,594
skipped two years,
graduated valedictorian.

547
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,554
He sounds pretty impressive.

548
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,599
But then suddenly, he
leaves the primrose path

549
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,976
and volunteers for
the Holy Church.

550
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,395
Why would someone like
that decide to work

551
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,981
for a secret
Church organization?

552
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,983
Maybe because of his father?

553
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,068
It says here that
Kotomine is a member

554
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,363
of the Holy Church's
Eighth Sacrament Assembly.

555
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,700
Then he would've pursued that
path from the very beginning.

556
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,412
But until he arrived at the
same place as his father,

557
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,081
he changed positions
three times.

558
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,710
At one time he was
even an inquisitor.

559
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,964
‐An inquisitor?
‐A heretic hunter.

560
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,635

561
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,512

short period of time.

During the same
general time periods,

he appeared in a
number of war zones,

567

but only when the combat
was at its fiercest.

568
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,030
It was almost as if
he had some obsession

569

with chasing his own death.

570
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:05,953

of mastery of a discipline,

absolutely nothing.

the one we're after,

702
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,774
will surely respond
to the summons,

703
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:55,028
the King of Knights,
Arthur Pendragon.

704
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:59,199
My own compatibility with
him is a secondary concern.

705
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,618
But Arthur, the
wielder of Excalibur,

706
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,870
is sure to be the strongest
Saber class servant

707
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,164

708
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,624
That's true.

709
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:11,419
I'll have a servant far stronger
than any other in the battle.

710
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,048
The question is, how
best to use that power?

711
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,300
How to make it work for us?

712
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,470
To be honest, in
terms of ease of use,

713
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,306
Caster or Assassin would
be far better suited

714
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,433

715
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,352
What good will it do
to worry about that

716
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,270
before you've even summoned him?

717
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,316
After all, we don't know what
the King of Knights was like,

718
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,945
and besides, no matter
what your strategy is,

719
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,615
once he learns of your
ideals, of your dream,

720

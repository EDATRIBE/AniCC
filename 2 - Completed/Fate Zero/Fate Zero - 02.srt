fresh terror and bloody death?

Okay, look, I don't know
anything about this Grail crap,

368

on, I am with you.

372
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,003
Ah‐‐the name is
Ryunosuke, correct?

373
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,131
What a magnificent
omen to be blessed

master like yourself.

Oh, hey, I didn't get your name.

What is it?

378
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,477
You wish to know my name.

379
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,479
Let me see now, in this era,

380
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,483
the most common name
for me would be, uh...

381
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,781
perhaps for now I'll
just call myself Bluebeard.

382
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,580
The church contacted me.

383
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,540
They said that
the seventh servant,

384
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,209
a caster has finally appeared.

385
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,296
The final servant
has been summoned?

386

Then it's time.

387
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,549
Indeed.

388
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,176
You are to leave here now,

389
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,888

to Tohsaka Manor.

390
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,307
And once I arrive?

391
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,142
The Manor is
surrounded by a number

393
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,731

child's play for you.

I was under the impression
that you were allies

397

with Tokiomi Tohsaka.

398

Don't you worry about that.

Even if it means you have
to engage Archer in battle,

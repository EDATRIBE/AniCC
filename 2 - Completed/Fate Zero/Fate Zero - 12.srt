had fulfilled all his missions
before he was destroyed.

183
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,896
What of the
matter we discussed?

184
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,564
You mean your interest
in learning the motives

185
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,567
of each Master for
desiring the Grail?

186
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,237
Yes, they completed
that investigation.

187
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,239
I should have had an
Assassin present the report

188
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,324
to you in person last night.

189
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,826
That would have
saved me the trouble

190
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:18,576
of having to‐‐

191
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,578
No, this is better.

192
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,541
I'm not interested in what
that walking shade has to say.

193
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,127
Kirei, this report
is meaningless to me

194
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,004
unless it comes
directly from your lips.

195
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,174
Hmm.

196
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,932
(car motor humming)

197
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,644
How does it feel
to drive a car, Saber?

198
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,770
Do you like it?

199
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,064
Yes, I think this is
a splendid vehicle.

200
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,774
I can not help but wonder
what would have happened

201
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,610
had these existed
back in my time.

202
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,405
Irisviel, are you certain
it is all right with you

203
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,906
that I drive this vehicle?

204
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,325
You seemed to thoroughly
enjoy the act of driving

205
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,578
when we were out
the other night.

206
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,662
No, this is fine.

207
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,289
If you're happy
driving the car

208
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,124
then I'm happy, too.

209
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,209
I have to say,
the skills of a Servant

210
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,919
are absolutely amazing.

211
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,547
This is your first time
touching this machine,

212
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,674
yet you're driving
it perfectly.

213
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,136
Oh, thank you, but I'm finding
the sensation somewhat odd.

214
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,637
It's like
I'm employing skills

215
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,972
I was taught
a long time ago

216
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,391
that were buried deep
within my memory.

217
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,226
Rather than understanding
it intellectually,

218
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,688
my body instinctively
knows what to do next.

219
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,691
(cars zooming)

220
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,485
Still, do you really
think this is a wise idea?

221
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,197
The estate that is to be
our new base of operations

222
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,116
lies precisely in the heart
of the main battlefield.

223
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,035
Don't you worry about that.

224
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,538
Because secrecy is the
hallmark of the Grail War,

225
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,832
the Tohsakas and Matous
have openly established

226
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,959
fortifications in the city.

227
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,337
The Einzberns are unusual
for building that castle

228
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,505
in such a distant location.

229
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,799
On the contrary, this
new base that Kiritsugu

230
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,760
has secured might
be more advantageous

231
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,511
than the castle
we'd been using

232
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,890
because its location is
unknown to the others.

233
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,271
(cars zooming)

234
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,065
(birds chirping)

235
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:18,196
It's another
very unusual building.

236
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:22,200
From now on, this place will
be your base of operations.

237
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,203
Ah, if you can take
those for me, Saber.

238
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,997
Yes, of course
I can, Irisviel.

239
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:36,047
Maiya, what does
this key open?

240
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,424
It appears quite
different from the others.

241
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,718
It's for the
storehouse in the yard.

242
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,887
It's fairly old,
but I've confirmed

243
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,806
that is is solidly built.

244
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,517
There was really no
time for preparations,

245
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:51,229
so this may be somewhat
lacking as a proper residence.

246
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,690
That's fine‐‐for now
so long as it keeps

247
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,567
us out of the rain,
that's sufficient.

248
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,907
(engine starting)

249
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,909
Now then, come on, Saber,

250
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,578
let's go and
explore our new place.

251
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,414
Yes, let's.

252
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,003
I think this is like one of
this country's haunted houses.

253
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,255
I'm sure all the hallways
have wooden floors

254
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,549
and the room's floors
are woven grass

255
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,927
with nice partitions
made of paper.

256
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,262
(giggle)

257
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,265
I told him once I wanted
to see a Japanese mansion.

258
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,727
Maybe Kiritsugu
remembered I said that.

259
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:45,116
Is our new base of operations
not what you expected?

260
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,535
No, it's not that,
I like it well enough,

261
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,872
but this isn't really an
ideal base for a mage.

262
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:54,292
There are a few things
that could be better.

263
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,544
The magical barriers
are well laid out,

264
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,254
but for a workshop it's‐‐

265
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,048
well, when it's this
open to the outside,

266
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,259
the magic has lots
of ways to leak out.

267
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,470
I would have preferred
a more secure room

268
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,805
walled off with
stone or clay.

269
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,356
Ah, this is ideal!

270
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,027
(footsteps echoing)

271
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,904
It's a bit small,

272
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,989
but I'm sure I can
craft my spells in here

273
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,909
just as well as I did
back at the castle.

274
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,993
Perfect.

275
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,536
Inscribing the
magic circle here

276
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,998
should be good enough
to make it my own.

277
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,834
All right then, let's
get started, shall we?

278
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,711
There's a lot
of work to do.

279
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,213
Will you help me, Saber?

280
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,215
We'll draw a magic
circle right there,

281
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,841
six feet in diameter.

282
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,592
Right.

283
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,676
I'll need your help most

284
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,970
once we start to
craft the mercury.

285
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,764
And don't worry,
I'll tell you exactly

286
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,432
how to do it.

287
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,226
Will you do me a favor?

288
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,519
Could you bring
in the ingredients

289
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,313
we left out in the trunk?

290
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,650
Irisviel, I must
ask you something.

291
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,901
It seems all day today,

292
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,736
you've acted as if
you've been carefully

293
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,364
avoiding touching anything.

294
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,658
Have I been imagining this?

295
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,619
Driving the car,
holding the keys.

296
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,912
Those matters by themselves

297
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,248
would not have
caused me to worry,

298
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,999
but now it is
beginning to appear

299
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,921
as if you're not even going
to handle your own magic.

300
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,298
If you were not
feeling well today,

301
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,218
it is important that
you tell me about it.

302
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,846
It is my duty to
ensure your safety

303
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,098
whenever it is necessary.

304
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:36,477
So I must know
if anything is wrong.

305
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,689
You're absolutely
right, I'm sorry.

306
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,773
I couldn't
keep this hidden

307
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,733
for very long anyway.

308
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,530
Your hand?

309
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,078
Saber, I'm going
to squeeze your hand

310
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:59,417
as hard as I can using all
the strength I can, okay?

311
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,253
All right, go ahead.

312
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,467
Irisviel?

313
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,595
Are you sure you
are not pretending.

314
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:14,932
I know it's weak, but this
is all I can do right now.

315
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,227
Just touching your fingers
is the most I can manage.

316
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,188
Grasping something
or picking it up

317
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,231
is beyond me.

318
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,109
Dressing this morning
was so difficult.

319
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,695
♪

320
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,489
But, but what is
the matter with you?

321
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,033
Have you been injured?

322
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,285
No, I'm just not
feeling too well.

323
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,913
So I've disabled
my sense of touch.

324
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,289
Just shutting down
one of my senses

325
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,125
allows me to control
my power quite a bit

326
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,585
and it means that
I can continue

327
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,171
to do everything
else I must.

328
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,839
Being able to
do things like this

329
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,926
is the specialty
of a homunculus.

330
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,304
But Irisviel, that simply can
not be all there is to it.

331
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,805
What exactly is
wrong with you?

332
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,891
Should you not
go see a doctor?

333
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,310
What if it's serious?

334
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,479
Perhaps you may
have forgotten, Saber,

335
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,649
but I am not in any way
a normal human being.

336
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,275
If I happen to catch a cold,

337
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,862
I can't even go to the clinic
like everyone else does.

338
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,531
I suppose you could
say my condition stems

339
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,326
from an inherent
flaw in my creation.

340
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,869
Don't worry about it.

341
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,247
Of course what this means is

342
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,665
I'm going to
need for you to do

343
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,833
a few things for me.

344
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,835
From now on, I'll need
you to drive the car

345
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,420
like you did today.

346
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,838
And you'll have
to help me set up

347
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,008
and perform my
magical rituals.

348
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,345
I'm sorry, but I'll
be depending on you,

349
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,847
my brave and gallant knight.

350
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,266
Yes, I'll help.

351
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,685
I apologize for
prying into the details

352
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,311
of your private life.

353
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,521
Forgive me.

354
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,022
It's really okay.

355
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,358
Now, why don't we get
started on that circle

356
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,110
before it gets too late.

357
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,444
If I rest in
a magic circle

358
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,697
that's connected
to local lay lines,

359
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,240
my condition will improve.

360
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,701
At least it should
start to a little bit.

361
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,994
Understood.

362
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,621
Then I shall retrieve
the materials right away.

363
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,421
With regards to Lancer's Master
and Ryder's Master,

364
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,381
they appear to have
no wish in particular

365
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,507
that they plan to ask for

366
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,135
should they happen
to win the Holy Grail.

367
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:18,222
They simply seek victory as
a means to win glory as mages.

368
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,058
Now then,
as for Caster's Master,

369
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,768
he seems to have
no real understanding

370
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,228
as to what the Grail is.

371
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,689
He is only taking part
in the Holy Grail War

372
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:31,027
as an extension of his
interest in killing for fun.

373
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,820
Regarding Berserker's Master,

374
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,656
he is immature and seeks
a measure of absolution

375
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,533
above all else.

376
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,911
For a time, he had severed all
ties with the Matou family,

377
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,080
yet he is now demanding
that the family set free

378
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,916
the younger Tohsaka
daughter whom they adopted.

379
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,002
She is currently being
groomed to be the next head

380
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,588
of the Matou
family in his place.

381
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,881
He has been given
the assignment

382
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,299
of winning
the Holy Grail

383
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,345
to secure his end of
a bargain for her release.

384
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,222
In addition, he appears
to have a past relationship

385
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,184
with Tohsaka's wife.

386
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,769
In a sense,
it might be said

387
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,396
that between all of the
five competing Masters,

388
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,606
he has the most unrefined

389
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,816
and banal motives
of them all.

390
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,570
What is it?

391
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,447
Continue, Kirei.

392
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,824
It's Saber's Master.

393
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,624
Hmm.

394
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,293
He is merely
a hired mercenary

395
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,753
retained by the Einzberns

396
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,296
to achieve their
long‐held dream

397
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,839
of attaining the Grail.

398
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,343
I was a fool to expect
more from him, hmm.

399
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,470
What an utter disappointment.

400
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,474
It seems he turned out
to be just another mongrel.

401
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,142
With dull and
stupid reasons

402
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,603
for seeking out and
stealing my treasure.

403
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,981
Exactly like all
the rest of them.

404
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,110
You cause me to go to all
that trouble investigating

405
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,986
and that is all
you have to say?

406
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,115
Think of those whose effort
has been wasted on you.

407
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,658
Wasted effort?

408
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,368
What wasted effort?

409
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,620
The work put in
by you and Assassin

410
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,373
has paid off
rather handsomely.

411
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,292
Are you mocking me,
King of Heroes?

412
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,752
Is that it?

413
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,003
You don't understand.

414
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,005
That's to be expected.

415
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,717
You are an obtuse man
who can not even recognize

416
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,176
his own joy.

417
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,096
Regardless of its self
awareness of this fact,

418
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,641
a soul instinctively
seeks out joy in its life.

419
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,685
This expression of the
soul appears in the form

420
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,062
of interest or appreciation.

421
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,481
Thus, Kirei,
having you tell me

422
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,066
what you've seen and heard

423
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,694
was of great interest
and importance to me.

424
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,697
And was very
instructive, indeed.

425
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,616
What you spoke about
at the greatest length

426
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:47,204
was what actually
interested you the most.

427
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,373
For now, let us
just set aside the man

428
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,959
you've deliberately
avoided speaking about.

429
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,921
A conscious interest is no
more than a simple obsession.

430
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,882
That being the case,

431
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,009
of the remaining
four Masters in the war,

432
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:04,805
of which one did you speak
about most passionately?

433
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,141
Berserker's Master.

434
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,727
Kariya, was it?

435
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,729
Kirei, when you
told me about him

436
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:16,984
you spoke of his
motivations in great detail.

437
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,236
His circumstances
are complicated.

438
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,572
Thus they required the
most detailed explanation

439
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,823
out of all of them.

440
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,158
Hmm, you are wrong.

441
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,201
He was the only one

442
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,161
you ordered Assassin
to investigate

443
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,412
to a thorough enough degree

444
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,582
such that you can understand
those circumstances.

445
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:37,338
And this was due to your
unconscious interest in him.

446
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,090
I accept that I made
an error in judgment.

447
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,801
It's true that
in the long term,

448
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,303
Kariya Matou
poses no threat.

449
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,138
He was not
worth the attention.

450
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,891
My overestimation
of his abilities

451
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,937
has invited your unnecessary
speculations about me.

452
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,438
Is that so?

453
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,565
Then imagine for me
a scenario in which

454
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,150
chance and fortune ensure

455
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,111
that Berserker and his Master
survive the many battles

456
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,781
and lasted until
the end of the war.

457
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,283
Can you imagine
what would happen then?

458
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,994
What do you think?

459
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,504
Listen, Kirei.

460
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,632
Is it not time that
you finally understood

461
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:25,427
the actual question
that I am asking you?

462
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,142
Tell me, Archer,
what could possibly be

463
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,813
the point in imagining
Kariya Matou's victory?

464
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:36,981
No point.

465
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,775
There is no point at all.

466
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,820
Come now, don't be
so angry with me.

467
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,572
Think about
it for a moment.

468
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,323
The fact that
Kirei Kotomine

469
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,117
never recognized
the futility

470
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,411
in such a speculation.

471
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,662
Do you not agree

472
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:57,042
there is a clear,
unshakable meaning here?

473
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,753
Explain for me, Archer.

474
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,963
It is like this.

475
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,798
If you had been given
the same question

476
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,009
but regarding
the other Masters,

477
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,511
you would have perceived
that there is no point to it

478
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:11,015
and you would have rejected
it as a waste of time.

479
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:14,894
However, that was not
how it went with Kariya.

480
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,521
For him, you abandoned
your usual sharp wits

481
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,066
and wasted your time
in pointless thought.

482
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,568
You ignored the futility

483
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,528
and the waste of effort,

484
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,032
you found enjoyment
in the exercise.

485
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:31,368
Celebrate, Kirei, you
have finally understood

486
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,121
what pleasure
is at long last.

487
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,583
Pleasure, are you
talking about joy?

488
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,336
Indeed.

489
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,213
There is nothing in
Kariya Matou's fate

490
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,925
that could bring
a man any joy.

491
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,552
His tortured life is nothing
but an endless string

492
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,512
of suffering and tragedy.

493
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,933
For him, a quick
and unexpected death

494
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,018
would actually
be a blessing.

495
00:23:56,018 --> 00:24:00,105
Kirei, why must you
define joy so narrowly?

496
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,900
Where is the paradox in
finding suffering and tragedy

497
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,319
simply other forms of joy?

498
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,655
There is no one
fixed type of joy.

499
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:10,908
You are confused because you
fail to understand that.

500
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,119
This is something that
can not be allowed!

501
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,666
King of Heroes, a sick and
human monster such as yourself

502
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,834
may find joy in
some small amount

503
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,419
of another's pain.

504
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,089
But that is the soul
of a Godless sinner!

505
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,675
An evil that
must be punished!

506
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,927
Thus, I have sworn
to follow the path

507
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,846
of pure faith in my life.

508
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:37,017
And so you have defined
joy itself as a sin.

509
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,937
It's astonishing to see
how far you've twisted it.

510
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,856
You never cease to be
a source of fascination.

511
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,274
Delightful.

512
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,277
(gasping)

513
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,280
This pain.

514
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,409
Aarrgh.

515
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,579
Ah, exactly as I expected.

516
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:01,000
I must admit that did
not take very long at all.

517
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,501
Impossible.

518
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,046
This can't be, no Servant has
been freed from their pact.

519
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,174
Why has the Holy Grail
chosen a new Master?

520
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,010
It appears that
the Holy Grail

521
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,347
still expects much more from
Kirei Kotomine in this war.

522
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,977
Kirei, you should go and
heed the Grail's summons.

523
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,396
Without a doubt, you
have some hidden reason

524
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,149
to seek this
mystical wish granter.

525
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,318
I have a reason
to seek the Grail?

526
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,739
If this wish granting
device is truly omnipotent,

527
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,824
then it can give
shape and substance

528
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:34,992
to the wish that lies

529
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,661
within the darkest
depths of your heart.

530
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,999
A wish of which
even you remain unaware.

531
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:45,753
So you claim that since
I do not know my desire,

532
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,588
I should use the
wish granting device

533
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,591
as a means to
learn what it is?

534
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,093
That can only happen
if I enter the war

535
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,386
as an independent mage

536
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,556
and systematically
crush six other wishes.

537
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,683
If I selfishly seek
possession of the Grail

538
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,268
for my own desires,

539
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:05,147
that means that I will
have ruthlessly betrayed

540
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,316
my own teacher and mentor.

541
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,943
Then you will need to have
a strong Servant on your side

542
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,195
to fight for you.

543
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,073
If you would seek to
do battle against me.

544
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,866
Of course
before any of that,

545
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,494
you must steal a new
Servant for yourself.

546
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,287
One already
summoned and controlled

547
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,831
by one of the other Masters.

548
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:28,796
In that case‐‐
no, I won't say it.

549
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:33,133
Everything from this point
forward is up to you.

550
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,969
Do it all exactly
as you desire.

551
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,014
That is the true
meaning of pleasure.

552
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,642
Pleasure leads to
the experience of joy.

553
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:45,395
And joy will lead
you to happiness.

554
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,398
Your path is
now clear, Kirei.

555
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:53,445
So clear there is no longer
any need to hesitate.

556
00:26:56,240 --> 00:28:23,994
♪

557
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,290
Then I shall
take the lead.

558
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,293
It's the perfect chance
to attack and put him down.

559
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,502
Let's finish this, Caster.

560
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,004
The whole world
is filled to the brim

561
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,589
with God's love, big guy.

562
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,007
And now once again,

563
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:41,011
we raise the blood‐soaked
flag of salvation!

Did you see that, Shirley?

373
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,198
I killed someone again,

374
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,868
just like I did with my dad.

375
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,454
I didn't screw up
like I did with you.

376
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:50,875
I saved an awful lot of lives.

377

If Natalia had landed
that plane safely,

378
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:58,215
there's no telling
how many people

379
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,967
might have died.

380
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:08,559
Her sacrifice
prevented all of that.

Shut your mouth.

387
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,285
Just shut up.

388
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,287
Bastard!

What a bad joke.

How does the life you
took from Sakura feel?

By my Command Seal,
I order you!

402

You look focused
just like you used to.

This is a battle

You know what,
I'm really happy.

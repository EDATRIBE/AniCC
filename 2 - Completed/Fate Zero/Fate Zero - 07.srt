that the Grail War
is in grave peril.

20
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,268
We have identified
Caster's master

21
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,438
as the person behind the
recent kidnappings in Fuyuki,

22
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,524
a disturbing
revelation, indeed.

23
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,985
Thus, in accordance with
the emergency powers

24
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,945
granted to me as overseer,

25
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:37,115
I am temporarily altering
the rules of the Grail War.

26
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,535
Masters are to hereby
cease all ongoing combat

27
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,828
in pursuit of the grail

28
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,624
and focus on the
elimination of Caster instead.

29
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,125
And the one who succeeds

30
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,336
in defeating Caster
and his master

31
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,840
will receive an additional
Command Seal as their reward.

These are the unused
Command Seals left behind

33
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,971
by the fallen masters
of past grail wars.

34
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,141
One of them should prove
to be of immeasurable value

35
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,394
to whoever receives it.

36
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,814
Once Caster's destruction
has been positively confirmed,

37
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,024
the Holy Grail War
will recommence

38
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,693

has questions,

40
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,489
please ask them now.

41
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,616
But, of course,
that offer is limited

42
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,245
to those who can actually
speak in human languages.

43
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,705

00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,834
Well played, Father.

45
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,086
Now all the masters
will do whatever they can

46
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,255
to hunt him down
and destroy him.

47
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,674
There were five familiars
gathered at the church

48
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,593
for my announcement,
which means that...

49
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,806
Which means that the elusive
missing master Lord El‐Melloi

50
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,850
is still very much alive.

51
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,892
Indeed.

52
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,062
And the offer of a
Command Seal as the reward

53
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,439
should draw him out

54
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,191
given that he's
already used one of his.

55
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,736
Of course, the other masters
will be drawn out as well.

56
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,698
They'll seek to keep the
Command Seal from the rest

57
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,535
by making certain they can
claim it for themselves.

58
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,871
That's true,
but it also means

59
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,664
that the master
who wins the seal

60
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,542
will gain a formidable
advantage over the others.

61
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,836
Naturally, it's not ideal.

62
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,297
Once Caster has been
thoroughly weakened

63
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,632
and is on the run from
all the other masters

64
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,884
who are chasing him,

65
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:23,263
Archer must be the one
to deal the final blow.

66
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,600
Um...

67
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,060
Excuse me, is this
the Mackenzie residence?

68
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,270
I have a delivery.

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,441
Yes, that is the name of
this domicile's residents.

70
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,069
Well, then, might there
be a Mr. Iskandar,

71
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,613
King of Conquerors here?

74
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,410
I should've known.

75
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,370
Uh, could I have

76
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,914

77
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,165
My signature?

78
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,375
Very well.

79
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,421

(laughing)

83
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:07,474
To have the entire world
emblazoned across my chest.

84
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,851
What a great feeling!

85
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,063
Wait, why are you
dressed like that?

86
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,524
The package I was
awaiting arrived.

87
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,734
So you went
outside the house?

88
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,653
Ta‐da, I merely tried out

89
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,613
that mail‐order
thing I heard about.

90
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,490
But I told you that
you were never to leave

91
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,491
the second floor!

92
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,201
If the residents
are not at home

93
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,786
and you are off
somewhere all day

94
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,621
occupied with your familiar,

95
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,873
who else is there
to answer the door?

96
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,291
I had no choice.

97
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,127
A summons to appear by the
Holy Church is a big deal

98
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,128
and I had to go.

99
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,922
Don't be so grouchy.

100
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,966
After seeing
Saber last night,

101
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,134
I came to a realization.

102
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,011
If one wears modern attire,

103
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,847
there should be no
issue whatsoever

104
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,266
with going outside
the domicile.

105
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,475
Hey, wait!

106
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,643
Stop!

107
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,938
At least put on some
pants before you go out!

108
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,482
Oh, yes, leggings.

109
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,859
That's true, I forgot.

110
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,570
Everyone in this
land wears them.

111
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,863
Do I have to wear them?

112
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,614
Yes, of course you have to!

113
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,241
And just to be
perfectly clear,

114
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,618
I'm definitely not going
to make a special trip

115
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,412
all the way to town
just to buy you a pair

116
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,706
of triple XL pants, understand?

117
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,957
You won't, why?

118
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,959
Boy, would you
actually stand in the way

119
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,169
of my triumphant
conquest of the world?

120
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,254
You conquering the world

121
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,006
and whether or not you
have pants have nothing,

122
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,592
not even the slightest
thing to do with each other!

123
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,511
Before you start planning to
go screwing around outside,

124
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,096
why don't you go out
and do your job

125
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,681
and beat one of the
other servants?

126
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,559
Then I'll buy your pants
or anything else you want.

127
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,768
Very well.

128
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,186
I understand.

129
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,063
Do you swear
that once I defeat

130
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,398
one of the other servants

131
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,234
you will go and buy me
a modern pair of pants

132
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,028
so that I can go outside?

133
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,654
Unbelievable.

134
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,656
You really want to
put on modern clothes

135
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,533
and go walking
outside that much?

136
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,161
The King of Knights was
walking around outside.

137
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,372
I simply cannot allow
myself to be undone.

138
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,499
I like the design
on this shirt.

139
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,377
It is fitting attire
for a strong ruler.

140
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,131
Look, we have to go find
and defeat Caster too.

141
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,592
What the hell are we doing?

142
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,097
There is a powerful
barrier over Mount Enzo

143
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,433
with Ryuudou Temple
at its center.

144
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,561
Because of that, except for
natural spirits like servants,

145
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,231
anything can enter only
via the temple path.

146
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,193
Keep that in mind as
you're using Saber.

147
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,945
There are three other spots
where the ley lines converge:

148
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,781
Tohsaka Manor, Fuyuki Chapel,

149
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:32,077
and this new residential area,
east of the city center.

150
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,205
Consequently, this means
that there are four locations

151
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,957
in Fuyuki that have all the
spiritual characteristics

152
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,377
needed for the
grail to appear.

153
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,045
In the war's second phase,

154
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,756
when there are fewer
servants left in the fight,

155
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,925
we'll have to secure
one of these spots

156
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,135
as our base of
operations, won't we?

157
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,345
Yes, that's correct.

158
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,181
Well, that just about
covers the lay of the land.

159
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,100
Are there any questions?

160
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,477
Is there anything that
you aren't clear on?

161
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,688
I understand perfectly.

162
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,565
It was an adequate
explanation.

163
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,568
Kiritsugu, can we assume
that all the other masters

164
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,362
will go after Caster?

165
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,114
It's a safe bet.

166
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,990
However, we have an advantage

167
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,451
as far as Caster
is concerned.

168
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,245
In his madness,

169
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,040
he believes that our Saber
is actually his Jeanne d'Arc

170
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,792
which is to our benefit.

171
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,586
We need only wait
for him to come to us.

172
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,797
But, master,
that is not enough.

173
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,882
His evil deeds
must be punished.

174
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,843
We should take the
fight straight to him

175
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,263
before he can do
any more damage.

176
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,640
♪

177
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,684
Iri, do you have a handle

178
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,436
on this forest's
barrier spells?

179
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,438
Yes, I do, however,

180
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,815
our real problem is
the unbreakable curse

181
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,900

(sobbing)

26
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,459
Dear Ryuunosuke,
only a very select few

27
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,837
can fully comprehend
the immense importance

28
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,131
of true beauty and harmony.

29
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,551
To the vast majority
of common ignorant philistines,

30
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,137
beauty is but something
to be loathed and feared

31
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,055
and destroyed.

32
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,724
It is for that very reason
that we mustn't become

33
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,644
excessively attached
to our creations.

34
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,105
All things given form
and substance are destined

35
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,482
to one day break
and fade away.

36
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,484
It is therefore
absolutely essential

37
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,070
that we find joy in
the process of creation

38
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,197
instead of the creation itself.

39
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,033
So, whatever they break,
we should just make another?

40
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,034
Is that it?

41
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,619
Precisely so!

42
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,788
As always, my dear Ryuunosuke,

43
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,915
your understanding
of important matters

44
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,460
is your best virtue.

45
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,920
(sniffling)

46
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:21,803
Maybe we were just having
way too much fun and so God

47
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,473
decided to punish us?

48
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:28,769
Listen carefully to what
I say to you now, Ryuunosuke!

49
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,062
God does not punish humans ever!

50
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,523
He simply toys
with them, cruelly.

51
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,192
B‐‐big guy?

52
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:39,154
Once, long ago, I committed
spectacular atrocities

53
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,407
the likes of which
this Earth had never imagined.

54
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,910
Day after day,
I murdered and defiled,

55
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,413
yet no divine punishment
rained down on me.

56
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,957
Before I knew it,
eight years had passed

57
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,251
and my exploration
into the depths of evil

58
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,045
had been ignored.

59
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,048
In the end, it was not
God that destroyed me

60
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,424
and took away my life,

61
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,011
but rather the selfishness
of my fellow Man.

62
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,013
The church and the
state executed me,

63
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,265
not for anything wrong
that I had done,

64
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,768
but because they coveted
my wealth and my land

65
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,854
and wanted to take them from me
and make them their own!

66
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,898
What brought an end
to my evil deeds

67
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,274
was far from judgment;

68
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,361
it was simple theft
by a pack of criminals!

69
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,824
Uh, yeah, but, big guy.

70
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,160
There's‐‐there's
still a God, right?

71
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,373
Why ever would you think that?

72
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,959
You, who are without faith
and have never in your life

73
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,335
known a miracle.

74
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,338
Because the world
seems like it's so boring.

75
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,049
But then, the more you look,
the more you find all kinds

76
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,677
of neat and crazy
stuff around you!

77
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,554
I've always thought that way.

78
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,931
A world filled with so many
wondrous and amazing things

79
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,643
like this could never
have happened simply by chance.

80
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,687
If you set your mind
to enjoying it,

81
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,732
there's no better entertainment
than this unbelievable world!

82
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,901
I'm sure there's
a master entertainer

83
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,571
somewhere writing the story
of all five billion people

84
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,822
in this world.

85
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,658
If you wanted to describe
somebody like that,

86
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,618
what other name
could you possibly

87
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,662
call Him but God Himself?

88
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:14,708
Then, Ryuunosuke, do you
believe that it's possible

89
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,710
God loves humanity?

90
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,711
What do you mean?

91
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,004
He's head over heels.

92
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,007
I mean, if He's spending
every minute of every day

93
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,593
writing our story,
well, He could never do it

94
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,553
if He didn't love us.

95
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,639
In fact, I'll bet you
He's totally into it,

96
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,602
along with totally enjoying
the results of His own work.

97
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,271
He also loves all the things
that make humans look good,

98
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,023
like honor, courage, and hope,

99
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,526
and at the very same time,
He loves screams and blood

100
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,737
and utter despair just as much.

101
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,697
If He didn't,
there's just no way in Hell

102
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,991
the guts of living things
would be as cool and colorful

103

104

the whole world

105
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,955

with God's love, big guy.

106
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,667
In this era of faithlessness
when the state has completely

107
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,503
abandoned the true will of God,

108
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,131
I had no idea that such
a vivacious new faith

109
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,509
had taken root and was
beginning to bear amazing fruit.

110

You have my admiration,
Ryuunosuke, my dear master.

111

Cut it out,
I'm starting to blush.

112

Ah, yes, here you are.

181
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,094
You know, you're so tiny,
you're impossible to see

182
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,012
between these bookshelves.

183
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,056
It was difficult to find you.

184
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,101
Normal people are smaller
than bookshelves, idiot.

185
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,269
Man!

186
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,563
So, what is it you bought?

187
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,772
Feast your eyes!

188
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,650
It just so happens that
the new Admirable Grand Strategy

189
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,777
videogame came out today.

190
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,113
First‐run, limited edition!

191
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,239
(laughs)

192
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,617
I suppose my luck must
be pretty good today.

193
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,288
You know, there's no
point is buying software

194
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,790
when you don't even
have a game console.

195
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,793
Yes, I took care of that.

196
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,338
Come on, boy, let's go
play in two player mode!

197
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,465
I bought us each a controller.

198
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,553
I'm not interested in low‐class
entertainment like that.

199
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,430
It's stupid.

200
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,890
What's wrong with you?

201
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,392
Why are you constantly trying
to narrow your own horizons

202
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,270
instead of broadening them
to the fullest you can?

203
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,024
Don't you ever get the desire
to seek out something fun?

204
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,317
Shut up.

205
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,485
If I had spare time
to waste on that,

206
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,654
I'd spend it all on a search
for truth rather than‐‐

207
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,657
So, what was it you found
so interesting on this shelf

208
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,534
over here?

209
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,994
Was it this one?

210
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,750
Well, I'll be,
this is a book about me!

211
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,586
You are a strange boy,

212
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,297
I am right here in
front of you every day.

213
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,717
If you wanna know
something, just ask me.

214
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:02,430
All right, fine then,
I'll ask you!

215
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,682
According to the description
of this history book,

216
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,310
you were really short back
when you were first alive.

217
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,648
So, how come you materialized
here in such an enormous body?

218
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,817
Huh, it says that I was tiny?

219
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,654
I've always believed
that you should never

220
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,573
completely trust what's written
in a book when you don't know

221
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,116
the person who wrote it.

222
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,744
(hearty laughter)

223
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,287
Wait a minute,
you mean to tell me

224
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,706
you're not mad
they got it all wrong?

225
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,502
Huh, no, it doesn't
really bother me.

226
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,836
That's strange.

227
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,381
Throughout history,
the people in charge

228
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,717
have always tried their hardest
to make sure future generations

229
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,552
remember them.

230
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,390
I suppose having your name
recorded in the history books

231
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,351
is a kind of noble immortality.

232
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,229
But if that means my name
and nothing else gets passed

233
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,898
down for two millennia,
I would have preferred

234
00:12:53,898 --> 00:13:00,029
to have...even a hundredth
of that added to my life.

235
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,699
So, then...it's true
that you died in

236
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,409
your early 30s?

237
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,204
Hmm, yes, that one's true.

238
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,163
Oh.

239
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,919
Hey, big guy!

240
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,299
Get going out there
and show us some cool gig

241
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,594
that's gonna shock
even God, okay?!

242
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,556
You may look forward
to it, Ryuunosuke!

243
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:30,810
It will be the greatest "cool!"
you have ever seen in your life!

244
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,936
Seriously?

245
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:36,107
All right, I can't
wait to see it!

246
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,526
Uh.

247
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,779
(chanting)

248
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,533
(roaring winds)

249
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,620
Oh, yeah, something
really awesome

250
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,956
is gonna happen here,
I just know it!

251
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,805
Hey, why are you
being so quiet, boy?

252
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,098
Hmm?

253
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,352
It's nothing, I was
just thinking about

254
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,313
how boring you are.

255
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,773
What, you were?

256
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,317
See, you are bored,
just as I thought.

257
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,070
Just quit whining
and play this game with me.

258
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,072
That's not it!

259
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,074
You see, with a servant like you

260
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:30,036
who's practically
guaranteed to win,

261
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,830
I couldn't take pride
in winning the grail.

262
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,665
It would have been a lot
better for both of us

263
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,377
if my pact had been with
Assassin instead of you!

264
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,090
Mmm, I don't think that would
have worked out for you at all.

265
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,009
I think by now,
you'd be deceased.

266
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,344
Well, that's fine!

267
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,262
If I'm going to die
fighting in my own battle,

268
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,972
I'm not going to complain!

269
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,726
That's the reason why
I decided to join the Grail War,

270
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,144
and now...

271
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,147
I really don't know
what to tell you, boy.

272
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,066
If the wish you have
for the Holy Grail

273
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,528
was something that impressed me
in some form or manner,

274
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,697
I would be far more inclined
to enthusiastically obey

275
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:10,034
your every whim and desire.

276
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,745
But if all you want it for
is to add a few centimeters

277
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,539
to your diminutive stature‐‐

278
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,041
You have no idea
what you're talking about!

279
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,418
You don't need to be
in such a hurry.

280
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,170
Nobody said that
the Holy Grail War

281
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,172
would be the single
most important event

282
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,382
of your entire life.

283
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,842
There will be others.

284
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,052
What?

285
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,387
When the day finally arrives

286
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,765
that you find a way to live
that you can truly be proud of,

287
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,184
you'll be forced into
your own grand battle,

288
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:39,438
one that you will have to fight
whether you want to or not.

289
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,858
You will have plenty
of time, then,

290
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,901
to look for your battlefield.

291
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,654
I'm saying that I'm not
the only one here

292
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,157
who isn't satisfied
with this pact.

293
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,116
Mmm?

294
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,702
You don't like it
any more than I do, right?

295
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,580
Having me as your
sworn master, I mean.

296
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,623
You'd have been able
to win this war easier

297
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,250
if only you'd sworn
your allegiance to

298
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,419
a different master, right?

299
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,962
(sighs)

300
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
Probably, yes.

301
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:16,184
♪

302
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,310
Take a look, boy.

303
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,564
You see, you're looking at
the real enemy that I'm facing.

304
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,317
Now, try to draw
a picture of the two of us

305
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,236
standing alongside this enemy.

306
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,615
Draw it so you can tell
the difference in our sizes.

307
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,158
Wait, what do you mean, that's‐‐

308
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,784
Impossible, right?

309
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,495
Compared to the enemy
that we're about to take on,

310
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,957
you and I are the same,
just little dots.

311
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,169
What point is there
in trying to compare our sizes?

312
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,215
That is exactly why I'm excited!

313
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,843
The weakest and the smallest;
that's just perfect!

314
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,179
With a body tinier
than a poppy seed,

315
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,141
I will someday overtake and
even surpass the entire world!

316
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,268
Nothing can ever stop my quest,

317
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,646
for in my chest beats
the invincible heart

318
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,106
of the King of Conquerors!

319
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,943
So, what you're saying
is who your master is

320
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,403
makes no difference.

321
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:13,199
No matter how weak I am,
it really doesn't matter

322
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,909
one way or the other to you?

323
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,329
Now, where did you
get that stupid idea?

324
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,455
(grunts)

325
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,792
That miserable complaining
nature of yours is a sign

326
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,419
that somewhere
inside you is a conqueror.

327
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,672
No matter what you
want me to believe,

328
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,008
you are acutely aware
of how small you are

329
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,927
and yet, in spite of that,

330
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,512
you still struggle
to reach heights

331
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,515
greater than you could
ever begin to imagine.

332
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,977
It's not a compliment;
you're making fun of me.

333
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,061
Indeed, boy.

334
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,983
Face it, you are a stubborn
and incorrigible idiot.

335
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,444
Your deepest desires
are far greater than yourself.

336
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,614
Like they say, glory lies
beyond the horizon.

337
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,283
Back in the world
that I lived in,

338
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,910
that was the fundamental
rule of a full life.

339
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,621
Is that why you kept rushing
towards the east all the time

340
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,373
like some kind of idiot?

341
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,208
Of course, that's right!

342
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,379
I wanted to see Okeanos
with my own eyes, but, alas,

343
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,048
my glorious dream
was never realized.

344
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,758
Huh?

345
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,387
You never saw the ocean
like in my dream?

346
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,599
Even now, boy,
Okeanos remains

347
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,726
the place I strive for.

348
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,312
It is a never‐ending dream.

349
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,023
That sea in my dream
was really an image

350
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,318
of the heart that Rider
has been dreaming.

351
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,694
Laugh if you like.

352
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,697
I, who after 2,000 years
still dream the same dream

353
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,741

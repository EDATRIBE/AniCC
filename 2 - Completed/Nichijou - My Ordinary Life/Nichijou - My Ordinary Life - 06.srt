00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,208
Sorry it took a while!

00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,916
I present to you the
Yuuko special! Here.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,750
Whoa! Your twice-cooked
pork looks delicious!

4
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,708
And great timing too!
I was getting pretty hangry.

5
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,125
I made sure to throw in a dash
of my secret ingredient.

6
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,708
I wonder if you'll guess it.

7
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,791
You must've gone all-out if you
put your secret ingredient in.

8
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,916
Thanks for all the food!

9
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:43,083
[MIO] Oh. That's the
overpowering burst of miso.

10
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,916
It's so not subtle at all,
not even a little bit.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,833
No, yeah, that's
all I'm getting.

12
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,000
Not much of a
"secret" ingredient.

13
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,333
Ugh, now it's starting to taste
worse the longer I chew.

14
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,500
You know what?

15
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,375
This is one secret I
wish I didn't know!

[YUUKO]
Hey, Mio! Check it out!

20
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,000
Uh.

22

[MIO]
The heck is this?

23
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,250
A kappa? Why would she show
me her weirdo drawing?

24
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,791
And does she really think
this thing looks good?

25
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,416
[MIO]
But you know.

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
I do like the idea of drawing
some sort of mythical

27
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,416
or fantasy-themed story.

28
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,333
Like this kappa and a
<i>daidarabotchi</i> or something.

29
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,333
Kappa, hmm.

30
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,791
He'd be the bottom.

31
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,041

32
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,125

33
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,166
Huh?

34

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,958

00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,583
Heh. Might as well turn
this into one of those

Cool, thanks.

40
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,750
[YUUKO]
A parasite?


41
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:40,416
Is that what a parasite
is supposed to look like?

42
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,916
Wait, does this little arrow
mean what I think it means?

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,166
She's challenging me to a
word-chain game with pictures!

44
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,000
[YUUKO]
Well, I accept your challenge!

45
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,666
Let's see, parasite.

Got it!

48
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,833
[MIO] It's huge! What is
that even supposed be?

49
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,375
A tengu maybe?
Sure, let's go with that.

50
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,583
[MIO]
Whatever.

51
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,458
Tengu it is. Now, what
starts with a "G-U"?

52
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,875
Guh... Goo...

53
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:15,791
Gah! Are you kidding me? <i>Tengo</i> ?

54
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,708
What the heck is
a "tengo" anyway?!

55
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,500
Wait! Hold on a sec!

56
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,125
This has to be
on purpose, right?

57
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,500
There's no way
someone could make

58
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,291
such a basic spelling mistake.

59
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,541
Then again, it is Yuuko, so
we're kinda grading on a curve.

60
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,541
I don't get her at all.

61
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:35,250
It doesn't make any sense,
but I just have to move on.

62
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,041
Starting with "G-O," huh?

63
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,791
[MIO]
Here.

64
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:47,791
[YUUKO] Oh. Whoa, what's with
the sensual-looking dude?

65
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,041
Wait. Goku?

66
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:54,041
But the last thing I drew on my
turn was a tengu, wasn't it?

67
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,750
Oh well, I guess it
was an honest mistake.

68
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,750
It could happen to
anybody, so I'll let it slide.

69
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,875
I'll give her crap
about it later.

70
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,166
Let's see.

71
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,166
So, the next one can
start with a "U." 'Kay!

72
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,791
[MIO]
Uh...

73
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,875
[MIO]
An eel? Wait, rabbit?

74
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,250
It's a cow? That looks
udderly terrible!

[YUUKO]
Ohh! A tongue?

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,291
So that's how we're playing!

79
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,583
So, "shita" would
end it a "T-A."

80
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,458
Then how 'bout Taxi.

81
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,250
Huh? Ah! What the hell?

82
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,250
You cannot be serious right now!

83
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,750
How hard is it to spell Taxi?!

84
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:56,041

I'll keep playing along.

keep me on my toes!

Okay, I see you.

88
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,333
Oh. Oh, crap!
This ends with an "N"!

Stupid rules.

00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,250
Okay. Quick fix.

351
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,083
[screaming]

352
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,125
[YUUKO]
Uh.

353
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,041
[screaming]

354
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,416
[MIO]
Huh?

355
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,083
[MIO screams]

356
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,041
[MIO]
I'm so sorry, Mai!

357
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,250
[YUUKO] We screwed up the rice
and curry, so there's no lunch!

358
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,125
Are you mad at us?

359
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,708
At least we still
have these noodles.

360
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,833
[BOTH gasping]
You're a life saver!

361
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,375
[MAI]
Be free.

362
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,958
[YUUKO]
So, uh. Here's our lunch.

363
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,583
One serving of jelly noodles.

364
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,375
We only brought one pack?!

365
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,666
I was thinking we could ration
it out evenly with each other.

366
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,875
But because you and I were
the ones who ruined the lunch,

367
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,958
Mai gets first dibs.

368
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,541
[BOTH]
Rock, paper, scissors!

369
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,541
[YUUKO]
Boo-yah!

370
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,833
You better not try
anything funny

371
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,500
and eat the entire
thing by yourself!

372
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:20,208
Oh, calm down. I would never
do anything mean like that.

373
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:24,625
Now then, it's time
for me to dig in!

374
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,250
[coughing]

375
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,250
[sighs] Down the wrong pipe.

376
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,791
[MIO grunts]

377
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,916
[MIO yells]

378
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,875
[YUUKO groans]

379
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:47,541
[MIO, YUUKO grunting]

380
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,041
[MIO yelling]

381
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,250
[MIO, YUUKO yelling]

382
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,291
[MIO, YUUKO]
Grumble...

383
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,500
[MIO]
Grumble.

384
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,583
[YUUKO]
Grumble.

385
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,500
--[MIO] Grumble.
--[YUUKO] Grumble.

386
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,875
I know! How 'bout we
play some cards!

387
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,291
[MIO]
How 'bout not!

388
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,833
[YUUKO] At this rate, the entire
trip is gonna be a bust,

389
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,791
so we might as well
try and have some fun

390
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,125
playing games and
end on a high note!

391
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,708
I got it!

392
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,333
Oh, yeah? What'cha got?

393
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,708
[MIO laughs]
I was just thinking,

394
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,041
when adults get sad and bored,

395
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,500
they like to break
out the drinks!

396
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:27,625
I guess that's true!

397
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,791
Mai! Am I right, or am I right?

398
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,375
I came prepared. One sec.

399
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,375
Whoa, that's super hardcore.

400
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,500
[laughs] Yeah, you bet I am!

401
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,000
Watch out! We got
a badass over here!

402
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,416
Ta-da!

403
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,125
[gasping]

404
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,708
[BOTH whimpering]

405
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,041
[MIO]
Ugh! I don't care!

406
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,125
I'm gonna chug it!

407
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,833
[YUUKO]
Don't do it! You'll die, I bet!

408
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:58,083
Maybe Mai can share
whatever she has left!

409
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,375
[MIO, YUUKO]
Huh?

410
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,416
Oh, this? It's cider.

411
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,625
[footsteps]

412
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,458
[DOG grunts]

413
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,958
[BOTH]
Ah!

414
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:58,625
[WORD-TIME NARRATOR] Out from
the bath, have some milk.

415
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,666
Pretend that you're drunk.

416
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,791
[CURRENCY]
I'm Peso!

417
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:04,958
Ten-Yen here!

418
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,875
I'm Wado-kaichin!

419
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,583
Remember! Just because
you're currency,

420
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:09,708
doesn't mean you're current!

421
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,458
[CURRENCY laughs]

422
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:14,291
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 7.

423
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,541
Look forward to it!

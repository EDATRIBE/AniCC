1
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,625
[YUUKO] I bet she's a total
master at mental math!

2
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:15,666
Who's a what now?

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,166
Nano, the transfer student.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,208
[MIO]
Hm?

5
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,958
A robot like her would
have a calculator function

6
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,208
or something, right?

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,750
What're you talkin' about?

8
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,750
There's no way that
she's a robot.

9
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:29,958
[YUUKO]
Come on, it's so obvious

10
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,666
with that thing
sticking out of her!

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,041
Huh? The key in her back is
your only piece of evidence?

12
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,125
You're jumping to conclusions.

13
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,083
Hang on! Just hear
me out on this one.

14
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,916
If she is a robot...

15
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:43,916
...that'd be dope!

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,958
And it'd also be off the chain!

17
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,625
I have no idea what that means,
but you're sure excited.

18
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,541
I think I'm gonna officially
start investigating

19
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,500
to see if Nano is
a for-real robot.

20
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,666
Hold on! Isn't that
going too far?

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,000
It's no prob!

22
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,375
I've come up with
a foolproof plan!

23
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,958
[YUUKO]
Oh, Nano?

24
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:30,791
[NANO gasps]

25
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:31,708
Yes?

26
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:32,916
[YUUKO snickers]

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,125
Question for ya.

28
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,333
[NANO]
Hm?

29
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:39,541
What's 3,260 plus 260,
then divided by 320?

30
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,500
[NANO gasps]

31
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:46,750
Well, uh, if I were to follow
the order of operations, uh...

32
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,541
It sure is a thinker.

33
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,583
[YUUKO coughs]

34
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,166
Maybe you should
calculate this one.

35
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,416
[coughing]

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,458
[MIO] You're kidding me!
That was your big idea?

37
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,416
That's a toughie.

38
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,333
If you don't mind, I'd like
to use something special.

39
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,583
[YUUKO]
A bite!

40
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,208
[BOTH]
The line snapped!

41
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,791
'Kay, first things first.

42
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,250
I'll need to start by wiping
the slate completely clean.

43
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,500
[BOTH]
She's legit using it!

44
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,500
[NANO]
Here goes. One, two, three.

45
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,666
[YUUKO, MIO]
She's like... like a...

46
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,791
...like a... She's
a like, a total newb!

47
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,708
[NANO]
All right, take 3,260 and...

48
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,750
[BOTH] What happened
to using the abacus?

49
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,458
[MIO]
Wha--?! Hey, pull it together!

50
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,166
[NANO gasps]

51
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,166
What happened to her?

52
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,208
[MIO]
How you holdin' up?

53
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,541
Don't worry 'bout me.

54
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,208
I just crumbled under the
weight of my ambitions.

55
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,541
I told you right from the get-go

56
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,666
that she wasn't a
robot girl, didn't I?

57
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,875
Any way I can help?
I could offer you a drink?

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,291
[YUUKO] This is it!
It's the sacred chalice!

59
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,791
[YUUKO]
Could it be? Show me the oil!

60
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,875
[YUUKO]
What a soup-prise!

61
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,708
Yuuko!

62
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,583
Oh, guess not. Huh?

63
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,000
Hey there.

64
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,625
[MAI]
Here.

65
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,333
[YUUKO]
She threw a fastball!

66
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,750
[MIO]
Oil?

67
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,500
For you.

68
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,291
Oh! That's so nice.

69
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,833
I appreciate the gesture.

70
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,125
[BOTH gasp]

71
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,041
[YUUKO]
Strike!

72
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,958
You can have this, too.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,750
[YUUKO]
Curveball!

74
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,625
[MIO]
A monkey wrench?!

75
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,375
Wow, thanks a bunch.
I needed one of these.

76
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,291
[YUUKO]
To eat?

77
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,208
Another strike!

78
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,625
[MIO groans]

79
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,083
[MIO]
All right, you two.

80
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,708
I think now's a good time
to chill the heck out.

81
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,875
Can't you see that
she's uncomfortable?

82
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,458
It's skinship.

83
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, we just wanted
to be friends with you.

84
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,083
[MIO]
Seriously?

85
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,291
There's no way
she'll be your friend

86
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,791
if you keep freaking
her out like that!

87
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:06,833
[YUUKO]
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,500
[MIO]
That's better.

89
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,000
Hey! I'm not bothered,
so don't worry.

90
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,583
[MIO]
Huh? You sure?

91
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,833
Oh. That's right! The soup!

92
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,666
I'll help myself if
no one else wants it.

93
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,083
[YUUKO]
Would you look at that?

94
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,250
I guess things
are all good then!

95
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,125
[MIO]
She's obviously...

96
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,416
[NANO]
Did I lose a tooth?

97
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,125
[MIO] If you try putting
yourself in her shoes,

98
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,708
how would you feel?

99
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,458
[MIO]
Cut it out already.

100
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,583
[NANO gasps]

101
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,041
[NAKAMURA]
I need to know.

102
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:09,000
How did such a highly advanced
technology come to be?

103
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,250
That transfer student
who just started here

104
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,250
has a strange demeanor.

105
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,833
In addition to that bizarre key.

106
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,708
Well, no matter how
you slice it,

107
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:22,000
she absolutely has
to be a robot.

108
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,833
Why was such an innovative
piece of tech being kept secret?

109
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,500
And why is she attending our
plain little high school,

110
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,875
of all places?

111
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,125
I want to know. I need to know.

112
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,958
For science.

113
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:39,291
Once I do, that robot
will be mine.

114
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,958
Oh!

115
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,208
Pardon the intrusion,
but I brought the textbooks

116
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,250
you asked me to get,
Ms. Nakamura.

117
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,375
[NAKAMURA]
She came!

118
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,791
Now I must act, posthaste!

119
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,500
All done! If you'll
excuse me, I'll be going.

120
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,416
[NAKAMURA]
One moment, Miss Shinonome!

121
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,875
So, uh, would you like a cup
of coffee before you go?

122
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,541
Huh? No! I would hate
to be a bother!

123
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,750
Oh, come on. Don't be
such a stick in the mud.

124
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,000
You can think of this
as a "thank you."

125
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,166
Here, I just brewed
a fresh beaker.

126
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,916
Get it while it's hot.

127
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,916
One cup won't hurt me.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,208
[NAKAMURA]
Let's see what happens

129
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,916
if I add a little something
to calm her down.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,750
Way down.

131
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,166
For science, of course.

132
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,333
If there are no results,

133
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,416
I'll resort to my trusty
Mr. Short Circuit.

134
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,833
Again, for science.

135
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,166
[NAKAMURA]
Here ya go.

136
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,916
Thanks so much.
It smells really good!

137
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,375
[NAKAMURA grunting]

138
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,500
[NAKAMURA]
Why'd I drink it?

139
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,583
[NAKAMURA]
Fight it.

140
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,416
Hang in there!

141
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,750
[NANO] Well, uh,
I'm gonna head out now.

142
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,750
[NAKAMURA]
Wait, come back.

143
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:10,125
I need to study you...
for science.

144
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,208
Hey. Did ya hear?

145
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,083
Ms. Nakamura the science
teacher passed out.

146
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,291
Oh, wow, she sure does
that a lot, doesn't she?

147
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,250
[BOY F]
Rawr! Rawr!

148
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,125
[BOY G yells]

149
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,375
[sighs]

150
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,500
[NANO]
Today was pretty stressful.

151
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,625
There were one too
many close calls,

152
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,708
but my classmates
seem really nice.

153
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,333
I hope we can all
be friends someday.

154
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,125
[BOY F]
Take this!

155
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,583
Rocket punch!

156
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,250
Ka-boom!

157
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,583
[BOY F yelling]

158
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,875
[BOY G]
Taste my robot's maximum power!

159
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,541
[sighs]

160
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,791
--[BOY F yells]
--[BOY G] Ha-ha!

161
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,291
[NANO]
Hakase! Hakase!

162
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,083
Ah, Nano! Good to have you back!

163
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,375
Ah, Nano! Good to have you back!

164
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,750
Huh...? Why did you just
say the same thing twice?

165
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,333
Know what, never mind
that for right now!

166
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,958
I wanted to ask you to
take this key off of me!

167
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,000
Uhh... But why?

168
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,166
What do you mean "why"?

169
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,416
It's negatively impacting
my school life!

170
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,583
I can never sit back
properly in my chair.

171
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,000
Students look at me weird
and one even filmed me!

172
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,625
I've been able to get by so far,

173
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,083
but I don't know
if that'll last.

174
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,708
Ahh.

175
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,416
That key's so cute though.

176
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,875
But can't you see that as long
as I have it stuck on my back,

00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,458

treat me like a normal girl?

that I'm not cute

that robots aren't cute.

00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,083
in my daily school activities!

348
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,875
We did the high jump
in gym class today,

349
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,875
and I could only
belly roll over it!

350
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,625
And during soccer,
I got put on the bench

351
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,458
because I fouled
a kid with my key.

352
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,083
Okay. I can take it.

353
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,375
[NANO]
Splat!

354
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,625
If you were so willing,
you should've told me earlier.

355
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,500
I gotcha. I'll take it
right now if you want.

356
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,208
Not a day goes by
that I don't wish

357
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,875
to have this thing off my body.

358
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,333
But now, I can finally
start my new life

359
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,458
as a normal high school girl!

360
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,666
If you don't mind,

361
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,666
I'd like to get this
key taken right away.

362
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,083
[HAKASE]
Cheese.

363
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,750
Hakase? Don't tell me you're--

364
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,916
I took it.

365
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,208
[NANO]
Plop!

366
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,041
I feel betrayed.

367
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,375
Why?

368
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,916
I thought you meant you
were gonna remove my key,

369
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,500
not take a picture of it!

370
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,833
Oops, my bad.

371
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,000
So, are you ever gonna
take off my key for real?

372
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,291
Let's see.

373
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:15,500
Hmm...

374
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,500
[NANO]
Kapow!

375
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,916
I've had it up to here
with your silly gags!

376
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,958
Will you do it?
Or will you not do it?

377
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,541
Calm down. I can do it!

378
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,458
I've taken more than my fair
share of keys in my life.

379
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,416
So taking one more key like
yours is gonna be a snap.

380
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,125
[NANO]
Coin, coin, coin, swish!

381
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,458
[laughs]

382
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,916
Wow! I can't believe you
just went "coin, coin"!

383
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,500
And then flew away like "swish!"

384
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,458
Hakase! I have a
question for you!

385
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,250
[HAKASE]
Lemme catch my breath.

386
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,875
I was laughing so hard
I forgot how to breathe.

387
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,041
Listen, I can't help but
notice that I'm making

388
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,166
some pretty strange
reactions today.

389
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,875
You didn't, you know,
do something to me,

390
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,416
did you now?

391
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,583
Well, actually, I gave you a
funny bone feature yesterday!

392
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,500
[NANO]
Shibibi! Shibibi!

393
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,458
Shibibi! Shibibi!

394
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,500
Why would you give me such a
bizarre and obnoxious feature?

395
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,541
What is even the
point of it anyway?

396
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,125
I thought it would be funny.

397
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,666
[NANO]
Thump!

398
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,291
Goal!

399
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,583
[NANO]
Dodododo!

400
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,916
--[HAKASE] Mwah!
--[NANO] Bang!

401
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,291
[NANO]
This is it.

402
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,291
This is how I'm gonna die
and it's gonna be awful.

403
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,791
See how much fun we're having?

404
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,250
I'm not having any fun!

405
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,125
All right then.

406
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,458
Forget about the key for a sec

407
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,875
and please just remove
this funny bone feature.

408
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,291
That'll be a hundred yen.

409
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,958
[NANO]
Boom!

410
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:32,750
[WORD-TIME NARRATOR] This takes
every last ounce of my strength.

411
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,791
[OIL]
I'm oil.

412
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,916
People say I'm slippery,
but I can't really blame them!

413
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That's just who I am.

414
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,250
My boss pours me all the time,

415
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,583
but you're not the boss
of me, so hands off!

416
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,625
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 16.

417
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,041
Look forward to it!

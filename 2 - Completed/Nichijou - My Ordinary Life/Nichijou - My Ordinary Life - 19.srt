What the heck?

348
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,583
I kinda just started this
little club on a whim.

349
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,541
But now...

350
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,458
...it's gotten crazier
than I could've imagined!

351
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,250
[sighs]

352
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,250
Huh?

353
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,083
Huh?

354
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,500
[WORD-TIME NARRATOR] I break
down when no one can see me.

355
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,000
[CLAY] Step on me all you'd
like, but I'll never break!

356
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,750
That's right, it's me, Clay!

357
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,416
I can be molded into anything!

358
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,750
But today, I shall take the form

359
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,416
best suited to
battle the children!

360
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,333
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 20!

361
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,958
All right, kids, bring it on!

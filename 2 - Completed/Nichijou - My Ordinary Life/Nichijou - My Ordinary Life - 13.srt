00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,541
[SAKAMOTO]
Man, I'm starving.

2
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,166
Oh?

3
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,625
Well, that's subtle.

4
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,750
Don't these kids have
anything better to do?

5
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,250
Whatever.

6
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,208
There's a fish in it for me,
so I guess I'll get trapped.

7
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,875
Seems pretty harmless.

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,125
[screams]

9
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,291
[laughing]

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,791
I gotchu! Kitty fell for it!

11
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,833
[SAKAMOTO]
Nope. Not harmless.

12
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,250
Harmful.

13
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,958
[NANO]
Huh?

14
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,750
I was gonna cook this up
for lunch in a little bit.

15
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,208
Now I hafta go out
and buy something else.

16
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,541
What a bad boy.

17
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,166
[SAKAMOTO]
Don't you blame this on me!

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,416
[HAKASE]
But why not?

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,208
You're the one who said
you wanted to eat it.

20
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,250
[SAKAMOTO] I did not!
When did I ever say that?

21
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,583
[HAKASE]
You ate it, didn't you?

22
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,791
Can you believe how
hot it is today?

23
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,083
[GIRL A]
Ugh. I know, right?

24
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,875
[GIRL C] Wanna grab some
ice cream after school?

25
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,708
[GIRL B] Oh, yeah! For sure!
I could totally go for that.

26
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,916
[GIRL A]
That sounds perfect!

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,708
There's a new spot I wanna try.

28
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,625
[GIRL C laughs]

29
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,875
[SAKAMOTO]
Hey, kid.

30
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,208
It looks like she
wants to go to school.

31
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,333
[HAKASE gasps]

32
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,416
[HAKASE]
You can't go!

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Where's this coming
from all of a sudden?

34
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,666
Nano, why are you leaving me?

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,000
What?

36
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,833
Who in the world told you
I was gonna leave you?

37
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,333
Him.

38
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,208
[SAKAMOTO] That's not even
remotely close to what I said!

39
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,500
So then, are you still gonna go?

40
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,541
Well, I am planning
on going to the store,

41
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,833
if that's what you mean.

42
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,500
There's just a few things
I need to pick up

43
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:48,958
so I can make us some lunch.

44
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,500
[gasps]

45
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,166
[HAKASE] I want go to
the store with you!

46
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,500
I'm not buying you any snacks.

47
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,416
I want the shark chocolate!

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Not happening.

49
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,875
[HAKASE]
Come on! It's only chocolate!

50
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,500
I already told you no.

51
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,291
[HAKASE] Just one!
That's like almost nothing!

52
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,416
[NANO]
It's still something.

53
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,166
[HAKASE]
Actually, Sakamoto wants it.

54
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,166
[SAKAMOTO]
Don't drag me into this!

55
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,708
[YUUKO]
Hey, it's Mio. Morning.

56
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,625
Ah! What's wrong with your face?

57
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,375
You look awful!

58
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,708
Now you mention, I didn't
been feel not very good.

59
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,916
So, yeah...

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,250
[MIO]
Oh, man.

61
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,458
You can't even form a
proper sentence right now.

62
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,250
And that fever looks real bad.

63
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,000
Why didn't you just stay at home
if you're feeling this sick?

64
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,583
I couldn't 'cause...

65
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,791
I told you, I gotta show
you those magic tricks.

66
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,541
Remember? The secret ones.

67
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,958
[YUUKO chuckles]

68
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:16,083
What magic tricks?
You never told me about them.

69
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,916
Hey! Just forget about the
tricks and go back home to rest!

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,708
But I spent so much time
practicing my magic.

71
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,875
I guarantee you,
it'll be so worth it.

72
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,833
Just sit back and be
prepared to be amazed.

73
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:28,500
It's gonna be--

74
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,708
[YUUKO gags, coughs]

75
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,416
[MIO]
I'm amazed you came to school.

76
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,583
Why don't you take it easy?

77
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,625
[yelps]

78
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,291
[MIO]
Yuuko!

79
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:41,541
Your prop... is already
migrating out of your bag!

80
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,291
[MIO] I'll just pretend I didn't
see it and act surprised later.

81
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,541
Otherwise she would've dragged
herself out here for nothing.

82
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,875
But I don't get it.

83
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,583
Why is she trying so
hard to show off her...?

84
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,791
[YUUKO groans]

85
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,000
[MIO] Bird! It's totally
out in the open now!

86
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,166
Her props are on the loose!

87
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,208
[MIO gasps]

88
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,458
[MIO]
It flew away!

89
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,708
My tissues.

00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,625

[gasps]

94
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,541
'Kay, so I'm gonna
start the show now.

95
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,500
Sure. Go ahead!

96
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,416
[MIO] Great, what do
I do with this thing?

97
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,708
I just hid it on instinct.

98
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,458
[YUUKO]
All right.

99
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,541
First we have... I have, uh...

100
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,250
[MIO]
She's really out of it.

101
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:46,125
She hasn't even noticed that her
dove and wand are missing.

102
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:50,083
First, I'll pass a cigarette
through this ordinary coin.

103
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:55,541
[MIO] This is pathetic.
I can already see the hole!

104
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,750
[MIO] Every card in the deck
is an ace of hearts!

105
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,291
Now what?

106
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,250
[MIO]
Hang on.

107
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,083
Something just flew
out of her mouth.

108
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,375
With her gross sneeze.

109
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,250
[gasps]

110
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:38,125
[MIO] I don't understand.
What were you planning?

111
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,166
[gasps] Yuuko!

112
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,791
[MIO]
And she's out.

113
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,208
[MIO]
Rest in peace. Or whatevs.

114
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,791
[NANO] 'Kay, I'm heading
to the supermarket now.

115
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,875
Great! I'm gonna go, too!

116
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,791
[NANO] That's fine, but I'm
not getting you anything

117
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,375
since you were misbehaving.

118
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,458
Ya hear that? Too bad for you!

119
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,708
[SAKAMOTO]
She's not talking to me!

120
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on. Let's go to the store.

121
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,875
[HAKASE]
So, what are you gonna get?

122
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,416
[NANO] Well, I was
thinking another fish.

123
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,666
I wonder what kind of
snack I should buy.

124
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,750
I said I wasn't buying
you anything.

125
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,875
Huh? But what if I
wanted a not snack?

126
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,833
It doesn't matter, you're
not getting any food.

127
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,500
[NANO]
Huh?

128
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,875
In that case, what's left
at the grocery store

129
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,583
that I can buy? Anything?

130
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,500
[NANO] You're not gonna
let this go, are you?

131
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,375
[HAKASE] Whoa! Check it out!
It's a shark castella!

132
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,375
[NANO]
Oh, they put a food stall here?

133
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,833
That dessert looks
super tasty, right?

134
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,083
Hey, don't try anything funny.

135
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,541
I've made up my mind.

136
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,208
Aww. But what if it
was for Sakamoto?

137
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,708
Would that be okay?

138
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,666
Sakamoto misbehaved, too,
so he's in the same boat as you.

139
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,291
Oh, did I say it
was for Sakamoto?

140
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,875
I meant it was for you.

141
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,875
Nope, it's not gonna happen.

142
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,166
[NANO]
If I'm not firm with her,

143
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,375
she's just gonna end up spoiled.

144
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,958
All right, come along.

145
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,750

Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

151
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,416
[NANO]
I really shouldn't. Should I?

152
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,000
[HAKASE] Buy it!
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

153
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,791
[NANO]
I definitely can't!

154
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,958
But what if I did?

155
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,416
[HAKASE] Buy it! Buy it!
Buy it! Buy it...

156
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,000
[NANO] No! Absolutely not!
Maybe one snack?

157
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,333
[HAKASE]
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

158
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,791
[NANO]
Ugh! There's no way!

159
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:43,708

00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,250

Buy it! Buy it! Buy it--

00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,083
So yummy!

00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,500

Really? You ended up caving?

163
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,750
I'm sorry. She's persuasive.

00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,958
[SAKAMOTO] This little brat
can just throw a tantrum

165

and ends up getting
whatever she wants.

166
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,708

her a lesson.

you have any self-control?

348
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,708
--[SAKAMOTO groans]
--[HAKASE snickering]

349
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,666
[gasps]

350
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,500
But, Hakase, I can't carry
a bag with this key on, so...

351
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,791
Yes, you can.

352
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,208
Just hear me out.

353
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,500
If you take the key off of
my back, then I can, uh...

354
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,500
[chuckles]

355
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,708
[HAKASE]
You like your school uniform?

356
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,375
I love you, Hakase!

357
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,500
Nano, Nano, Nano,
Nano, Nano, Nano!

358
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,333
Hakase, Hakase, Hakase,
Hakase, Hakase, Hakase!

359
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,541
[HAKASE] Nano, Nano,
Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano!

360
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,125
[NANO] Hakase, Hakase, Hakase,
Hakase, Hakase, Hakase!

361
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,250
[HAKASE] Nano, Nano,
Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano!

362
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,708
[NANO] Hakase, Hakase, Hakase,
Hakase, Hakase, Hakase!

363
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,125
--[HAKASE] Nano! Nano!
--[NANO] Hakase! Hakase!

364
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:51,875
[HAKASE]
Nano, Nano!

365
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:52,958
[NANO]
Hakase, Hakase!

366
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:53,708
[HAKASE]
Nano!

367
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,625
[NANO]
Hakase!

368
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,083
[HAKASE]
Nano, Nano!

369
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,166
[FLAG A]
I'm national flags!

370
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,125
People wonder if I'm a string
of international flags,

371
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,791
or the flags of many nations,
but I'm actually both!

372
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,291
"Don't sweat the small stuff."

373
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,416
That's the last thing my
father ever said to me.

374
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,291
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 14.

375
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,791
Look forward to it!

Oh, yeah, don't worry.

It's cool. See you!

00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,833
Hey, Mai, do you wanna
walk home together?

5
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,875
Can we stop by the fire station?

6
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,375
Stop by what?

7
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,833
Why would a pair of ordinary
high school girls go there?

8
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,041
[YUUKO]
I know what we can do!

9
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,125
How 'bout we go and visit

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,041
that Daiku Coffee place
on the way home.

11
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,791
But their sizing system
is kinda weird,

12
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,416
so don't feel too bad
if you get confused

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,958
by the names and stuff.

14
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,500
Got 'em.

15
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,541
I've been there before, so I
can help walk you through it.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,625
Mai. Something's... afoot.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,166
I'm stepping up my game.

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,000
Uh, yeah, I can see that!
I just can't understand why!

19
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,916
Is this some sort of fashion
statement or what?

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,875
It's just a joke.

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,916
[YUUKO] She really threw
me for a loop there.

22
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,000
[YUUKO] It's happened.
Mai's completely lost her mind.

23
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,458
I don't even know
what to say anymore!

24
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,541
[YUUKO] Oh, well. I'll just
see what happens, I guess.

25
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,833
[NANO] I wonder... What I should
make for dinner tonight?

26
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,208
[NANO]
Green onions are on sale today,

27
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,083
so maybe I can do
something with those.

28
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,958
Wait, no. Hakase hates onions.

Caught a what?

34
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,416
Wait! You can't bring
that in here!

35
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,541
It's dangerous, and it might
carry diseases or something!

36
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,125
Nah. It's fine.

37
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,291

It's not in here either.

Greetings. I am Crow.

48
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,291
I'm so surprised by how polite
and considerate he is.

00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,291
Well, yeah, he's a crow.

50
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,583
[CROW] You are too kind.
It is an honor.

51
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,625
[HAKASE] Do you think crows
can drink strawberry juice?

52
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,041
Huh. Good question.

53
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,958
[HAKASE] We should try
giving him some! It'll be neat!

He's nice enough to
kill bugs for us!

58
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,708
It was nothing. I simply
did what I felt was right.

00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,916
What happened to that scarf
you always wear, Sakamoto?

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,833

Ah, yes. I see.

69
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,791
It appears he's upset because
he would like to wear my scarf.

Ah, I see.

71
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,708
[SAKAMOTO] It's my scarf
in the first place!

72
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,333
Hakase, did you take
your scarf invention

73
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,708
from Sakamoto and put
it on the nice crow?

74

[HAKASE chuckles]

75
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,541
This is quite a predicament.

Did you stop to think about how
that might make Sakamoto feel?

I know! I'll make him something!

What exactly is this "Biscuit

If you don't do it, then I'll
tell everybody in school

175
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,125
that you have a thing for her,

176
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,625
and it'll get real
awkward for you.

177
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,083
Uh! Blackmail?

178
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,916
[MAKOTO] How 'bout it?
Sounds like a good deal to me.

179
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,208
Well.

180
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,625
[MAKOTO]
What's it gonna be?

181
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:16,083
It's just, being a club advisor,
it's kind of a hassle.

182
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,208
[MAKOTO]
Hey, everyone!

183
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,500
You'll never believe
what I found out!

184
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,625
[TAKASAKI] He's doing it?
I have to stop him!

185
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,125
There you are!

186
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,458
Nakanojou fell into a hole
filled with glue behind the gym

187
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,666
and now he can't get out!

188
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,916
[TAKASAKI]
Wha--?!

189
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,708
[ANNAKA] We need your
help, like, right now!

190
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,625
[MAKOTO] Hey! Who wants to hear
some dirt on Mr. Takasaki?

191
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,708
[ANNAKA]
Sir!

192
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,375
[TAKASAKI]
All right, then. Listen closely.

193
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,416
[ANNAKA]
Okay.

194
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,875
[TAKASAKI]
Nakanojou...

195
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:45,958
...is totally okay!

196
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,125
[ANNAKA]
Wha--?!

197
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,625
Maybe he's pretending
to be a golf ball!

198
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,125
[ANNAKA]
Wha--?!

199
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,958
So is that why somebody shaved
all of his hair off, then?

200
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,333
[TAKASAKI]
Wha--?! Draw it in.

201
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,916
[ANNAKA]
Wha--?! I can try.

202
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,250
[TAKASAKI]
Wha--?!  Hang on!

203
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,416
[ANNAKA]
Wha--?!

204
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,083
First help me with this!

205
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,375
[MAKOTO]
He likes green tea.

206
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,875
Stopping a student
from blabbing about

207
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,791
a teacher's private life
is just as important

208
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,250
as a student that
needs to be excavated!

209
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,916
Because, well, I'm a teacher!

210
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,125
Mr. Takasaki!

211
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:11,833
[TAKASAKI]
What?!

212
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,666
I kept my mouth shut!

213
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,833
I'll be waiting for you,
club advisor.

214
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,958
That's a good call, my dude.

215
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,083
Annaka, let's bounce!

216
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,250
'Kay!

217
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,125
[TAKASAKI]
There's no time to waste.

218
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,958
After all, I'm a teacher!

219
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,333
[ANNAKA]
It's this way!

220
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,916
[TAKASAKI]
One sec.

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,125
[NAKAMURA] Even though I always
thought his hair was weird,

222
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,083
I do feel kinda bad
for shaving it off.

223
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,833
So...

224
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,708
I guess I should dig him out.

225
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,708
He doesn't know I set the
trap in the first place,

226
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,500
so it should be fine.

227
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,750
[TAKASAKI]
What's this? What's going on?

228
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,041
Where am I?

229
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,666
This feels weird! I don't
like it! I'm stuck!

230
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,291

[YUUKO]
This is it.

254
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,333
I won't call out
Mai's jokes today!

255
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,250
[YUUKO] It's like she's
practically begging me

256
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,625
to make jabs at her.

257
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,125
She just lobs 'em up,
and I can't stop myself

258
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,208
from knocking 'em
out of the park!

259
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,541
[YUUKO]
But if I don't cut it out now,

260
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:36,916
we're gonna get stuck in some
weird, never-ending joke cycle!

261
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,875
We're just normal
high school girls

living our ordinary

At least we're supposed to be.

But the way we act is
anything but ordinary.

that's all gonna change.

her A game today!

And now's my chance to start
an ordinary conversation.

00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,416
Oh, yeah, I was wondering:

280
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,125
Did you see yesterday's
Muscle Theater show?

281
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,041
[YUUKO] Wha--? Wait,
am I supposed to choose?

282
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:37,791
Where are my glasses?

283
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,375
[YUUKO screams]

284
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,958
[YUUKO] It's just one gag after
another with her today!

285
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,625
And the more I ignore them,
the more she does it!

286
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,458
But I can't give in!
I have to stay strong!

287
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,958
Don't take the bait!

288
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,041
What's up with you, Mai?

289
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,333
You've got two pairs
of glasses on!

290
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,958
[YUUKO] How dare you, Tanaka!
I wanted to call her out!

291
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,958
The one thing in this
world that I wanted

292
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,375
and you took it away from me!

293
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,750
Ah! Wait! No,
this is a good thing!

294
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,958
It might just help me
not make fun of her!

295
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,291
Wait, hold on.

296
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,916
What class do we have
for first period today?

297
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,125
[YUUKO]
No idea!

298
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,625
But did you hear that
Ms. Nakamura tripped

299
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,500
and fell the other day?

300
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,458
No. I hope she's okay.

301
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,833
Wait, hold on.

00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,083
[YUUKO]
Shut your mouth, me!

00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,041
That was so sneaky,
I almost didn't notice!

And nobody even
called her out on it!

Now then, who would like
to read this section?

00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,041
[NANO]
Hm?

345
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,375
Wake up, Hakase.
You shouldn't sleep here.

346
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,791
You should crawl into bed or
you might catch a cold, okay?

347
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,333
Are you listening to me?

348
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,833
Gimme a little longer.

349
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:29,750
Huh? Longer for what?

350
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,125
That's what!

351
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:16,166
Sakamoto, you should really
go to your bed, too, y'know.

352
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,958
[SAKAMOTO]
Uh. Sure.

353
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:24,625
[WORD-TIME NARRATOR] In the end,
she had to be carried.

354
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,666
[SPADE]
I'm the three of spades!

355
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,875
My number may be low,
but don't count me out!

356
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,500
The deck may be stacked
against me, too,

357
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:34,041
but that's not a deal breaker!

358
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,625
This spade is my
strong suit, after all!

359
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:39,708
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 18!

360
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,000
Look forward to it!

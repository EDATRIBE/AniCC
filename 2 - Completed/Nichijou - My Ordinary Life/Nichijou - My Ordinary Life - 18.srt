00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,291
[YUUKO]
I'm telling ya,

2
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,250
Daiku Coffee is pretty great
after that remodel they did.

3
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,958
[MIO]
Really?

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,666
[YUUKO]
See? Check it out!

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,875
[MIO]
You weren't kidding.

6
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,541
It's like a real café now.

7
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,041
[TAMAMURA]
Welcome!

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,791
[YUUKO]
I've already been here,

9
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,875
but take as long as you need to
figure out their menu and order.

10
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,708
[MIO]
Oh, really? Okay.

11
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,916
[YUUKO chuckles]

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,666
Yeah, lemme get a white
chocolate mochaccino

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,500
in a grande, please.

14
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,000
[YUUKO]
Huh?

15
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,625
[MIO] And if it's not too much
trouble, can I get it with

16
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,333
caramel sauce, hazelnut syrup,
extra whip, chocolate chips,

17
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,458
and an additional shot of
espresso, affogato style?

18
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:53,708
[YUUKO]
Screw this!

19
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,333
[MIO]
Wait! Where are you going?

20
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,416
[NAKAMURA] My previous attempts
at researching Nano Shinonome

21
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,625
were unsuccessful.

22
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,291
But luckily, I have a plan!

23
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,125
Now with double the
oxidizing strength,

24
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,500
unleashing the power of oxygen,

25
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,208
it'll make my tough problems
disappear like magic!

26
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,416
It's Mr. Oxidation Plus!

27
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,250
With this, I'll finally have
my chance to study that girl!

28
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,583
For the sake of science!

29
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,666
I don't even know what
I wanna study first!

30
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,000
There are so many options.

31
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,333
Maybe I'll start--

32
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,291
[OOGO]
See what you can muster!

33
00:02:56,375 --> 00:03:00,500
[NANO]
Oh, no. What do I do?

34
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,416
Whoa. I guess we're working with
these compass things today.

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,708
It looks like you're pretty
excited to get started, huh?

36
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,500
Uh, sure!

37
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,916
[MIO]
Hey, guys!

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,666
Today's class is
a study hall now.

39
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,458
[YUUKO]
Yeah! All right!

40
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,333
I wonder if it's because
Ms. Nakamura collapsed again.

41
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,958
[YUUKO] She sure does fall
over a lot, doesn't she?

42
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,250
[NANO sighs]

43
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,166
[MISATO]
Hey, Sasahara!

44
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,375
You're supposed to
be on cleaning duty!

45
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,333
I completed the sweeping
responsibilities assigned to me.

46
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,250
Uh! But you left a pile
of crap on the floor!

47
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,416
[KOUJIROU]
Hm. Did I really?

48
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,291
[MISATO] Go back downstairs
and finish it up!

49
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,416
I'm curious as to how you
knew that you would be able

50
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,541
to find me on the roof.

51
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,958
[gasps]

52
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,916
Don't be stupid!

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,416
It's a nice day so I came
to enjoy the warm weather,

54
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,916
and you just happened
to be up here, okay?

55
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,375
I see.

56
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,416
Sorry for troubling you.

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,250
I appreciate you always
looking out for me.

58
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,458
[KOUJIROU]
Hm.

59
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,375
[MISATO] Don't you dare
take it the wrong way!

60
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,875
It's not like I did it
for you or anything!

61
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,416
[KOUJIROU]
Wow.

62
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,416
[NANO, MIO gasp]

63
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,833
[YUUKO]
It's my day off!

64
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,500
I've got plans to meet up with
Mai in the next town over.

65
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,833
She said that there would be
free candy involved if I came,

66
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,708
so how could I say no?

67
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,666
[WOMAN A]
Want some bread?

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,583
Oh, no thank you, it's fine.
I ate earlier, so--

69
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:57,083
[YUUKO] I thought dogs were
like, not allowed on trains.

70
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:00,791
[YUUKO]
Here.

71
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,958
I'm quite all right.

72
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,083
Look, my stop is coming up,

73
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,041
so I better hop out of my seat
right now and get ready to go!

74
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,083
[YUUKO yelps]

75
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,958
[ANNOUNCER A] The next stop
is Tokisadametonyamachi.

76
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,791
[YUUKO]
Good call, Mr. Announcer man!

77
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,791
[ANNOUNCER A] We've now arrived
at Tokisadametonyamachi...

78
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,083
[YUUKO]
Perfect. Get me off this thing.

79
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,250
So long train-riding
people. Yuuko out.

80
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,375
[YUUKO]
This is fine!

81
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,375
I'm just taking longer
for dramatic effect!

82
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:41,875
[chuckling]

83
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,083
[YUUKO]
I gotta keep my cool!

84
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,958
Once I'm off the train,
this'll all be over!

85
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,750
I'm so sorry! I wasn't looking
where I was going and--

86
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,666
[screams]

87
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,458
[YUUKO]
Come on! Don't sweat it!

88
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,708
I'm in the next town over,

89
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,500
and it's practically a
different country here!

90
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,625
I'll never see any of these
people ever again,

91
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,833
so it's totally fine!

92
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,916
[YUUKO] Is it just me
or am I being followed?

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,666
I'm just imagining things!

94
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,333
It's pro'bly 'cause I'm still
flustered from earlier.

95
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,291
Things will be fine
if I focus on getting

96
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,833
to the Daiku Burger place.

97
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,000
Where ever that is.

98
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,625
Well, according to the
map Mai gave me...

99
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,750
...this thing is
nothing but treble.

100
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,541
I'll just ask for
directions. Yeah.

101
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,666
'Scuse me, but do you know how

102
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,791
to get to Daiku
Burger from here?

103
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,541
Ah! Okay! That's it! You better
stop following me around

104
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,416
or I'm gonna report you for
breaking some sort of law!

105
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,750
I'm sure I can find one!

106
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,291
I heard you're looking for
the Daiku Burger nearby.

107
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,833
I'm actually meeting
somebody there,

108
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,291
so I can show you the way
if you need some help.

109
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,625
[EMPLOYEE A]
Welcome!

110
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,791
[YUUKO]
Hm?

111
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,458
[MIHOSHI]
Sorry, Sis. Club ran long today.

112
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,708
You're late!

113
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,750
[YUUKO] Looks like she
was telling the truth.

114
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,416
[EMPLOYEE A]
Thank you for your patience!

115
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:04,333
[YUUKO] I don't see Mai,
so I guess she isn't here yet.

116
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,000
[YUUKO]
Aw, man.

117
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:11,958
This has been a day, and
it's barely even started!

118
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,333
Oh, well. At least
I'm in a different city.

119
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,166
Yeah! I just need to
look at the bright side!

120
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,500
I'll learn from what
happened here,

121
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,500
so I can be prepared
for when it matters!

122
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,750
That's right!

123
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,458
If I can survive this
level of humiliation,

124
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,166
I can take on anything
the world throws at me!

125
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,625
[MAI]
Yuuko.

126
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,833
Sorry I'm late.

127
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:32,000
Wait, what? Is that
what I think it is?

128
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,750
[MAI]
Trick or treat.

129
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,208
[YUUKO] I'm already in this
deep. Might as well commit.

130
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,833
I'm all in!

131
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,291
Trick or treat to you, too.

132
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,750
Don't they know
Halloween was last week?

00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,833

Crow"! Check it out!

[CROW A cawing]

00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:59,875
[YUUKO growling]

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,208
I'm not sleepy enough
to sleep right now.

137
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,750
[SAKAMOTO] You could always
try counting sheep

138
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,958
in your imagination.

139
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,916
I've heard that helps.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,166
Okay, I'll try
counting sheepies.

141
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,250
One sheepy jumping over a fen--

142
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,000
[SAKAMOTO]
She fell asleep after one?

143
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,458
Wow, that really works!

144
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,833
Let me try!

145
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,250
One fluffy sheepy--

146
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,000
[SAKAMOTO] That sheepy
never made it over.

147
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,750
There ya go.

148
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,916
Thanks a lot!
You're the best, sis.

149
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,291
Hey, so does that
Sasahara guy teach you

150
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,041
how to do stuff like this?

151
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,291
What makes you
think that?! Huh?

152
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,750
Why would I ever go to a guy
like that to teach me anything?

153
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,250
I just thought you
two seemed close, so--

154
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,833
Well, we're not close,
like, at all!

155
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,583
And don't you dare think
that we are! You got it?

156
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,583
[MIHOSHI]
Uh, sis, you're scaring me.

157
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,750
But if you two aren't close,

158
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,500
then why did you iron
his handkerchief?

159
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,708
Uh, that was just something
I found on the ground

160
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,250
and wanted to fix up a little.

161
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,375
[MIHOSHI]
Did you wanna make it nice

162
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,291
because it was Sasahara's?

163
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,291
Yeah, right.
I would never do that.

164
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,333
I felt like practicing my
ironing, and the iron

165
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,083
just so happened to be
out and ready to use

166
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,875
and the handkerchief I
found also just happened

167
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,750
to be sitting underneath it.

168
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,208
I guess.

169
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,791
Yeah! It was just circumstance!

170
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,416
[MIHOSHI]
Dang. She's so transparent.

171
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,583
[MIHOSHI] That doesn't explain

ironing something you
found on the street.

There's a simple
explanation for that!

174
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,125
It... was because...

175
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,208
It's because the Earth must've
entered the Photon Belt

176
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,458
at that moment and
reality shifted.

00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,833
[GIRL A] I finally talked
to Oono yesterday!

Wow! Really?

181
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:13,375
[WOMAN B] Two hours by train.
And one hour by bus.

182
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,125
[WOMAN B] I left behind
the hustle of city life.

183
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,833
In its place, I now
have the peacefulness

184
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,208
of S Town's countryside.

I searched for so long,

186
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,041
never thinking for a moment
that I would actually be able

187
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,791
to find it again.

188
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,458
Yet I never wavered.

189
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:45,416
I continued my quest for
that one special book.

190
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,083
It brought a spark of color and
excitement into my heart

191
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,000
when I was a child.

192
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:54,583
Coloring the gray,
uneventful days of my youth.

This is the place. The library.

196
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,916
to bring me and
this book together.

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,333

Um, but I've already
seen this one before.

As my name implies,
I run solely on biscuits.

Biscuits are like fuel.
They give me life.

a biscuit at once!

I can speed read also.

you always read so slow?!

Now what seems to be
the problem, Biscuit #2?

Looking at all of
these tiny letters

00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,875
I can't believe 4 failed.

345
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,541
Hey, you doin' all right?

346
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,625
I'm up next.

347
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,958
Huh? Wait, aren't
you the quiz guy?

348
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,500
[SOLDIER #6]
I'm so screwed.

349
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,458
But I don't have a choice.
The quiz game's all I've got.

350
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,625
But if I make it easy enough,

351
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,666
maybe it'll appease the princess
and I won't fall to my doom.

352
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,875
It'll be fine.

353
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,791
As long as she gets
the answers right...

354
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,916
I'll just give her simple,
easy-to-solve questions.

355
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:23,125
[SOLDIER #6] Uh, #6! And I'm
here to give you a quiz!

356
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,666
Can you name something that has

357
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,333
the word "bread" in it
but is also inedible?

358
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,791
Uh, it's a multiple
choice question!

359
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,416
Uh, The first option
is breadbox

360
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,083
and the second option
is melon bread!

361
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,666
[SOLDIERS]
Wow, that's easy!

362
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,875
Ah!

363
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,250
[grunting]

364
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:46,958
I give up.

365
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,250
[SOLDIERS gasp]

366
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,500
That is... the correct
secret answer!

367
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,333
[SOLDIER #6] My whole life,
I regretted nothing.

368
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:01,500
[SOLDIER #6]
Except this!

369
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,083
We're so dead.

370
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,208
Even the quiz master
was sent packing.

371
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,125
[STARLA]
Next.

372
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,791
[SOLDIER #7]
Um, I'm #7!

373
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,583
And I can recite every location
the Olympics have ever taken--

374
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,000
[SOLDIER #7 screaming]

375
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,958
[SOLDIER #8] We'll never
forget your courage, #7.

376
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,750
What's the matter?

377
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,583
Is no one here capable of
entertaining the princess?

378
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,250
[SOLDIER #8]
What am I gonna do?

379
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,291
And here I thought a
cheerleading routine

380
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,291
would be a good idea.

381
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,583
[SOLDIER #0]
Speak for yourself!

382
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,125
I was splitting chopsticks
with my butt cheeks!

383
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,916
[SOLDIER #39] I was gonna
dance with a sushi mat!

384
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,166
[SOLDIER #91] I thought I'd
be cool to shred a cabbage!

385
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,750
[ALL groan]

386
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:44,208
[SOLDIER #8] We're all doomed.
Every last one of us.

387
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,166
Relax.

388
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,541
You didn't forget that you
have me around, did ya?

389
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,916
Wait! You're the--

390
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,333
His harlequin antics have made
him the best clown in town.

391
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,583
There's nobody funnier
than this guy.

392
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,000
He's... Harlequeen 13!

393
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,875
I'll turn those
frowns upside-down

394
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,208
and put on an unforgettable
show in the process.

395
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:08,833
Boom!

396
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,333
Hang on a sec, 13!

397
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,041
I dunno what you have
planned, but it's suicide!

398
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,583
[clicks tongue]

399
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,625
Do you honestly think
I would dance Swan Lake

400
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,125
or something stupid like that?

401
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,250
[SOLDIERS gasp]

402
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,291
[SOLDIER #13]
Just watch and learn.

403
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,916
I'll show you why they call
me the Harlequeen 13--

404
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,791
[SOLDIER #13 screaming]

405
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,958
[SOLDIER #15]
Harlequeen 13!

406
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,583
Huh?! Why am I fall--?!

407
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,083
[OTSUKI]
Next, #5.

408
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,666
Don't make me say it
twice! Come on out!

409
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,166
Who drew that one?
Who is #5?

410
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,541
Is that you?

411
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,833
[SOLDIER #5] No! That's just
what it says on my hat!

412
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,708
[SOLDIER B]
Who is it then?

413
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:47,958
[SOLDIER D]
Not me!

414
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,833
[SOLDIER #8]
Hang on. Aren't you #5?

415
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,875
[SOLDIERS]
Yeah. He's dead.

416
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,041
Number 5 had better
step forward immediately!

417
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,916
What is the hold up?

418
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,458
[chuckles]

419
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,541
[SOLDIERS]
Huh?

420
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,666
I knew it!

421
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,416
Next. I don't care
who it is. Just go.

422
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,583
[SOLDIER B]
What do we do now?

423
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,958
[SOLDIER C]
We're all...

424
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,250
[SOLDIERS]
...completely screwed!

425
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,416
We could have a
thousand more men

426
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,916
and it still wouldn't
make a difference!

427
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,208
[SOLDIER #8] I've had enough
of this stupid game!

428
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,416
And I won't watch this anymore!

429
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,375
[screams]

430
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,541
I'll go stand in the hallway.

431
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,375
[FRAPPUCCINO] I'm a white
chocolate mochaccino

432
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,625
with caramel sauce,
hazelnut syrup, extra whip,

433
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,125
chocolate chips on top, and an
additional shot of espresso,

434
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,541
affogato style,
in a grande size!

435
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,625
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 19!

436
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,291
Look forward to it!

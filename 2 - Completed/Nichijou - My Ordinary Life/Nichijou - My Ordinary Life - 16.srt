1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,916
[bell tolls]

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,541
[IZUMI] All righty!
That's all the time we have.

3
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,000
And just a reminder
that the days

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,208
are starting to get shorter,

5
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,916
so be sure to get home
before the sun sets.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,583
Finally! Let's go, dude!

7
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,208
[CHIYODA]
Behind you, bro!

8
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,750
A bunch of people seem to
think plasma is the answer,

9
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,708
but I'm not entirely
sure if they're correct.

10
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:30,833
I prefer gathering evidence...

11
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:31,458
[YUUKO]
Hey, Nano!

12
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,500
[NANO]
Ah! Yes?

13
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,083
Wanna walk home together?

14
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,333
We can grab a bite, too!

15
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,500
Whaddaya say?

16
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,416
[gasps]

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,541
So? Wanna?

18
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,625
Uh. Well.

19
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,791
Hey! Mio, you should come, too.

20
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,500
Well, poop. It looks
like she bailed already.

21
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,791
Anyway.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,666
Weird.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,416
[STUDENT B]
He was like super gross.

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,166
I ran into him at the mall
when I was getting my coffee...

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,875
I can't believe I just did that.

26
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,333
Leaving her alone there was
so thoughtless and mean.

27
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,666
Maybe if I'd introduced
myself like a normal girl,

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,041
it would've been easier
to hide in plain sight.

29
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,666
[NANO] Uh, hi.
My name's Nano Shinonome!

30
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,416
And, um, you see, I, uh,
I was on my way to school

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,708
and then I...

32
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,291
[NANO sighs]

33
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,958
[YUUKO] I heard the local coffee
shop got remodeled recently,

34
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,250
so I went over to take a peek.

35
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,791
[TAMAMURA]
Uh, miss?

36
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,000
Are you ready to order?

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,708
Just the espresso.
The "T" one.

38
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,291
Um, so, uh,

39
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,291
you would like one espresso
in a tall, is that correct?

40
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,541
[YUUKO]
Wait, in a what? "Tall"?

41
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,583
That's what "T" stands for?

42
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,000
[YUUKO chuckles nervously]

43
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,583
You know what, that T espresso
thing sounds pretty good

44
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,875
in a tall.

45
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,250
So, yeah, uh.

46
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:49,250
Lemme get the T espresso...
in a small size?

47
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,750
[TAMAMURA gasps]

48
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,166
You wanna order the short
espresso instead of the tall?

49
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,791
[YUUKO gasping]

50
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,750
Uh-huh.

51
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,250
I'll take it in a small short!

52
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,833
That's the one I want!

53
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:09,500
Um. Sure. So with the
espresso order-- Uh!

54
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,833
[YUUKO gasps]

55
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:14,291
It, uh-- You can get it
served either hot or cold.

56
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,416
[gasps] Hot please!

57
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,250
[TAMAMURA]
Okay then.

58
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,416
I'll whip that up
for you right away.

59
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,416
For size...

60
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
[TAMAMURA]
...it varies.

61
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,625
You can get a solo or doppio.

62
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,375
[YUUKO]
D-D-Doppi-what? Doppio?

63
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,708
What the heck is a doppio?
Is that even a real word?

64
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,500
How am I supposed to
know what that means?

65
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:40,000
Does it even say it anywhere?
What is doppio?

66
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,958
Actually, scratch that,
I changed my mind.

67
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,375
I'm just gonna get
today's special--

68
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,958
whatever that drink
happens to be.

69
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,541
[TAMAMURA]
Well, uh.

70
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,958
For today, the special
is also the espresso.

71
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,958
[screams]

72
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,250
Fine then. That one.

73
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,166
[TAMAMURA]
Right.

74
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,833
Would that be a solo...

75
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,291
...or a doppio for this order?

76
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:16,166
Or a doppio? Or a doppio?
Or a doppio for this order?

77
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,125
[YUUKO]
Sure.

78
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll take it.

79
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,375
Huh?

80
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,333
[YUUKO]
I mean, uh...

81
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,166
[YUUKO] Just gimme whatever
feels right in your heart.

82
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,083
Coming right up then.

83
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,458
[ARATA]
Thank you for waiting.

84
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,708
Here's your solo espresso.

85
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,583
[YUUKO]
It's so tiny.

86
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,541
[YUUKO]
And so bitter!

87
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,458
[TAMAMURA, ARATA]
Thank you! Please come again!

88
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,625
[YUUKO]
Welp, I have no choice.

89
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,125
It's vending machines for life.

90
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,541
They'll never judge me.

91
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,958
[OURA]
For my dear grandson's birthday,

92
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,333
I bought him a brand
new baseball glove.

93
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,041
Grandpa! Here it comes!

94
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,666
Try your best, my boy!

95
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,541
You're pretty far away,
so give it all you've got!

96
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,875
[OURA]
Ah, the young people.

97
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,583
Always so full of
excitement and dreams.

98
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,958
You ready?!

99
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,541
Ready as I'll ever be.

100
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,541
Now throw it as hard as you can!

101
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,375
[OURA] This is the perfect
opportunity to show him

102
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,583
how cool his grandpa can be.

103
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,750
[OURA]
Curveball.

104
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,458
[YUUKO]
Uh, 'scuse me.

105
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,791
[HASEGAWA]
Yes?

106
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,625
Can I get one of these
Agonizing Super-Hot Chef's

107
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,208
Fanciful Chicken Bars
on a stick please?

108
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,625
[chuckles]

109
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,958
Seriously? You actually
want one of those things?

110
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,375
[YUUKO wailing]

111
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,250
What's the matter, Koujirou?

112
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,375
Oh, yeah. I gotta hurry
before the post offices clo--

113
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:56,958
[YUUKO]
Mio!

114
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,041
[screams]

115
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,166
Oh, it's you. What up?

116
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,708
I was lookin' for ya.

117
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,375
You kinda booked it as soon
as homeroom was over, y'know?

118
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,166
Yeah. I guess I did.

119
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,500
Well, it doesn't matter.

120
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,000
Now that we're here,
why don't we walk home t--?

121
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,333
I gotta do something.

122
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,750
Really? What?

123
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,166
[MIO] It's, uh...
It's kinda hard to explain.

124
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,833
[YUUKO] Ah, come on!
It can't be that hard.

125
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,458
You should at least try.

126
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,750
Uh, I just have, um, a thing!

127
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,958
[YUUKO]
What kind of thing? Is it a--?

128
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,583
[POLICEMAN A]
Excuse me a moment.

129
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,333
You're a...

130
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,250
I didn't do it!

131
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,333
[MIO, POLICEMAN A yelp]

132
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,208
Wait, what? He didn't
ask anything!

133
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,500
Uh! That was just
a weird reflex.

134
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,291
[MIO groans]

135
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,375
[POLICEMAN A chuckles]

136
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,000
I didn't mean to catch
you off guard.

137
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,000
And relax, you're not
in any trouble.

138
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,333
That's good.

139
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,333
Is there something we can
help you with, officer?

140
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,916
Yes, actually.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,875
Some counterfeit bills have been
used in these vending machines.

142
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:48,958
I was wondering if you've seen

143
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,166
any suspicious activity
in the area.

144
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,708
I haven't seen any.

145
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,333
Me neither, but I don't
pass by here that often.

146
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,250
Based on an eyewitness report,
there was a shady person

147
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,916
carrying a beige tote
with red stripes.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,958
Hm.

149
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,625
Nah. There's no way
that you could--

150
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,791
[MIO screams]

151
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,208
[YUUKO]
Wait.

152
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,875
Why is she actually making that
weird, kinda gross face?

153
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,083
Did she actually do it?
Is she the culprit?

154
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,500
No way. She would never do that.

155
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,750
Mio. Quit joking around already.

156
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,125
[YUUKO screams]

157
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,500
[YUUKO]
Is she squealing on herself?

158
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,458
She'd never survive
in the slammer!

159
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,625
Wait a second.

160
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,541
You aren't the one
that did it, are you?

161
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,958
That's crazy talk!

162
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,375
She's just super into volleyball

163
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,583
and is practicing her
bumping form or whatever.

164
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,625
Isn't that right?

165
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,958
Okay then.

166
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,208
If it's all right with you two,

167
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,541
I'd like to check inside
your bags just in case.

168
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,208
Of course! Go ahead!

169
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,833
Hear that? We--

170
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,208
[YUUKO screams]

171
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,375
[YUUKO]
She whipped it out!

172
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,833
She has a real fake bill!

173
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:49,666
It's all over now! I can't
believe my friend's a criminal!

174
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,166
Take this... and please
look the other way.

175
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,875
Take the money! And let me go!

176
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,750
Is this one of your
counterfeit bills?

177
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,291

She's here so often,
it's like a second home!

352
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,083
Right? Isn't that
right? Huh? Huh?

353
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,125
Whatchu talkin' 'bout?

354
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,166
[NANO]
Would you take a hint?!

355
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,875
[NANO] Uh, please excuse me!
I'll go make some more tea!

356
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,708
Ah! No need! I got it!

357
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,333
Well, more like, you got it.

358
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,666
[gasps]

359
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,791
Huh?

360
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,333
[screams]

361
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,125
There you go!

362
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,916
That is the coolest ever!

363
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,791
[wailing]

364
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,375
And the other hand is a gun.

365
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,916
There's more?
That's even cooler!

366
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,125
[HAKASE chuckles]

367
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,375
[NANO]
My life is over.

368
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,333
[HAKASE, YUUKO laughing]

369
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,375
And next up, we're gonna say
a buncha random cool things!

370
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,875
Yay!

371
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,208
Our first contestant
is yours truly!

372
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,291
Hey. Open your eyes. Wake up.

373
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,041
Don't you die on me!

374
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,458
Wow. Now that's a cool scene!

375
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,000
Now, Hakase!

376
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:40,875
Me!

377
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,375
Rhinoceros Beetle!

378
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,875
That's cool!

379
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,875
[NANO] So... why did
she come over anyway?

380
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,166
They're on top of each other!

381
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,083
I give! I give!

382
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,333
You're so tiny!

383
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,625
It's too big!

384
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,833
'Kay. I'mma go.

385
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,833
[NANO]
She came for nothing?

386
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,583
[YUUKO]
Thanks for having me over.

387
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,333
Sorry I stayed so late.

388
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,416
[NANO]
Uh. No problem.

389
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,708
And, um, I wanted to say.

390
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,958
[YUUKO]
Yeah?

391
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,041
[NANO] Truth is, I've
actually been practicing

392
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,416
some magic tricks lately!

393
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,291
So I'm not a robot,
or anything, I swear!

394
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,958
[YUUKO]
Yeah, I already knew that.

395
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,625
You're Nano. And that's
good enough for me!

396
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,458
There we go.

397
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,708
As long as you're happy
with who you are,

398
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,250
that's all that matters.

399
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,666
I just wanted to stop by
here and tell you that.

400
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,500
But I got distracted.

401
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,291
See you at school, Nano!

402
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,291
[NANO]
Uh. Yeah.

403
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,166
[YUUKO humming]

404
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,583
[door opens]

405
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,083
[NANO]
Hey!

406
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,333
[YUUKO]
Hm?

407
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,541
Uh.

408
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,916
Come by at any time.

409
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,750
Sure! Sounds fun!

410
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,583
Really? Hooray!

411
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,375
I gotcha! How 'bout
we doodle next time?

412
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,291
[HAKASE] Yeah! We can
draw sharks and stuff!

413
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,125
[YUUKO] Oh, I like that!
Sharks are cool!

414
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,208
[HAKASE]
They sure are! They're the best!

415
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,041
[YUUKO] You really like those
sharks, don'tcha, Hakase?

416
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,041
[HAKASE]
Not like! I love sharks!

417
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:15,958
They're the coolest!

418
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,333
[YUUKO]
Rawr! I'mma shark!

419
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,583
[HAKASE]
Do more! Do more shark things!

420
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,750
[YUUKO]
Rawr! Shark attack! Rawr!

421
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,791
[HAKASE]
Again! Again!

422
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,250
[sighs]

423
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,750
[NANO]
Hakase! I wanna play!

424
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,500
[YUUKO]
Look out! I'm gonna thrash!

425
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,541
--[HAKASE] So cool!
--[NANO] Oh, no!

426
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,791
[YUUKO]
Me shark! Me hungry!

427
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,750
Hi, Sakamoto!

428
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,375
'Kay, bye!

429
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,666
[SAKAMOTO]
See ya.

430
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,083
Huh, bizarre.

431
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,875
[SCREW A]
It's me, the screw!

432
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,083
I have a Phillip's head,
so that's a plus!

433
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,125
I also give off plenty
of positive vibes,

434
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,458
so I'm sure that adds
lots to my character!

435
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,750
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 17.

436
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,250
Look forward to it!

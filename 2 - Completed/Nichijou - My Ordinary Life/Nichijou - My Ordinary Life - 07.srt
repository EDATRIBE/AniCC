[DOLPH humming]

00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,958
[humming continues]

00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,875
[DOLPH humming]

4
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:39,916
[knocking]

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
[DOLPH]
Hm?

6
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,500
[SOLDIER #53]
I've brought him, sir.

7
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,791
Enter.

8
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,791
[ALBERT growls]

9
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,583
[chuckles] Why, if it isn't
the great King Albert.

10
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,125
[ALBERT growls]

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,666
Why you...

12
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,750
Tell me, what's the
meaning of this, Dolph?

13
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,958
[DOLPH chuckles]
Oh, calm yourself.

14
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,458
I simply hoped we could
enjoy a meal together.

15
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,500
[ALBERT growls]

16
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,041
[inaudible]

17
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,958
[gasps] Well, that's a shame.

18
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:19,291
It seems as though there is
no more food left for you.

19
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,416
[laughing]

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,041
[growls]

21
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,291
[DOLPH]
Restrain him.

22
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,291
[SOLDIER #19]
Sir.

23
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,916
[ALBERT growling]

24
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,041
[DOLPH]
Huh...

25
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,958
So that's what you were after?!

26
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,625
[laughs]

27
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,708
Now, what do you say we end
this game of hide-and-seek

28
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:49,125
with that princess
of yours, King Albert?

29
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,916
Well? Your Majesty?

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,458
[ALBERT growls]

31
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:59,041
[DOLPH laughs]

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,125
[STARLA panting]

33
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,250
[SOLDIER A]
Did you find her?

34
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,458
[SOLDIER B]
Negative!

35
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,875
[SOLDIER A]
I'll check this section.

36
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,333
[SOLDIER #16]
Listen closely, men!

37
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,208
We're only after
the wooden cube!

38
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,208
Try not to kill the princess!

39
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,666
[ALBERT] Don't think for
a single moment you'll

40
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,833
get away with this,
Dolph. Hear me?

41
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,583
[DOLPH laughs]
I already have.

42
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:24,500
I'm afraid nobody has the power
to stop me at this point.

43
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,041
You're out of allies,
and out of luck.

44
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,500
What a shame. Right, Albert?

45
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,625
[laughing]

46
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,041
[ALBERT grunts]

47
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,083
[DOLPH] Thank you for this
little globetrotting trip

48
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,541
of yours. It was the most
perfect opportunity

49
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,333
you could have given me.

50
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,125
With the help of
my subordinates,

51
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,291
I was able to trap you
and the princess!

52
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,500
But why? What brought
upon this betrayal?

53
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:52,208
It looks like you still
don't understand at all.

54
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,666
I'm grateful for
everything you've done.

55
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,666
Raising an orphan like
me as one of your own,

56
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,416
and even appointing me as the
commander of your kingdom.

57
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,125
I don't understand.

58
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,166
[laughs]

59
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,208
Are you really this foolish?

60
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,250
It's because I have
my own ambitions.

61
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,666
[growls]

62
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,250
This is the kind of divine
punishment that you deserve.

63
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,875
Accept it.

64
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,708
[SOLDIER #16]
Lord Dolph!

65
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,541
Huh?

66
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,000
We've located the princess!

67
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,875
Okay! Let's boogie!

68
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,083
Excuse me.

69
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,541
Take this time
to think carefully

70
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,041
about your dying
words, won't you?

71
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,125
King Albert.

72
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,166
[ALBERT growls]
You filthy traitor!

73
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,916
What do you think
you're doing?!

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,958
Have you all completely
lost your minds?

75
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,625
[DOLPH] Well, if it isn't
Princess Starla herself.

76
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,916
It's so good to see you.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,833
[STARLA]
Dolph, you bastard!

78
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:49,000
You have no freakin' idea
what you've done, do you?

79
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,791
[laughs] What a shame to ruin

80
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,333
that pretty face with
such a dirty mouth.

81
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,500
Of course I know what I've done.

82
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,750
I've taken King Albert's
precious wooden cube.

83
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,458
And once I get my hands
on your cube as well,

84
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,041
I'll be able to revive
the ancient weapon.

85
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,958
Then I'll finally
be able to ascend

86
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,583
as the new King of
the Fey Kingdom!

87
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,125
[laughs] Struggle all you wish,
but no one will save you.

88
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,958
There's nowhere to run anymore!

89
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,958
Now, hand it over peacefully
and I might let you live!

90
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,791
[DOLPH groans]

91
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,333
[gasping]

92
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,083
[gasping]

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,250
Whoa. Dolph is dead!

94
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,083
[gasping]

95
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,958
[SOLDIERS gasping, chattering]

96
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,458
Hurrah! All hail
the Princess, hurrah!

97
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:10,125
All hail the princess, hurrah!
All hail the princess, hurrah!

98
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,041
All hail...

99
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,125
[BOTH]
...the princess! Hurrah!

100
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,000
All hail the princess, hurrah!

101
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,750
[SOLDIERS]
All hail the princess, hurrah!

102
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,541
All hail the princess, hurrah!
All hail the princess, hurrah!

103
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:26,541
All hail the princess, hurrah...

104
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,375
You bastards!

105
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,291
[SOLDIERS scream]

106
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,541
You guys all owe me big time!

107
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,666
[SOLDIERS sigh]

108
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,083
[SOLDIERS chattering]

109
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,791
Now, then! Bring me to
my father right away!

110
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,500
[SOLDIERS cheer]

111
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,583
[SOLDIER #8]
Hm? Wait a sec.

112
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:51,583
Isn't this the item the princess
was protecting earlier?

113
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,333
Yeah, then that must mean...

114
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:04,416
[SOLDIER #8]
Uh? Wait... what?!

115
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,458
[SOLDIER #8 gasping]
Then, that means...

116
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,666
I could have the
power to be king!

117
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,291
No, hang on,
let's not get crazy here.

118
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,541
Man, I could really
use a cigarette.

119
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,916
[SOLDIER #8]
After 12 long years of service,

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,791
I honestly thought
I would live out

121
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,500
the rest of my
life as a soldier.

122
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,291
But now... To have
a chance like this...

123
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,500
[SOLDIER #8]
I could never.

124
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,791
I have no reason
to become king.

125
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,166
I wouldn't know what
to do if I did.

126
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,416
And even with both cubes
in my possession,

127
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,916
I couldn't revive that
ancient weapon if I tried.

128
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:12,666
No!

129
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,958
[YUUKO]
Wha--?!

130
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,583
What a beautiful morning.

131
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,458
[YUUKO]
All right! I won! I think?

132
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,916
I did! Awesome!

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,833
Check it out! I just
won a 100,000 yen

134
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,291
in this lottery prize thing!

135
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,250
Really?! You gonna treat me
to a cut of that or what?

136
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,541
I don't even know what to
treat myself with first!

137
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,541
What do I even buy? Like a
car or a house or something?

138
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,250
Hang on a sec.

139
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,000
This, uh, is from last year.

140
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,291
[YUUKO]
Uhh...

141
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,791
Don't sweat it, the lottery
is almost impossible to win,

142
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,083
so it's fine.

143
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,375
[YUUKO] I know, but it
still breaks my heart.

144
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,708
Don't be like that.

145
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,291
You shouldn't be so down
on your birthday, so here!

146
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:20,000
Huh? For real? A present?
Thanks so much!

147
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,291
Can I open it now?

148
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,250
[MIO] Mm-hm. It's really
nothing special.

149
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,416
Just something that I had
laying around the house.

150
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,583
I'm sure it's great!
A gift is a gift!

151
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,583
It's the thought that counts!

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,958
[TAKASAKI]
Miss Sakurai?

153
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,708
Huh?

154
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,291
Oh, Mr. Takasaki!
How are you this morning?

155
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,750
I'm fine, thank you. So, um...

156
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,041
What are you gonna do
about that Aioi kid?

157
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,708
She never even attempts to
do her assigned homework.

158
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,250
Oh, uh! I, uh... I'm sorry!

159
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,333
I think a nice, stern lecture
from her teacher-slash-counselor

160
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,375
would help set her straight.

161
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,458
Uh, sure. I can try.

162
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,375
I'll see if there's something
I can do for her.

163
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:08,250
Now if you'll please excuse me,
I have a class.

164
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,750
[TAKASAKI]
I'm counting on you!

165
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,541
Excuse me.

166
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,875
[TOMIOKA gasps]

167
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,541
I'm so sorry!
Are you all right?

168
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,125
I didn't spill any
on you, did I?

169
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,500
[sighs]

170
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,791
[TOMIOKA]
No, no, I'm perfectly fine.

171
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,916
Don't worry about it!

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,041
[TAKASAKI]
I just want to protect her!

173
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,250
In my 26 years on this Earth,

174
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,250
I've always had absolutely
no luck with women.

175
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,791
But now, feelings for
her have sprouted

176
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,375
like a surprise bamboo

00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,083
[YOSHINO]
Heh.

349
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,833
[YOSHINO]
Huh. Would ya look at that.

350
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,000
[NANO screams]

351
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,250
Heh, heh.

352
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,333
[gasping]

353
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,375
[NANO]
It came off!

354
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,875
Finally! It came off!

355
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,208
I'm free!

356
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,250
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

357
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,125
[YOSHINO]
Mio!

358
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:19,958
[MIO]
Hm?

359
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,208
Hey, I'll walk with you.

360
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,791
Okay. Are you on your
way back from class too?

361
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,083
[YOSHINO] Yeah, Oh, I just met
the most interesting person!

362
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,625
[MIO]
Really? Tell me about 'em.

363
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,958
[YOSHINO]
Well, her arm came off.

364
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,125
[MIO]
Huh?

365
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,375
[YOSHINO]
And she had a key in her back.

366
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,708
[MIO]
What?! No way!

367
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,833
[YOSHINO] I'm not kidding!
That's how she was!

368
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,916
[MIO]
Sounds pretty weird to me.

369
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,750
[WORD-TIME NARRATOR] I want
people to look at me and think,

370
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,916
"Oh, he looks pretty cool!"

371
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,916
Hey! You ready, Nano?

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,666
Okay!

373
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,916
[HAKASE]
Magic ball!

374
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,750
[SAKAMOTO]
Well, she is just a child.

375
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,250
Not surprising.

376
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,291
--[SAKAMOTO gasps]
--[HAKASE] I win!

377
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,833
Aw man, I lost!

378
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,041
[SAKAMOTO]
What are they doing?

379
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,958
That is not how
you play this game.

380
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,916
Sakamoto! How many
points did I just get?

381
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
[SAKAMOTO]
What?!

382
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,208
'Kay! It's my turn
to throw the ball!

383
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,625
Go!

384
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,208
[SAKAMOTO]
She hasn't even pitched yet!

385
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:31,416
[SAKAMOTO gasping]

386
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,250
[SAKAMOTO] Is she trying
to kill me with that?

387
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,791
Sakamoto! How many points
did I get for that one, huh?

388
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,750
[SAKAMOTO]
Oh, come on!

389
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,958
She swung again!

390
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,666
You're up. Go get 'em, champ.

391
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,041
[SAKAMOTO]
How do you expect me to do that?

392
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,416
There's no way hold that
bat in these little paws!

393
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,291
Aww...

394
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,916
[SAKAMOTO]
Unbelievable.

395
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,791
You'd think you would understand
how paws work at this point.

396
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,000
Since you're poking at
my pads all the time.

397
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,958
You kids can be so
simple-mind... ed...

398
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,458
[SAKAMOTO grunting]

399
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,375
[NANO, HAKASE]
Aww...

400
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,833
[SAKAMOTO]
Uh, okay then. Mew-ving on.

401
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,583
The way you kids are playing
isn't safe, so, I uh guess

402
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,708
I'll just have to sit here
and keep an eye on you.

403
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,875
Why don't you just put
the bat down and play catch?

404
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,500
--Sure!
--You got it, coach!

405
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,750
[SAKAMOTO]
Coach?

406
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,166
Coach, what do we do if
we only have one glove?

407
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,958
[SAKAMOTO] I think you'll
be fine without one.

408
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,375
Hey, coach! This glove
doesn't fit my little hand.

409
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,500
[SAKAMOTO] It goes on the other
hand like you had it before!

410
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,500
[NANO]
Help us, coach!

411
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,875
[HAKASE]
C'mon, coach!

412
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:41,625
[SAKAMOTO] Huh?! What would
you kids do without me?

413
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,583
[NANO]
Hakase! Here comes the ball!

414
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,208
Bring it!

415
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,291
[NANO grunts]

416
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,666
Oh no, where on earth
could it have landed?

417
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,250
[YUUKO] And then the teacher
totally freaked out at me!

418
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,416
[MIO giggles]
Can't blame him.

419
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,750
[MAI]
Agreed.

420
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,791
You guys really think so?

421
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,791
I think he went a little
overboard, personally.

422
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,875
[MIO] Yeah, maybe, but you
gotta watch out from now on.

423
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,166
[YUUKO]
Yeah, I guess you're right.

424
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,500
It could only get
worse from here.

425
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,083
Oh, thank you, sir.

426
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,708
[VOICE OF GOD]
A true gentleman!

427
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,583
[YUUKO] So, do mind
if I borrow it from ya

428
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,250
sometime, Mai, please?

429
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,166
[MAI]
Sure.

430
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,416
[YUUKO]
Great! You're the best!

431
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,375
[MIO] I wonder if that's
the girl my sister met?

432
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,500
[YUUKO]
...man I'm starving!

433
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,541
[YUUKO grunting]

434
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,500
[YUUKO grunting]

435
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,125
[CUBE]
I am a Wooden Cube.

436
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,333
My master can only obtain
the ancient weapon

437
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,458
of legend by using
my power. [laughs]

438
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,875
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 8.

439
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,750
Look forward to it!

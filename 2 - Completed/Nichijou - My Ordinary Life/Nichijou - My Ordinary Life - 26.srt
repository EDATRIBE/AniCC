[MIO]
Yeah?

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,541
[YUUKO] We should throw Nano
a surprise birthday party!

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,833
[MIO] Oh, sure!
When do you wanna do it?

5
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:18,750
Today.

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,833
Today?

7
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,375
You could give us
more of a heads up

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,958
before planning this stuff.

9
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:23,916
My b!

'Kay. [groans]

11
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,666
I got nothin'.

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,541
What can we put
together in a day?

13
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,041
Well, I honestly don't even know
if today is her actual birthday,

14
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,791
so I wouldn't sweat
the details too much.

15
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:34,958
[MIO]
Then what's the point?

16
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:35,791
Because.

17
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:36,708
Because what?

18
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,083
That's what makes it a surprise!

19
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,416
I guess so?

20
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,333
[MAI]
Hakase, too.

21
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,583
[BOTH]
Huh?

22
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,833
We should also celebrate
Hakase's birthday today.

23
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,041
Ooh! Yeah, sure!

24
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,666
Knocking out two birthdays
at once? I like it!

25
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,250
[MIO]
Now that I think about it,

26
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,875
I guess surprise parties can
still be fun for everyone,

27
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,875
even if it's not
anybody's birthday.

28
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,166
[MIO]
Okay, I got it!

29
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,416
We should all go pick up a cake

30
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,375
for the party
after school today!

31
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,583
Let's do it!

32
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,458
Does that sound
good to you, Mai?

33
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,708
I left my purse at home.

35

Oh. That's all right.

36
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,125
Yuuko and I can split it then.

37
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,958

my wallet, too.

Uh...

41
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,500
I suppose I never paid you back

42
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,166
for all that money I lost
at the amusement park.

43
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,833
So, don't worry about
the birthday cake.

44
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:24,833
It's on me.

46
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:27,916
I'm gonna go tell Nano about

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,500
the awesome party we're
throwing for her!

48
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:30,875
It's supposed to be a surprise!

50
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,375

[gasps] Uh... Yeah?

53
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,375
Well, at least Koujirou
didn't shoot me down.

54
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,333
Wow!

55
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,291
Hey! I wasn't shot down!

56
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,416
Oh, yeah? Then why'd
you run away crying?

57

[MIO gasps]
I, uh...

58
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,916
I was just surprised by
the sudden turn of events

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,375
and needed a hot second
to process it all, 'kay?

60

Koujirou having a girl on his
arm doesn't mean anything!

And I haven't even tried
to tell him how I feel yet.

down to my face,

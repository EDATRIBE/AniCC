00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,291
[TANAKA]
Man, it's so hot out.

2
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,416
Super-duper hot!

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Ah. Can you cut
it out? I feel it.

4
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,416
This heat has been
hard on me, too.

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,791
But ya know, when you bring it
up, it makes it worse, 'kay?

6
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,875
So could you stop
saying it's hot?

7
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,625
Okay, okay.

8
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,333
Man, it's a scorcher out here!

9
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,708
It's blistering.
Sweltering, even!

10
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,958
Do ya know what I mean, man?

11
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,916
Feels like I'm in an oven!
I'm baking out here! Broiling!

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,125
So humid!

13
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,791
[NAKANOJOU]
I could punch him right now.

14
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:58,708
Nobody would know.

15
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,708
[TANAKA]
What's with the sun?

16
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,041
This gotta be a record!

17
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,416
Dude, seriously,
it is like fire!

18
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,291
[humming]

19
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,083
[YUUKO]
What a beautiful day!

20
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,791
The sky is blue,
birds are chirping,

21
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,791
butterflies are fluttering.

22
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:48,708
The air, the people, and yes,
even this very classroom.

23
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,333
Everything is great!

24
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:54,583
Because... I actually did
the homework for today!

25
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,958
[giggles]

26
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,000
[YUUKO] I bet Mio willl get
a real kick outta this.

27
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:03,916
[humming]

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
[YUUKO]
Huh?

29
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,666
Hang on. Oh, no.

30
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,000
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

31
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,791
No!

32
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,916
[screaming]

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,416
[YUUKO] It can't be!
You've gotta be kidding me!

34
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,625
The one time I actually
did my homework?

35
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,791
Why?

36
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:25,833
Why did this have
to happen? Why me?

37
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,916
Oh, well, guess I'll just
have to copy it again.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,250
Hey, Mio, question!

39
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,708
[YUUKO]
Hm?

40
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,541
Wait, our homework.

41
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,708
That's right. We had to...
fill in a worksheet!

42
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,583
[YUUKO crying]

43
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,166
What's the matter with you?

44
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,583
Did something happen, Yuuko?

45
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,625
[YUUKO]
My homework. I left it at home.

46
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,208
There's no hope. There's
nothing good in this world.

47
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,125
But you always forget
to do your homework.

48
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,583
It's different this time!

49
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,416
I did it, but I didn't bring it!

50
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,583
[MIO]
Uh, yeah, okay I hear ya.

51
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,000
It's the worksheet we
got yesterday, right?

52
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,416
You sure it isn't jammed
inside your bag somewhere?

53
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,208
Check one more time to see.

54
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,250
I just turned this whole thing
inside-out and got nothing.

55
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,000
There's no way it's--

56
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,041
[gasps]

57
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,750
Whoa!

58
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,541
My God!

59
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,875
Ah! What the hell
is a Daifuku Fair?!

60
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,041
What's fair? Nothing.

61
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,250
[MIO]
Uh, don't worry about it.

62
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,750
Hey, who knows?

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,333
Maybe there's an extra that
was left on the front desk.

64
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,250
Are you for real?
It's a miracle!

65
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,791
[YUUKO]
Dammit!

66
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,625
Dammit, dammit! Damn all of it!

67
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,500
Are you going back home?
But there's no time!

68
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,750
You're right.
But I have to... try!

69
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,083
[BOTH]
Uh.

70
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,458
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

71
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,291
Go and take your seats.

72
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,291
[grunting]

73
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,833
[gasps]

74
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,125
[HAKASE]
Twisty, twisty, twisty, twisty,

75
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,083
twisty, twisty, spinning,
and spinning...

76
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,333
[SHINONOME NARRATOR]
Slow and steady wins the race.

77
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,791
[YUUKO]
Out in the hall again.

78
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,583
Why is it that I can
never get my homework in?

79
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,041
Am I cursed?

80
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,500
I always end up failing.
Even when I actually finish it.

81
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,083
School is a cruel mistress.

82
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,541
[HAKASE]
Hey, Sakamoto.

83
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,458
[SAKAMOTO]
Hm?

84
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,375
Look at my business card.

85
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,750
[HAKASE giggles]

86
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:49,291
[SAKAMOTO] Uh? What is
this about? What do I say?

87
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,458
[HAKASE chuckles]

88
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,875
[SAKAMOTO]
What's happening?

89
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,083
[chuckling]

90
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,458
[SAKAMOTO] What am I
supposed to do with this?

91
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,750
[MISATO]
Excuse me!

92
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,250
[MISATO gasps]

93
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,041
[KOUJIROU] What seems to be
the problem, Miss Tachibana?

94
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,708
[MISATO]
Uh, nothing!

95
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,500
The vending machine
got some new drinks,

96
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,333
and I was just deciding
on which one I wanted.

97
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,625
Oh. Is that so?

98
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,958
Well, then, I recommend--

99
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,958
[MISATO] I don't need you
to tell me what to get!

100
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,750
...you stay away
from this option,

101
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,208
but the one next to it is
actually quite refreshing.

102
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,250
Enjoy your drink.

103
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,166
It's not like I bought this
drink because you pointed at it!

104
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,750
[ANNAKA]
I heard the neighborhood had

105
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,125
some pop-up stalls, so I
decided to check them out.

106
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,375
I am so excited that
this game is here.

107
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,166
A carnival shooting gallery!

108
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,791
I've never seen
one in real life!

109
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,166
But all I have on me
is a 500 yen coin.

110
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,583
I hope it'll be enough.

111
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,125
[GAME RUNNER A] Step right up!
One round is 500 yen!

112
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,208
[ANNAKA]
Perfect!

113
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,041
Isn't that convenient?!

114
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,750
I wish I had enough
for some <i>yakisoba</i> , too.

115
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,708
But this'll be worth it.

116
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,458
[gasps]

117
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,833
[ANNAKA] There's only
caramels and eggplants?

118
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,416
Uh... Do you have
any other prizes?

119
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,291
Whaddaya mean other prizes?

120
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,708
We've only got the finest
quality, brand-name goods here!

121
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,583
[GAME RUNNER A laughing]

122
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,791
[ANNAKA]
He already took my money,

123
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,583
so I might as well go for it.

124
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,708
Don't wanna leave empty handed.

125
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,625
[gasps]

126
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,125
Nice try, Miss,

127
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,125
but you shouldn't shoot for
the grand prize right away.

128
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,666
Beginner's luck won't
help you with that one!

129
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,041
[ANNAKA]
Grand prize?

130
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,750
Why don't you aim for
something smaller?

131
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,708
It's prob'ly more your speed!

132
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,583
Go ahead!

133
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,083
[ANNAKA]
More my speed?

134
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,500
Whatever. Might as well go
for the only other option.

135
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,125
[gasps, yells]

136
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,375
So close!

137
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,000
[ANNAKA] Okay, that box
has to be glued down.

138
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,541
Just a little more you
and woulda had it.

139
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,291
Looks like you're a pretty good
sharpshooter there, Miss!

140
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,291
Don't tell me. You're not a
professional gunman, are you?

141
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,708
Yeah, as if!

142
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,666
[laughing]

143
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,375
[ANNAKA] Ah! That thing
isn't budging an inch!

144
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,166
Oh, no. What're you
making that face for?

145
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,208
You aren't thinking that the
game is rigged, now are you?

146
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,916
Yeah, my stall might not be
the fanciest one out there,

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,291
but an honest and genuine
experience is guaranteed!

148
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,625
[ANNAKA]
Yeah, right.

149
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,833
There's definitely something
fishy going on here.

150
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,250
[yelps]

151
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,500
What is that?

152
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,833
Ah! Look! Right in the middle!

153
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,708
There's a nail! You totally
nailed down that eggplant!

154
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,666
I'd call this whole thing
a racket, wouldn't you?

155
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,125
Come on! Why are you giving
me the silent treatment now?

156
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,541
Have you no shame for preying
on innocent people?

157
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,000
I bet this entire
operation is rigged!

158
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,458
And what happened to
all that big talk

159
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,708
you were spewing earlier, huh?

160
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,541
What's the point in
pretending to sleep?

161
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,875
I've still got one shot left

162
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,541
and I have a pretty good
idea where to put it!

163
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,583
[ANNAKA]
Hm?

164
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,750
[GAME RUNNER A]
Don't ever come back.

165
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,583
[ANNAKA]
Like I'd want to.

166
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,166
[MIO, YUUKO] Things we
think are freakin' cool!

167

Wow! Super bouncy balls!

00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,458
[YUUKO, MIO] Things we
think are freakin' cool!

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,583
Aw! I had it!

Hang on, I know I
put it in my bag.

It should be right
here, but it's not,

Well, I didn't mean your name.

All I need is the names of
the items that you want.

of the items?

Since you're being me,

So then, Hakase--I mean, Nano,

284
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,416

that means I should get
this key off my back.

Ah! That doesn't make any sense!

I can Nano, but if Nano is me
and gets to eat my snacks,

297
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,583
then I don't wanna
be Nano anymore,

298
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,041

stay being Nano.

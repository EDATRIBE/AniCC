00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,666
<i>Selamat pagi</i> !

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,166
Huh? I'm the first one here?

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,583
[YUUKO]
Stag beetle dance, yeah.

4
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,208
You having fun
there? Nice moves.

5
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,625
[YUUKO gasps]
What are you doing here

6
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,375
so early in the
morning, Mr. Takasaki?

7
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,375
[TAKASAKI] Well, I am
on morning duty today.

8
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,958
I know. Why don't you
come and help me

9
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,166
take out all the
school's garbage?

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,583
[YUUKO]
Yeah, sure!

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,083
As long as you don't tell anyone
about what you just saw!

12
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,625
[TAKASAKI chuckles] You don't
have to worry about that.

13
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,500
[YUUKO]
Of course I'm gonna worry!

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,208
[NANO gasps]
That was a close one.

15
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,208
[YOSHINO]
Hey, Mio?

16
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,458
[MIO]
Hm?

17
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,666
I whipped up a batch of
homemade jam yesterday.

18
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,166
Wanna taste it for me?

19
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,208
[MIO] That's kind of
random, but, yeah, why not?

20
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,083
[YOSHINO] I used up all of
your marmalade the other day,

21
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,916
so I figured I'd
make it up to you.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,750
[MIO]
Oh, yeah.

23
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,291
Well, thanks, I guess.

24
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,708
I never would've expected you
to pull something like this.

25
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,125
It's almost like
you're a responsible

26
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,291
and considerate grown-up.

27
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,375
I can have my moments, you know!

28
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,666
Now, go ahead and try it
and tell me what you think.

29
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,541
[MIO] Okay. Let's see
what we got here.

30
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,416
Gross!

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

32
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,375
It's like my taste buds
are drowning in sewage!

33
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,416
[YOSHINO] Here! I made some
Russian tea to wash it down.

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,250
[MIO gasping]

35
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,458
[MIO]
Hot!

36
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,750
It burns! It burns!

37
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,958
Not just 'cause it's hot,
but it's gross, too!

38
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,750
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew,
ew, ew, ew, ew, ew...

39
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,916
[YOSHINO]
All right, then, uh,

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,333
maybe some more jam will help?

41
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,875
[MIO]
Why?!

42
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,708
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew,
ew, ew, ew, ew,

43
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:08,666
ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew...

44
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,166
[YOSHINO gasps]

45
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,333
[MIO]
Water!

46
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,125
Where's the water? I need water!

47
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,583
Some good, clean H2O!

48
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,875
I could drink a whole
lake right freakin' now!

49
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:20,666
Water! I need it! I need it!

50
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,166
Water!

51
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,625
[MIO]
Why?

52
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,500
[gasps] I know!

53
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,208
[MIO]
Milk! That'll do!

54
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,791
It's just what I need!

55
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,750
[screams]

56
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,041
Oh, heads up.

57
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,708
I put the rest of the jam
in that milk carton.

58
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,291
[MIO]
Why?!

59
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,666
[MIO whines]

60
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,625
[MIO] This is the worst
thing I've ever experienced

61
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,666
in my entire life! Ever!

62
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,625
What'd I do to deserve
this? Who'd I hurt?

63
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,250
What'd I do wrong?
Nothing! It's not fair!

64
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,291
I just get shafted every time!

65
00:03:54,375 --> 00:04:00,041
[MIO crying]

66
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:29,833
[gasps]

67
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:30,833
That was weird.

68
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,041
Doin' okay there?

69
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,250
[MIO]
Just look at me!

70
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,791
How could you even ask that?

71
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,250
My life was flashing
before my eyes

72
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,875
and it's all because
of your stupid jam!

73
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,916
So, no, I'm not okay,
and it's all your fault!

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,458
I knew that it
wouldn't taste good,

75
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,750
but I didn't think you'd have
such an extreme reaction.

76
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,333
If you knew it
tasted like garbage,

77
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,791
then why'd you make me taste it?

78
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,041
No reason, really.

79
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,458
I just thought it might
be kinda funny. Ha, ha.

80
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,208
[MIO]
You are the actual worst!

81
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,833
[YOSHINO]
But anyway! Question for you.

82
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,083
What kind of jam do you
think this is, huh?

83
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,166
Who cares? I don't wanna
think about some goop

84
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,458
that tastes like rotten fish!

85
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,000
[gasps]

86
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:01,958
Close!

[MIO growling]

88
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,958
You got the "fish" part right.

89
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,750
Except that it's dried!

90
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,416
[MIO]
Why?!

91
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,041
[MIO] That was the
first and last time...

92
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,250
...I ever had dried fish.

93
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,416
[SAKAMOTO snoring]

94
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500

I'm ordering take-out tonight

98
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,375
since Dad's not gonna
be home until late,

99
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,583
so let me know what
you wanna eat! [gasps]

100
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,083
He always makes such a mess.

101
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,958
Just look at all this!

102
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,250
Even after I told
him to tidy up.

103
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,583
He never listens unless
somebody scolds him.

104
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,541
Huh?

Wait, this couldn't possibly be

108
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,291
what I think it is, could it?

109
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,500
Maybe it is? It is, isn't it?

Hey!

112
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,458
Why are you snooping
around in my room?

113
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,166
[gasps] I wasn't
snooping! I, uh...

114
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,000
[MAKOTO] I told you before,
you're not allowed in here!

115
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,041
If you invade my
personal space again,

116
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,083
I'll, uh, uh,
you know, whatever!

[IZUMI]
Be strong.

121
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,791
He needs to learn his lesson.

122

Hey!

123
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,166
What did I just say about
invasion of personal space?

124
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,166
Huh? Well, I just, uh...

125
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,416
Who told you that
you could barge in

126
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,291
and clean my room anyway? Jeez!

127
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,458
[IZUMI] Well, if you refuse
to clean it yourself,

128
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,708
then you leave me no--

129
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,041
It's my organized mess,
and you're ruining it!

130
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,875

Never in my whole life!

00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,666
Really?

Well, that's crazy
'cause it isn't mine!

158
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,416
And just because you
found it in my room

159
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,791
doesn't mean squat!

160
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:35,958
Someone could've planted it
there for all you know!

161
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,541
You're so smart,
you ever think of that?

162
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,000

shouldn't be exposed to this.

How could I be exposed to
something that isn't even mine?

I didn't even know it was there,

167
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,666
so there's no reason
to freak out!

then I'll throw it away!

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,333
Also, I couldn't help
but take a peek inside,

179
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,333
and it was fascinating,
to be honest.

180
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,166
But... I still
think you shouldn't

181
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,791
look at things like that.

182
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,541
At least not till you're older.

183
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,500
[MAKOTO]
I get it already, "no looking"!

184
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,125
Now get out of my
room and stay out!

185
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,666
[IZUMI whines]

186
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,083
[sighs] She is stressing
me the heck out.

187
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,041
What does Mr. Takasaki
see in her anyway?

188
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,500
[IZUMI]
Please don't be mad at me.

189
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,125
Could you at least try
knocking, for once?

190
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,333
[IZUMI]
Well, I was just worried that

191
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,375
you might be angry
with me, so...

192
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,916
I'm not angry with you!

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,666
See? I knew you'd be upset.

194
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,208
I said I wasn't!

195
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,708
If you don't get out though,
that could change pretty quick.

196
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,458
Don't forget to knock
next time! You hear me?

197
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,416
See what happens if
you don't! [grunts]

198
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,250
Ugh, can I just
move out already?

199
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,666
[IZUMI whines] I don't
think that went well at all.

200
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,875
But I was able to clean up
his room a little bit,

201
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,000
so that's good.

202
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,666
And I'm glad that
magazine wasn't his.

203
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,291
This whole ordeal
just reminds me

204
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,375
that I have kids at
school to take care of.

205
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,250
So, I need to shape up

206
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,833
if I want to be a good
guidance counselor!

207
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,791
Be the change you want to see.

208
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,208
[gasps] I almost forgot to ask.

209
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,250
Hey, Mako? What do
you want for dinner?

210
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,625
How many times do I
have to tell you

211
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,750
to knock before you get it?!

212
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:39,875
Let's see.

213
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,041
I just wanted to
ask you if you've

214
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,625
thought about your
plans for the future.

215
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,541
Are there any goals or
aspirations you have

216
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,125
that you want to achieve after
you graduate high school?

217
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,708
Uh, yeah, sure.

218
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,166
--So, uh...
--[YUUKO] Oh!

219
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,500
I wanna be on TV at
least once before I die!

220
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,333
Uh--well, that's good,

221
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,958
but not exactly what
I was asking for.

222
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,333
I apologize.

223
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,500
Maybe my wording wasn't
quite clear enough for you.

224
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,083
I was referring to
what you'd like to do

225
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,000
for your job and the career
paths you'd like to pursue.

226
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,541
Oh. I get it.

227
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,416
In that case, yeah. I guess...

228
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,000
I'd, uh...

229
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,333
Maybe...

230
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,250
I guess I'd like to become
a respectable teacher

231
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,625
like you one day!

232
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,958
[gasps]

233
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,833
You think... that I'm a...

234
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,750
Huh?

235

[NANO]
Yes? What's up?

246
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,333
Sorry we didn't show up at
your place the other day.

247
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,833
We were on our way over,

248
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,333
but then we got attacked by
some dogs out of nowhere.

00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,750
[NANO]
Wow, I'm glad you guys are okay.

250
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,166
We'll be sure to stop by

251
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,833
and see you and Hakase sometime
soon though, I promise!

252
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,625
I look forward to it!

253
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,500
[MAKOTO] Please be our
adviser, Mr. Takasaki!

254
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,750
I said it once, and
I'll say it again: No!

255
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,333
Come on!

256
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,500
We had a deal, and you have to
keep up your end of the bargain!

257
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,583
Huh? I never made
a deal with you!

258
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,833
What? Did, too!

259
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,291
Don't you remember
we agreed that

260
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,250
if I defeated you
in a Go+Soccer match,

261
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,375
then you would become
the adviser of our club?

262

[gasps]

263
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,708
[TAKASAKI]
Oh, yeah, that one.

264
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,791
[TAKASAKI] Well! That match
ended in a draw anyway,

265
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,875
so it doesn't count!

266
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,500
Really?

267
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,916
Fine.

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,958

how you feel about my sister.

to the club room.

It's over here!

All right! Now we can
finally have a real club!

Oh, sorry! I didn't
mean to interrupt you!

But, anyway,

279
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,333
I brought a teacher who agreed
to be our new adviser!

Mr. Takasaki!

284
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,166
I wonder where he's going.

285
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,916
We're all supposed to be
getting ready for recruitment.

286
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,833
Without him around,

287
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,166
no one'll be able to explain

288
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,791
what the club is actually
supposed to do.

Eh! Whatever!

291
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,875
This is my club, so I guess
I'll keep doin' what I want!

292
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,791
Man. I'm freakin' out right now.

293
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,541
Why the heck are you
getting so nervous, anyway?

294
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,291
You're planning on confessing
to that one guy, aren't you?

Nakanojou or something?

Uh-huh! He's like
a beacon of punk

00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,458
in a sea of plain
at this school.

I can't get enough of
that mohawk of his.

299
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,208
Okay, but are there any
other features you like

300
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,625
outside of his mohawk?

away from me?

to advise this club than you!

leave it... I guess.

agreed to it earlier!

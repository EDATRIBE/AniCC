When are you gonna get
around to paying rent?

Fine.

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,791
You've been out for
three whole days,

40
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,208
so you're gonna have to catch up
on your homework quickly.

See if you can borrow your

Why didn't you remind me?

49
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,958
You were much too sick to study
anyway, so I let you rest.

Nuh-uh! I'd study in my sleep!

Would you really?

I wouldn't!

You didn't even bring it up,

00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,083
I couldn't even try to study!

56
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,708
Would you have studied
if you'd known?

57
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,375
I guess not!

on without regret.

in each coming day.

Even through all the
tears and sweat.

00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,208
Even though obstacles
stand in my way.

72
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,916
I will never give up.

On a straight track.

be on the test,

Why did I have to get over my
stupid cold today of all days?

push through the pain!

My body is still weak
from beating my last cold,

I'll have some shaved
ice for good measure.

gotten sick again.

How bad is it?

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,833
Uh. Well, lemme see.

00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,791
Huh? It's 88.8 degrees.

142
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,916
[YUUKO'S MOM]
What?

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,250
Now look at what you
did! You broke it!

144
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,416
[YUUKO] No, I didn't!
I got sick again, I swear!

145
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,875
[YUUKO'S MOM] You seem
perfectly healthy to me.

146
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,375
Yeah, It's probably because

147
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,958
there was something
in the water.

148
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,125
Thanks, man.

149
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,791
I had no idea that
today was the last day

150
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,333
to turn in our application.

151
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,791
One more day and the club
would've been a goner.

152
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,875
But even if you turn
in the form on time,

153
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,375
won't the club still
get shut down

154
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,833
for the lack of members?

155
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,791
Nah, I wouldn't
worry about that.

156
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,916
Tell ya what, how 'bout I bring
you some juice tomorrow

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,083
as a thanks.

158
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,333
You don't have to
do that. It's all good.

[DAIKU chuckles]

160
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,250
It's no problem at all! See ya!

161
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,875
Hey, I need to stop
and buy a juicer

162
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,583
and an apple orchard
on the way home.

163
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,791
[PILOT A]
Yes, sir.

164
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:57,041
[STUDENT B] Ah. So that's
the power of the Daiku Group.

165
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,583
[OURA]
No string left.

166
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,000
I won't be able to tie
together a straw doll

167
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,500
to put in the Principal's
locker if I don't have any.

168
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,916
And what's worse,

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,833
it looks like I don't even have
the straw to craft with,

170
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,208
nor do I have any
money to buy any.

171
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,708
My wife handles the
money, but she's gone.

172
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,958
We're all out of rice
and I'm hungry.

173
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,291
At times like these, a swig
of brandy would come in handy,

174
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,750
but my liver couldn't take it.

175

Great! I get to go again now!

348
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,416
So turn around!

349
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,541
[NANO]
Sure.

350
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,666
[gasps]

351
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,541
[YUUKO]
This is bad. So bad.

352
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,791
Really bad!

353
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,541
I'm still stuck on the
first stupid question!

354
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,041
What is this thing?

355
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,583
It looks like some sort of
low-level monster or something.

356
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,125
But how do I describe
that in one word?

357
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,958
[YUUKO]
Wait, I've seen this. But where?

358
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,750
I think I asked Ms. Sakurai
about it before, but when?

359
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,166
Let's see.

360
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,791
[YUUKO]
What is this supposed to be?

361
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,875
No, I'm not asking
about the answer.

362
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:02,958
I'm wondering if
you were the one

363
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,000
who drew this low-level-
looking monster.

364
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,333
[YUUKO] That's it! I did
ask about this dude!

365
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,416
[YUUKO groans]

366
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,208
[YUUKO]
I don't remember what she said!

367
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,791
Just calm down!
I need to breathe.

368
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,833
If I panic, I won't be
able to think straight!

369
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,458
All right, focus.
What is this thing doing?

370
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,416
Flying? Was that it?

371
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,291
No, it can't be.

372
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,291
This little guy
is so distracting!

373
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,583
Why can't I stop focusing
on this monster?

374
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,458
Wait, monster?

375
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,625
This isn't just testing
my language skills.

376
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,583
It's testing my sanity.

377
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,625
But this is the best I can do,
so I should just move on.

378
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,833
So what's next?

379
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,541
[screams]

380
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,000
[YUUKO] It's the same monster
swinging a tennis racket!

381
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,416
Which means the first answer
is definitely not monster.

382
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,625
Why is this thing torturing me?

383
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,666
I'll just erase my first
answer and start over.

384
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,000
[YUUKO]
Where is my eraser?

385
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,625
[YUUKO] Every dang thing
in my stupid life sucks!

386
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,125
What do I do now?
This is so bad!

387
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,541
[YUUKO] Do I just have to
live with my mistakes?

388
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,916
[gasps]

389
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,750
[YUUKO]
Mai! You saved me!

390
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,958
I'm so glad we're
friends! Best friends!

391
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,708
[YUUKO]
A sand eraser?

392
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,625
I can't use this!
It'll rip my paper!

393
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,791
That defeats the purpose!

394
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,666
I don't have time
to worry about that!

395
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,375
I need to see if Mai has a--

396
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,375
She went to sleep!

397
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,208
Uh. All right,
ten minutes remaining!

398
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,541
[YUUKO]
My time! It's ticking away!

399
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:38,375
Come on, I gotta calm down.

400
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,750
That's right.

401
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:44,000
I have to relax...
and just clear my mind.

402
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,916
Purge all thought. Be free.

403
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,208
[bell rings]

404
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,708
Okay. And time's up!

405
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,750
[YUUKO]
No!

406
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,500
It's raining.

407
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,208
[YUUKO]
Only in my heart.

408
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:16,666
Good morning, sir!

409
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,291
Yes, good morning!

410
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,041
[STUDENT C] No way!
I just got a love letter!

411
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,708
[STUDENT D]
Are you for real? Who sent it?

412
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,916
[STUDENT C] It says it's
from Tanaka in Class Four!

413
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,375
[STUDENT D]
Come on! Open it already!

414
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,208
[STUDENT C]
Don't rush me!

415
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:35,250
[wheezing]

416
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,833
[DIRT]
I'm a dirt ball.

417
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,333
[IRON BALL]
I'm an iron ball!

418
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,625
[DIRT] I'd tell you a joke,
but none of mine are clean.

419
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,625
[IRON BALL] And I shall
strike when the iron is hot!

420
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,166
Clang-clang!

421
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,000
[DIRT] The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 12.

422
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,458
[IRON BALL]
Look forward to it!

Guess I should go
wake Hakase up.

00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,875
Maybe after breakfast,

00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,208
I could take a quick stroll

Great day for a walk, huh?

14
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,958
Yeah! Even though the forecast
said it would rain.

15
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,708
I thought weather people
were usually right. But maybe,

00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:33,666
they use a numpad to pad

didn't understand it?

24
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,666
Oh well, that's a shame.
It was such a good one.

25
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,458
But maybe I should try something
that's more their speed.

...dozed off there.

175
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,833
Yeah. It's fine.

176
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,791
The word-chain game.

177
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,250
Wanna play?

178
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,541
Mandarin.

179
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,625
Oh. Sorry.

180
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,375
Say that again?

181
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,625
What would that be?

182
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,541
Be.

183
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,958
Be...

184
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,250
Be.

185
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:04,500
Uh, can I just say
any random word?

186
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,041
Eggplant.

187
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,333
[grunting]

188
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,166
[exhales, laughs]

189
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,875
Heh... Heh. Heh.

190
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,458
[laughs]

191
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,625
[BOTH exhale, laugh]

192
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,125
[BOTH laughing]

193
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:48,958
Eggplant!

194
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,791
[MIO laughing]

195
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,000
She's dead!

196
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,750
Help isn't coming!

197
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,250
[BOTH laughing]

198
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,166
[MIO]
Isn't coming!

199
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,750
[MAI]
Guess I'll die.

200
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,333
[laughing continues]

201
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,708
[DAIKU groans]

202
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,416
It looks like the club is down
to just you and me again.

203
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,875
We'll have to disband if we
can't find a third member

204
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,958
to join us sometime soon.
If only we could make the club

205
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,708
more appealing to
recruit more members.

206
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,083
--Question.
--[DAIKU] Huh?

207
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,583
[SEKIGUCHI]
What do we even do in this club?

208
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,166
Oh, right!

209
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,750
That's what we have to figure
out to make us more appealing!

210
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,000
We kinda don't do anything.

211
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,791
[MIO]
On your mark...

212
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,708
Get set...

213
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,166
[MIO]
Go!

214
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,208
[YUUKO grunts]

215
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,500
[FEMALE VOICE]
Helvetica Standard.

216
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,208
[CROWD cheering]

217
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,125
[SEKI]
Hey! Cut it out, dude!

218
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,833
Let go of my jersey!

219
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,916
[GOTO]
Come on, bro, just relax!

220
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,250
Lemme take it off for you!

221
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,750
[SEKI]
I can't do that, dude!

222
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,875
I didn't score at all today!
Not a single point!

223
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,208
It's fine, bro! It's not
like you'll need this

224
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,250
old uniform after
you retire anyway!

225
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,750
[SEKI]
Just hear me out, dude!

226
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,458
My uniform won't
be worth anything

227
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,166
if I'm a player that's
never scored!

228
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,625
[GOTO]
That's not true, bro!

229
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,916
You inspired me to play ball
and that's worth it to me!

230
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,416
[SEKI] All right, dude,
all right, fine, I'll do it!

231
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,416
I can take if off myself!

232
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,458
Just like, uh, let me
go so I can do it!

233
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,541
[GOTO]
Uhh...

234
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,458
All right, ya got me.

235
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,791
Psych!

236
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,250
[GOTO]
Hey uh, sorry, bro.

237
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,583
[SAKAMOTO]
Listen up!

238
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,208
I'm gonna remind you again that
you need to respect your elders.

239
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,791
'Kay...

240
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,708
[SAKAMOTO] As always,
she can be such a pawful.

241
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,875
Hm? Oh!

242
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,500
[SAKAMOTO grunts]

243
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,916
[SAKAMOTO]
Oh, man, this is too fun!

244
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,500
C'mere tail!

245
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,291
[DAIKU] At first, I wanted
to make a sport that captured

246
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,416
the best parts of
Go and Soccer.

247
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,541
So... That's why I
made a club for it.

248
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,416
[DAIKU]
But...

249
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,250
I got nothin'.

250
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,166
[HAKASE]
Draw a boomerang shape.

251
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,125
Then a triangle shape,
then a rectangle shape.

252
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,333
Hakase! It's time to go to bed!

253
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,750
[HAKASE]
'Kay!

254
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,625
[NANO growls] You weren't
just eating snacks were you?

255
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,250
I didn't eat any snacks.

256
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,000
[NANO] Why are you
looking to the side?

257
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,208
I'll look the other
way to even it out.

258
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,791
[NANO]
That doesn't make sense.

259
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,000
[NANO]
Ah-ha! See!

260
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,708
Why are you snacking
after I told you not to?

261
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,083
I, uh, wasn't the one
who ate those snacks!

262
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,291
If you didn't eat them,

263
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,125
why do you have crumbs
all over your face?

264
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,250
[gasps]

265
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,125
[HAKASE coughs]
I think I've caught a cold.

266
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,916
[NANO]
Enough! I'm not playing around!

267
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,333
When I say no, it means no!
And you're not listening!

268
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,416
Not one bit!

269
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,750
It's not my fault!

270
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,458
Sakamoto forced me to eat
all of the yummy snacks!

271
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,916
[laughs] He's got a little
snot bubble. That's gross.

272
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,958
[NANO]
Don't try to change the subject!

273
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,875
[NANO] Jeez. You need remember
to brush your teeth before bed.

274
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,708
I already brushed 'em!

275
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:19,500
Huh? Did you brush them again
after you had snacks?

276
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,708
I did. Extra good.

277
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,208
[NANO] What are you
so embarrassed about?

278
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,416
[HAKASE]
It's fine!

279
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,375
Brushing once a night
is all I need to do!

280
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,125
No, it's not! You brush
after you eat.

281
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,458
Well, did you brush
after my snack?!

282
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,375
I don't have to. I didn't eat!

283
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,500
Uh! Then, uh...

284
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,708
[NANO] I'm all ready to go
to bed, and you're not.

285
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,708
Now go brush before
you get cavities.

286
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,208
[HAKASE grumbles, sniffs]

287
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,166
You're a robot, so you
can't even get cavities!

288
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,250
[NANO gasping]

289
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,583
[HAKASE]
Ah! Wait, uh!

290
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:57,833
I mean, um, that I just, uh.
Maybe you can get a tiny cavity.

291
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,166
Can I really?

292
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,041
Uh, yeah sure.

293
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,041
[NANO]
Uhh! You're lying.

294
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,041
[HAKASE]
Oh! But you can still

295
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,375
get other grody
stuff, like rust!

296
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,125
--[NANO] I'll rust.
--[HAKASE] Okay, uh!

297
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,916
I'll add a feature that
lets you get cavities!

298
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,791
I promise! It'll be
the best feature ever!

299
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,291
Do you really swear?

300
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:23,125
[gasps] You can count on me!

301
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,458
[HAKASE]
Come on, Nano!

302
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,291
Let's go and brush
our teeth again!

303
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,083
[NANO] Okay. But you know
I don't have to, right?

304
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,875
[HAKASE]
Whoa! It's already ten o'clock!

305
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:35,791
[NANO]
It sure is.

306
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,041
[HAKASE]
Today was a blast!

307
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,458
[NANO]
Yeah, yeah.

308
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,666
[HAKASE]
I had so much fun!

309
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,541
[MISATO]
Man.

310
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:24,666
I wish Sasahara would just take
things seriously for once.

311
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,000
[YOLK A] We're a double-yolk
egg! Like twins!

312
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,166
[YOLK B]

313
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,125
[YOLK A]
Ow! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

314
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,583
[YOLK B]
Hot! It's hot!

315
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:46,083
Th-The next episode of

316
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,750
Ouch! Look forward
to-- Ah, ah, hot!

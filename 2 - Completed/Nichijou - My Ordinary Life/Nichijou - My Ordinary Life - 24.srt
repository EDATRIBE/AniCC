00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,958
I have to know!

--[MIO] Yuuko!
--[YUUKO screams]

181
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,916
I was just about to
think of a topic!

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Tell me what happened

183
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,166
between those two
in the courtyard!

184
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,958
[groans] Will you
stop yelling at me?

185
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:12,833
Let's see.

186
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,166
They were, uh...

187
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,791
You're useless!

188
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,541
[MIO] Fine then!
I'll have to find out myself!

189
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,750
I'll go to the
Courtyard of Eden!

190
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,708
[NANO]
Thank you again for your help.

191
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,666
It was my pleasure.

192
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,833
Farewell.

193
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,083
[MIO groans]

194
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,916
Huh? Mio, are you okay?

195
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,208
Why are you on the floor?

196
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,083
[MIO]
Nano.

197
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,500
Yes?

198
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,916
I heard that you were
eating <i>yakisoba</i> bread

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,833
with Koujirou out
in the courtyard.

200
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,208
And who is Koujirou? Uh--

201
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,375
Uh--oh, you mean that guy?

202
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,583
All he did was help me pick up

203
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,333
one of the books
I dropped earlier.

204
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,291
And that's it?

205
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,333
Yup. That's all that happened.

206
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,916
[MIO] But... what happened
to the <i>yakisoba</i> bread?

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Huh? What are you talking about?

208
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,583
[YUUKO sighs]

209
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,666
[FEMALE VOICE]
Helvetica Standard.

210
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,750
Hey!

211
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,041
Come on, you can trust me!

212
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,416
Just tell me who you like, Yumi!

213
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,625
Aww.

214
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,916
I dunno if I should.

215
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,166
I won't tell anybody,

216
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,416
but if I do, I'll give
ya a million yen! 'Kay?

217
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,625
All right.

218
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,291
But you better not tell
anyone, you promise?

219
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,250
Yeah, totes! [giggles]

220
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,583
It's Takashi.

221
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,000
[EMI]
Hey, everyone, listen up!

222
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,541
Yumi just told me that
she likes Takashi!

223
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,833
[NAKAMURA]
Fascinating.

224
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:03,666
[KENDO CLASS yelling]

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,291
--[MISATO] Ha!
--[YOSHINO] Head!

226
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,041
[MISATO sighs]

227
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,125
Thank you for all
your help today.

228
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,458
[YOSHINO giggles]
Take this.

229
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,416
Huh?

230
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,458
[MIHOSHI]
That stupid prodigy!

231
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,458
[MIHOSHI] It's so rare for you
stop by the dojo nowadays.

232
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,750
With the competition coming up,

233
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,208
it's good to get
some extra lessons

234
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,666
with our instructor
outside of school,

235
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,083
so I can be ready.

236
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,291
And having Yoshino there

237
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,416
also helps out with my
training a lot, too.

238
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,916
You're lucky, because she
usually never shows up.

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,541
What? She doesn't?

240
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,416
She told me she actually
starts to get worse

241
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,625
the harder she trains.

242
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,791
Like some kendo freak
of nature. [groans]

243
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,125
So, if you don't learn from her,

244
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,166
who do you normally
get your lessons from?

245
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,750
The instructor.

246
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,666
And Sasahara has also been
coming to the dojo a lot lately.

247
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,750
[MISATO]
Hmm.

248
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,291
[gasps] Sasahara?!

249
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,125
Since when does he
go to the dojo?

250
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,541
Since always?

251
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,333
He was going there throughout
all of middle school,

252
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,875
so it's really nothing new.

253
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,458
Yeah, but, well, I...
I guess that's true.

254
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,708
I don't get why you're
making such a big deal.

255
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,291
Aren't you in the
same kendo club?

256
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,416
The one at school!

257
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,875
No, we are not!

258
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,333
He's been in the drama club
ever since his first year.

259
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,208
[MIHOSHI]
Hmm?

260
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,875
Wha?!

261
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,750
He's part of the drama club?

262
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,458
Why isn't he in the kendo club?

263
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,000
How the heck am I
supposed to know?

264
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,458
If you take a weird guy like him

265
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,875
out of something
cool like kendo,

266
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,208
all you're left with
is a weird dude!

267
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,041
[MISATO] You don't know
Sasahara like I do,

268
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,916
'cause you've only ever
seen him at the dojo.

269
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,583
[MIHOSHI]
What do you mean?

270
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,875
[MISATO] I mean that his
performances in the drama club

271
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,250
are a bit out there,

272
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,541
but they're honestly pretty
unique and interesting.

273
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,916
[KOUJIROU] Don't be silly.
This is grape juice.

274
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,833
[MIHOSHI]
I guess I can imagine that.

275
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,000
[MISATO]
So, you get it?

276
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,500
What I don't get is
why you haven't just

277
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,541
invited him to
the kendo club yet.

278
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,791
It's such a waste!

279
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,250
What?

280
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,333
Why do I have to be the one
to invite him to the club?

281
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,875
I don't think about him.
He can do whatever he wants.

282
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,250
But I bet you guys could totally

283
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,291
make it to nationals
together with his help!

284
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,625
Don't hold your breath.

285
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,541
He ran off and joined that
stupid little drama club

286
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,916
of his own accord.

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,916
Who cares? I don't! That idiot!

288
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,958
But if you insist...

289
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,500
There's no need to twist my arm.

290
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,208
Maybe I can invite
him for your sake.

291
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,750
[MIHOSHI]
Oh, wow.

292
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,250
I can read her like a book.

293
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,500
--So?
--[MIHOSHI] Huh?

294
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,333
When does Sasahara
come to the dojo?

295
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,166
Uh--

296
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,166
Well, he stops by every
three days or so,

297
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,666
so I get the feeling that he'll
probably be there tomorrow.

298
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,750
[MISATO]
Mm...

299
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,375

It's not like I care.

[MISATO]
What?

303
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,791
You should just confess your
feelings to him already!

304
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,625
I don't wanna hear it from
someone younger than me!

305
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,916
I'm going home!

00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:02,791

You need finish those green
onions you flicked to the side!

322
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,416
I think it's still
a bit too early

323
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,541
for me to eat green
onions right now.

324
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,375
What is that supposed to mean?

325
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,916
Regardless,

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,166
you should finish every bit
of food that's on your plate.

327
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,708
But the green stuff
is always bitter,

328
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,416
and gross, and weird,
and whatever.

329
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,458
[NANO groans]
If you don't finish your food,

330
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,166
then you don't get
snacks tomorrow.

331
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,666
Just look at Sakamoto
and follow his example.

332
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,333
He eats his food
no matter what--

I'll sleep it off--[sneezes]

You'll have a hard time
recovering if you don't eat.

340
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,041
Can you at least give it a try?

341
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,708
[SAKAMOTO]
I think I'll pass.

342
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,375
[NANO] Would it help
if I got you some milk?

343
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,625
[SAKAMOTO]
Don't think so.

344
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,500
[NANO]
Then I'm at a loss.

345
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,625
Do you feel like eating
anything at all?

346
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,875
[SAKAMOTO]
Not really.

347
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,958
I don't even wanna
think about it.

348
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,208
Oh, no.

349
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,416

you can have my green onions.

350

00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,041
Ooh.

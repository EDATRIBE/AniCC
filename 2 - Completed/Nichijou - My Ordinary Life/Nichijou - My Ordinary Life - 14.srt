Hey, be careful over
there, Sakamoto!

[NANO] I wouldn't want
you getting your hair

a lot lately.

[SAKAMOTO] I see how it is.
I'm just in the way now.

[SAKAMOTO]
Uh, well, yeah!

16
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,000
It was made based on
your measurements,

17
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,375
so of course it fits!

You look pretty good, I guess.

That's not what I meant at all!

21

um... look normal?

[SAKAMOTO]
Sure.

00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,458
I suppose you look like
any other school girl.

Oh, hey, Nano.

cream after school?

Uh. Yeah. That sounds wonderful.

00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,333
Great! How about we
go sing karaoke, too?

36
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,083
Huh? Really?

37
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,958
Well, um. Maybe.

38
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,583
I've never done that before!

00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,791
Don't worry! I'll show you how!
Come on, everyone's going!

Oh. In that case, okay.

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,458
Wouldn't that be amazing?

Oh, Hakase! Good morning!

Look at how well
the uniform fits me!

Do I look all right?

cool in your pajamas!

same thing all the time.

You're forgetting something.

62
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,291
Huh? Am I really?

63
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,375
What'll you do if you're hungry?

Grab a Snickers!

Good thinkin'!

66
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,375
I left some food in
the kitchen for you.

67
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,125
There should be enough
for breakfast and lunch.

68
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,000
And I'll take care of the
laundry later today,

69
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,833
so make sure to gather the
clothes you want washed

70
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,750
before I get home from school.

71
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,375
Okay, but what time will you
be getting out of school?

72
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,666
Well, it ends around
3:30, I think.

73
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,500
But I'll need to do some
shopping for dinner

74
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,708
on the way back,

75
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,666
so I should be home by
5:00, at the latest.

76
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,833
At 5:00?

77
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,000
What's up? Did I forget
to tell you that?

board with it a second ago.

to go! You can't go!

late for school!

worried there for a second,

but thankfully, I was
able to convince her.

slipped my mind!

Don't be silly. That's
a fake game I made up.

173
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,958
It's not like it's supposed
to be a real sport.

174
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,583
See, this club is pretty much
just about relaxing inside

175
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,083
and playing a few random
games every once in a while.

176
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,500
Kinda like a recreational
thing. Know what I mean?

177
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,708
Sure.

178
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,791
[DAIKU]
Hm?

179
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,208
The thing is,

180
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,750
I was actually in a Go+Soccer
club in middle school.

181
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,958
[DAIKU]
Uh?

182
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,916
And I had absolutely
no idea there would be

183
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,916
a Go+Soccer club in
high school, too.

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,541
But then I saw those banners

185
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,958
hanging on front
of the building.

186
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,916
So I had to find
the club and join!

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,416
And not to brag, but I was the
MVP of my middle school club!

188
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:04,291
[DAIKU yells]

189
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,666
Uh, Miss Shinonome?

190
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,916
Oh. Yes?

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,666
Oh, I just... I was just
curious about something.

192
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,583
Uh, that thing on your back.

193
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,000
Uh! It's.... Uh, well.

194
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,166
Huh? Right. Yeah, no. Uh.

195
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,750
--[NANO] Um. This is-- Uh!
--[IZUMI] Well, I mean. Um!

196
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,500
[SEKIGUCHI] So then, if
Go+Soccer is a real sport,

197
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,875
how do you play?

198
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,375
Well, it can be
kinda complicated,

199
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,500
so it'd be better if I show you.

200
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,041
Here. I'll give you a
little demonstration.

201
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,333
First off is the lifting.

202
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,500
[MAKOTO]
After lifting, its Go stones!

203
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,041
[MAKOTO]
And then you go into...

204
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,875
...a solo suplex!

205
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,125
[BOTH grunt]

206
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,083
And that's the
avalanche <i>joseki</i> !

207
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,958
Three Star Point!

208
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,416
[DAIKU]
That was incredible.

209
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,541
I never thought this club would
go anywhere when I started it.

210
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:12,750
But now, it's way cooler
than I ever imagined!

211
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,333
[barking]

212
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,708
[KIYOSHI]
Hey, wait up!

213
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,791
Where the heck do you think
you're running off to?

214
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,583
Buddy! Come back!

215
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,500
[yelps]

216
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,583
Sakamoto! C'mere!
C'mere! C'mere!

217
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,500
[SAKAMOTO] Hey! Are you
crazy?! Cut that out!

218
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:55,166
[WORD-TIME NARRATOR] If asked
what it is, it is spinning.

219
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,708
That's what I told him.

220
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,416
Yeah, you see what I mean, bro?

221
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,833
Hey, let's go!

222
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,750
[sighs]

223
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,708
I told you we'd
make it back early.

224
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,208
[NANO] I can't believe I messed
everything up on my first day.

225
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,375
Everyone probably
thinks I'm crazy.

226
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,666
[MIO] Oh, hey, Nano, did you
bring your own lunch?

227
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,375
Uh, yeah, I did.

228
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,125
It looks really tasty.

229
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,875
So, do you pack one every day?

230
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,958
Yes, I do!

231
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,750
Like a normal girl.

232
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,166
[NANO]
Hm?

233
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,125
You can look at this.

234
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,083
Wow. It is pretty cool.

235
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,458
Thank you!

236
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,625
Oh, hells yeah.
I'm right on time.

237
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,416
[MIO]
Uh, no. You're crazy late.

238
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,166
Lunch break is
almost over already.

239
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,416
I'm sorry!

240
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,416
My shoes flew off while
I was on my way back,

241
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,166
and they got stolen
by a car and a dog,

242
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,958
so it was a real pain
to get 'em back.

243
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,208
[MIO]
Huh?

244
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,083
That sounds fake, but
also kinda interesting.

245
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,625
I totally wanna hear
the whole story later.

246
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,000
But right now, I'm just glad
you made it here all right.

247
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,250
Hang on. Where's your lunch?

248
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,291
[YUUKO]
Hm?

249
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,916
I ate it while I was
on the way back.

250
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,583
[MIO]
Huh? What'd you have?

251
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,500
A twice-cooked pork lunch box.

252
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,166
[MIO]
Whoa! How did you even--?

253
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,958
Ugh. Never mind.

254
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:52,083
Anyway, did you wanna eat lunch
with the three of us, Nano?

255
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,666
[NANO gasps]

256
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,041
I'd really like to hang out with
you and get to know you better.

257
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,166
Um, okay.

258
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,791
[NANO]
Maybe I didn't freak them out

259
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,666
and they think I'm
normal after all.

260
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,041
Maybe I can even
make some friends!

261
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,583
Oh, hey, what's with that
strange key thing on your back?

262
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,541
Uh! Uhh...

263
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,666
It's definitely
nothing suspicious

264
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,291
if that's what you're
asking! So, uh...

265
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,208
You aren't actually like
some weird robot girl

266
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,291
or something, are ya?

267
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,500
[screams]

268
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,500
Don't be ridiculous, Yuuko.

269
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,416
Sorry, she can be kinda dense.

270
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,583
Oh, we're almost out of time.

271
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,916
Sorry, Nano. Let's have
lunch together tomorrow.

272
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,375
Let's see.

273
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,583
[KATASHINA] There's no way
they're gonna believe that!

274
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,041
[MIO]
Uh...

275
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,208
[NAKANOJOU]
No, seriously.

276
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,250
I climbed the entire mountain
looking for her, and by the...

277
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,583
Hey, Yuuko, what did you get me?

278
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,791
[YUUKO]
Hm? I got the <i>yakisaba</i> .

279
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,291
...but she's just
an urban legend.

280
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,291
Could you repeat that
one more time, please?

281
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,166
Uh. <i>Yakisaba</i> , right?

282
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,875
I said <i>yakisoba</i> !

283
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:01,791
[gasps]

284
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,625
Oh. Well...

285
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,125
I guess I heard you wrong and
got you a different thing.

286
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,166
Yeah, that's my bad.

287
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,625
Don't act like it's
not a big deal!

288
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,166
I asked for noodles and
you gave me a fried fish!

289
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,500
But can you blame me?

290
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,541
Those two names
sound so similar.

291
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,000
That's not the--

292
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,500
Uh.

293
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,000
[groans]

294
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,250
Whatever. I give up.

295
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,250
Just give me my rice.

296
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,250
[YUUKO]
Hm?

297
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,291
What rice?

298
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,791
The rice that comes
with the fish!

299
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,458
Oh. Yeah, no,
it's just the fish.

300
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,416
How am I supposed to
eat this by itself?!

301
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,458
Huh? But you didn't
clarify when you asked

302
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,000
for the <i>yakisaba</i>
in the first place.

303
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,833
I asked for <i>yakisoba</i> !

304
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,250
<i>Yaki</i> ! <i>Soba</i> !
They're noodles!

305
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,583
'Kay. I get it now.

306
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,916
On the bright side,

307
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,625
you could post this whole
story on social media

308
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,125
and I bet it'll be hilarious.

309
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,416
I don't own a computer!

310
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,958
Aww. Well, it's not my fault

311
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,291
you're missing out on a
chance to score some likes.

312
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,041
All right, fine. I'll run out
again and get you your food.

313
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,583
I just need money.

314
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,375
Why should I be the one who
has to pay for your mistakes?

315
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,291
'Cause I don't have
any money left on me.

316
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,583
Uh?

317
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,958
Okay, fine. Just hurry up
and come back quick.

318
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,916
We hardly have any time left.

319
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,916
[YUUKO]
You can count on me!

320
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,500
[MIO]
That's all I have.

321
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,208
[YUUKO]
Wha--?

322
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,041
One peso is all I have!

323
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,791
I can't believe the only
money in my wallet

324
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,833
is this peso I kept
as a souvenir.

325
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,000
[YUUKO]
Huh?

326
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,166
[MIO] What can I do
with a single peso?

327
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,500
[YUUKO]
One peso?

328
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't know!

329
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,166
You're the one who caused
this mess in the first place!

330
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,541
You should be the
one to pay for it!

331
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,916
[YUUKO]
I already spent all my money

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,583
when I bought my lunch,
so I don't have any more.

333
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,000
And what am I supposed
to do about my lunch?

334
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:38,083
Well, I guess...
you could eat...

335
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:38,916
...the mackerel.

336
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,458
Mackerel?! Ugh!

337
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,625
You're just a never-ending
cycle of pissing me off!

338
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,250
And I'm sick of letting you
copy my homework every day!

339
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,666
Why don't you just do it
by yourself for a change?!

340
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,833
You idiot!

341
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,375
I understand that you're upset,

342
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,083
but the fact that I'm an idiot
has absolutely nothing to do

343
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,708
with me getting your
lunch order wrong.

344
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,916
[MIO]
It has everything to do with it!

345
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,583
Yeah? I'd like to hear why!

346
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,916
Only an idiot would
mishear me like that!

347
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,875
Hmph.

348
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,000
Everyone's guilty of making

349
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,625
a few mistakes
sometimes, ya know!

350
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,291
But you just have to overreact!
It's not the end of the world!

351
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,041
[MIO] I didn't eat breakfast,
so I needed that lunch

352
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,458
to keep me from
starving all day!

353
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,541
I wouldn't expect an idiot
like you to understand!

354
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,958
I'm not an idiot!

355
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,041
[MIO] You just said you
were an idiot earlier!

356
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, and FYI, I'm never letting
you copy my homework ever again,

357
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,333
so good luck!

358
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,916
Yeah, that's fine! But
this is a two-way street!

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,166
If I can't copy your homework,
then you can't copy mine either!

360
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,416
Why would I wanna copy your
homework in the first place?

361
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,291
Your answers would be as
wrong as my lunch order!

362
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,375
Which you never apologized
for, by the way!

363
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,666
So get on your knees and
apologize right now!

364
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,750
Fine, if that's what
you really want,

365
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,083
I guess I should just
bend over then!

366
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,416
How's that?

367
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,041
This good enough for you,
Miss Perfect Hearing?

368
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,291
There's my apology!
Are you happy now?! Are ya?!

369
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,916
What?! You call that weird
pose you did a bow?

370
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,750
No! It wasn't a bow because
I was just stretching!

371
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,791
And I'm never gonna
bow to you! Fool!

372
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,333
Why can't you just admit
that you messed up?

373
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,916
[YUUKO]
Because you pissed me off!

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,291
Also, calling me an idiot
would make you a hypocrite.

375
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,166
Did you remember those
weird doodles you drew?

376
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,916
'Cause I do!

377
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
[MIO gasps]

378
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,291
[MIO]
Wait, the doodles were, uh...

379
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,166
You moron, those were just--

380
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,416
[YUUKO]
What were they?

381
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,000
Go ahead and tell me!

382
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,166
I'm an idiot, so I won't get it
unless you spell it out for me!

383
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:15,916
Go ahead!

384
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,541
You moron!

385
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,458
You're a complete
and utter moron!

386
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,875
[YUUKO]
Ugh! Who's the moron?!

387
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,791
Only a real moron would
draw these weird sketches

388
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,958
and leave them out in the open!

389
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,000
[MIO screams]

390
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,625
Come on, I want you
to taste defeat!

391
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,166
Eat it along with
this <i>yakisaba</i> !

392
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,750
I wanted <i>yakisoba</i> !

393
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,208
Would you apologize already?

394
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,958
Get down on your
knobby knees right now!

395
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,291
[YUUKO]
I apologized earlier!

396
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,833
Was that not good
enough for you?

397
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,625
Apologize like you mean it,
or you're just a waste of space!

398
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,125
[YUUKO]
All right, fine!

399
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,041
I'll show you the ultimate
bow to end all bows!

400
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,666
Behold its glory!

401
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,333
The one true bow!

402
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,750
[MIO] Hmph. I see the bow,
but I don't hear an apology!

403
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,666
What are you sorry for? Tell me!

404
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,125
Say that you're sorry
for messing up my order!

405
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,375
Say it!

406
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,041
Say that you're an idiot
that messes things up!

407
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,375
And you're just a
useless human being

408
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,750
that can't get anything right!

409
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,208
Come on! I'm waiting!
Do it already!

410
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,708
Are you not listening?

411
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,041
Apologize, you moron!

412
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,416
Worthless! Idiot! Moron!

413
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,583
[yells]

414
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,041
[NANO screams]

415
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,833
[growling]

416
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,708
[BOTH scream]

417
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,333
I'm sick and tired of you
constantly calling me a moron!

418
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,416
You don't even know me!

419
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,791
We've only been
friends for like, what,

420
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,125
six lousy months now?

421
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,416
I could say the same about you!

422
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,166
You don't understand
me or my drawings!

423
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,333
I do understand!

424
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,875
Your drawings are so good

425
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,083
that you might as well become
a professional manga artist!

426
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,250
Uh! What are you talking about?
Stop being stupid, stupid.

427
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,750
Huh?

428
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,291
Well, if I'm stupid, then
you're stupid, too, so suck it!

429
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,083
You just called yourself stupid.

430
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,416
[YUUKO]
I did not!

431
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,333
But you did!

432
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:59,416
But that stupid side of
you isn't all that bad.

433
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,041
What are you saying?
You've got the good side!

434
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:11,416
Uh. Hey, you stop it now,
with your positive energy.

435
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,333
Well, I think you're way too
talented at drawing art things!

436
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,166
Shut up! You run too fast!

437
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,291
Well, you're too smart!

438
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,583
[MIO]
Well, you're optimistic!

439
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,750
You're a great person!

440
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,916
[MIO]
You're a super fun person!

441
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,375
[NANO gasps]

442
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,625
[NANO]
Amazing!

443
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,125
[TAKASAKI]
Captain! I'm sorry. We tried!

444
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,791
[SENPAI A] Save your tears.
We always have next year.

445
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,416
[TAKASAKI]
I'll win it! I'll win for him!

446
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,833
Woohoo!

447
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,250
[TAKASAKI]
Those were the days.

448
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,000
[HAKASE]
Hey, Nano,

449
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,791
did you have fun on
your very first day?

450
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,041
[NANO]
I sure did.

451
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,541
So many things happened.
It was kinda like...

452
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,958
Oo, like what? Tell me about it!

453
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,375
I love having friends!

454
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,375
It's the greatest feeling
in the whole world!

455
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,750
[gasps]

456
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,250
That sounds amazing!

457
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,083
[SAKAMOTO] Come on. You're
both getting too excited.

458
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,541
Huh? One of these?

459
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,916
Hakase!

460
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,791
Please take this key
off of my back!

461
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,625
Uh...

462
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,458
No way.

463
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,208
[NANO]
Huh? But why not?

464
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,541
It's having a negative impact
on my life at school!

465
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,291
People are already
starting to suspect

466
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,000
that I might really be a robot!

467
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,708
And that makes it harder
for me to make friends.

468
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,166
[HAKASE] You can to make
friends. Your key is pretty.

469
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,375
[NANO]
I don't think it is.

470
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,375
[HAKASE]
But it's cute. And it's a key.

471
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,791
[NANO]
But why?

472
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,458
[SAKAMOTO] Just hurry up
and give me my food.

473
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,416
[SOCCER BALL A]
It's soccer ball here.

474
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,375
All I do is get kicked around,
day in and day out.

475
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,541
Kicked and crushed until I
deflate and get put to rest!

476
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,291
I don't even have goals!

477
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,250
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 15.

478
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,958
Look forward to it!

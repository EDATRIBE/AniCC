00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,333
Though I'm sure the cold
will come to a head for me

178
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,791
before it does for you.

179
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,041
[PRINCIPAL laughs]

180
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,541
So please take care that
you don't catch a cold.

181
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,000
After all,

182
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,958
it is my duty as principal
to watch over you students.

183
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,500
But if you neglect to
take my advice to heart,

184
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,333
and you do catch a cold,
well... I'd say you might have

185
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,958
forgotten to respect your
principal's principles.

186
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,375
[PRINCIPAL laughs]

187
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,041
Can I ask you something, Mio?

188
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,291
Make it quick.

189
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,875
We'll get in trouble if
they catch us talking.

190
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,458
Do you think the principal knows
that none of his jokes are funny

191
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,250
to anyone but himself?
It's pretty obvious, right?

192
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,500
You'd think he would take
the hint when no one laughs,

193
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,875
like ever, but it seems like

194
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,416
he's just in his own little
world most of the time.

195
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,625
[MIO] Hm. I never really
thought about it.

196
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,666
[YUUKO]
But wait!

197
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,250
What if he does know
he's not funny,

198
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,750
and he's just trying to
teach the younger,

199
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,750
lazier generation the
importance of persistence?

200
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,250
Possibly.

201
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,916
If that's the case, then the
principal might actually be

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,666
some manipulative mastermind!

203
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,750
[gasps]

204
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,625
--[MAI laughs]
--[YUUKO] Mai?

205
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,000
[laughing]

206
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,375
What's her deal?

207
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,375
Don't tell me she's laughing
at those terrible jokes!

208
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,916
Huh?!

209
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,458
[YUUKO] I've never seen Mai
crack up this much before!

210
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,625
She's totally busting her gut!

211
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,666
All right! Here's my chance!

212
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,166
Hey, Mai!

213
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,375
[YUUKO] I can't do it! I want
to tell my own lame joke,

214
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,250
but it'll be too
embarrassing for me!

215
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,166
Yuuko?

216
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,708
[gasps] Huh?

217
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:22,125
[MAI]
Sorry. Never mind. It's nothing.

218
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,708
[MAI] I think...
I won't say anything.

219
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,250
I'll just leave it where it is.

220
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,833
[MAI laughs]

221
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,791
Next on the docket, we have
a necessary message

222
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:48,166
from the student counselor,
Ms. Sakurai. You can step up

223
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,875
to the microphone
whenever you're ready.

224
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,083
Umm, I think it's your turn.

225
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,500
It is?!

226
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,291
Excuse me!

227
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,125
I'm Ms. Sakurai,
your student counselor.

228
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,666
But umm. I-I guess you
knew that already.

229
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,208
[IZUMI]
Oh man.

230
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,208
It's so nerve-wracking to be
in front of such a big crowd.

231
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,958
No, I've got to
pull it together!

232
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,458
It's my job to be a model
teacher for my students,

233
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,041
and myself! I'm going
to go ahead and say

234
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,458
what needs to be said!

235
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,833
All right! I've noticed
that there have been some

236
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,375
goats on the school
grounds recently.

237
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,500
Please try your best
to not bring any goats

238
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,958
to school with you
if you can help it.

239
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,416
[SASAHARA]
Goats, you say?

240
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,708
And what is so bad about goats?

241
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,958
[CROWD]
Huh?

242
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,833
I've read the school policies.

243
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:38,500
Nowhere does it say that we
can't bring a goat to class!

244
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,958
Um, well. That's uh...

245
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,250
[YUUKO] Yo, Mio. Was that
Koujirou screaming about goats?

246
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,333
What? Goats, where?

247
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,791
[IZUMI]
Mm... Then.

248
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,541
I guess goats
are perfectly fine!

249
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,666
[SASAHARA]
Hmph.

250
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,541
[CROWD gasps]

251
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,500
Like hell your goats are fine!
You don't get to make that call!

252
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,250
Even if it's not in the school's
rules, it's still weird!

253
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,708
Duly noted.
But consider this, Misato.

254
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,250
Why should someone like me
be forced to hobble to school

255
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,750
with my own two legs?

256
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,750
I am the eldest son of the
Sasahara household, you know.

257
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,041
I don't give a damn about
your Sasahara household!

258
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,166
You guys are a buncha
normal farmers!

259
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,375
Regardless, that does
not change the fact that

260
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,291
I am the eldest son
of the family.

261
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,625
For real?

262
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,541
Koujirou comes from a family
of ordinary farmers?

263
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,416
And here I thought he was
the greatest of all time.

264
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,958
[MIO] That means the white
goat I saw at the bike rack

265
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,958
must have belonged to Koujirou.

266
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,208
I can just imagine him
riding majestically

267
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,416
atop that beautiful steed
and whisking me away.

268
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,291
A happy new year to me!

269
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,250
[gasps] I do.

270
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,416
[YUUKO]
Whoa!

271
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,583
Uh!

272
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,083
Uh. Also, make sure you
don't use your cellphones

273
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,750
while riding your bikes.
It's extremely dangerous!

274
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,000
And now finally...

275
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,250
I discovered this Buddha
statue that someone put in

276
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,291
my shoe locker this morning.
I just wanted to point out

277
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,333
that pranks like these
are unacceptable!

278
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,583
Excuse us! Coming through!

279
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,000

Ah! Gosh, Mai! Don't stop
like that without warning!

[MAI] There it is again. So
this is what déjà vu feels like.

282
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,750
Uh. Who put this
inside my locker?

283
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,333
I promise I won't be angry
if you own up to it.

284
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,708
We can stand here all day

285
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,916
until someone raises
their hand and confesses.

birthday through the grapevine,

get you something.

294
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,583
[PRINCIPAL] Ah, I guess I know
now that a Buddha statue

295
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,625
doesn't exactly
make a great gift.

296
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,125
So. It seems as though

297
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,166
one thought it would be
good to give a present.

298
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,333
But a Buddha statue
is not so pleasant.

nothing happened.

Don't forget the mister.

349
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,250
All right, Mister, I'd actually
prefer it if you'd call him

350
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,166
"Koujirou Sasahara,"
and not simply "goat."

351
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,416
[slurping]

352
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,666
Think I'm gonna
stick with "goat."

353
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,791
[NANO]
My name is Nano Shinonome.

354
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,541
I'm just your average robot,

355
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,791
and I live at home
with my creator, Hakase.

356
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,291
[NANO] Hakase spends every
single day inside the house

357
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,875
doing all sorts of really
important research.

358
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,458
And I spend those days
by helping her out

359
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,666
in any way that I can.

360
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,500
Hakase!

361
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,958
I brought you that warm
milk you asked for--

362
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,083
[NANO gasps]

363
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,291
[NANO] I don't have
any special features,

364
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,041
but apparently I'm a robot
that can feel pain.

365
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,708
[HAKASE]
Nano? What's the matter?

366
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,000
Hakase! I stubbed my toe!
The little one!

367
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,666
[HAKASE]
No!

368
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,875
But pinky is the littlest
piggy of them all!

369
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:13,916
[gasps]

370
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,958
There, I fixed it.
You should feel better now.

371
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,166
[screams]

372
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,958
[NANO] I don't have
any special features,

373
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,666
but apparently my pinky
toe comes off?

374
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,625
Could you tell me what
the key on my back's for?

375
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,041
Oh? Have I never
wound it up for you?

376
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,250
[NANO]
No, you haven't.

377
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,833
But it spins on its
own sometimes.

378
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,708
[HAKASE] Give it a little
twisty-twist, and...

379
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,333
[NANO gasps]
What's going on?

380
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,166
[whistling]

381
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,375
[gasps]

382
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,041
[laughing]

383
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,208
[NANO]
I take it back.

384
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,458
I have all sorts
of special features.

385
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,583
Ya see? Pretty cool, huh?

386
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,833
So, that's it?

387
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,208
That's the only reason
I have a key on my back?

388
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,083
That's right!

389
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,958
It really has no additional
features other than that?

390
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:03,833
You got it!

391
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,125
Can you take it off?

392
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:05,958
No!

393
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,166
[NANO gasping]

394
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,000
I wanna leave it on
'cause it looks cute.

395
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,875
[NANO] But I'd really
like it if you took it off.

396
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,708
Aww, it's so cute though.

397
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,458
I just wish that I could be
more like a normal human.

398
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,333
I'd like to sit in a chair
without having to twist weird.

399
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,000
And be able to roll over
in bed when I sleep.

400
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,083
[STUDENTS laugh]

401
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,416
[NANO]
With this thing,

402
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,333
I'll never be able
to go to school.

403
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,833
It would have been better if you
never made me a humanoid robot.

404
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,916
[HAKASE]
Nano...

405
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,041
Huh?

406
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,291
[HAKASE whimpers]

407
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,916
[NANO]
Uhh!

408
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,125
Uh. I'm just kidding.
'Kay? It's a joke.

409
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,791
Stop crying. Please! I'm sorry!

410
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,208
Fine, take it!

411
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,041
Huh?

412
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,875
Take the Akutagawa Prize!

413
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,208
Wait, what?!

414
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,291
[HAKASE]
You heard me!

415
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,291
Akutagawa prize!
You should go get it!

416
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,875
[NANO]
This is my ordinary life.

417
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,416
[MALE STUDENT K]
So, uh. Where am I?

418
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,666
[NANO'S TOE] Hello there!
This is Nano's big toe speaking!

419
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,083
Fun fact: My storage
capacity is one gigabyte.

420
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,416
That's not a whole
lot nowadays, is it?

421
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,375
Next time on <i>My Ordinary Life</i> :
It's the second episode!

422
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,708
Look forward to it!

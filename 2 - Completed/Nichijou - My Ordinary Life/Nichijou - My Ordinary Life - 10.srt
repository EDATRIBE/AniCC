00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,791
[MAI]
Green light...

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,208
And red light.

3
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:51,625
[BOTH gasp]

4
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,625
[YUUKO]
This is bad! Really, really bad!

5
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,916
Homeroom's starting and
I'm so freakin' late!

6
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,083
Gotta come up with
a really good excuse!

7
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,958
I can't say I stopped
to help an old lady,

8
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,625
or that my mom didn't
wake me up on time--

9
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,833
I used those already!

10
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,041
What's believable?

11
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,291
And what'll for sure
get me out of trouble?

12
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,791
[YUUKO] What was even the
point of the red light?!

13
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,458
[YUUKO] How did I hit
every single stop light

14
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,875
on the way over?

15
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,708
Thanks to that, I have
to awkwardly show up

16
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,416
in the middle of first period!

17
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,375
[gasps]

18
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,583
[yelps]

19
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,875
[YUUKO]
What's with the booby trap?

20
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,875
As if I'd fall for
such a basic prank.

21
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,625
Ah! A two-fer?

22
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,041
What kind of cruel and
unusual punishment is this?

23
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,583
I didn't even do anything
wrong! Besides being late.

24
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,083
It's a good thing
I can just slip in

25
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,583
through the little
side door here.

26
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,958
At least that saves
me the embarrassment

27
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,625
of getting chewed out at
the front of the classroom.

28
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,916
[gasps]

29
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,125
[grunts]

30
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,791
[YUUKO]
Yup. Of course it's locked.

31
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,291
It just had to be locked
today of all days!

32
00:03:56,375 --> 00:04:00,166
I know! I can just sneak through
the bottom door thingy!

33
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,833
I'll just slip in like the
wind, completely undetected,

34
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,208
and they'll be none the wiser.

35
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,166
[YUUKO]
What is going on?

36
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,541
I should've known!

37
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,583
There's only one mastermind
in this entire school

38
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,750
who'd do this and
she's in my class.

39
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,541
I guess it could
be for the best.

40
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,708
If I crawled through there,

41
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,375
I'd probably get into
even more trouble.

42
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,666
But if I'm gonna go down,

43
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,625
I might as well take
the high road!

44
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:47,208
[YUUKO] Since when do we have
stained-glass windows?

45
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,000
Hang on, why am I running?

46
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,583
There's nothing
to run away from.

47
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,458
I've got no choice but to go
back and face the music.

48
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,750
It's the right thing to do.

49
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,541
Looks like there's only
one way this can go

50
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,250
that works out for me.

51
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,875
If I am to perish, I shall
accept my fate proudly.

52
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,208
I'll march in through the front
door and go out with a bang.

53
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,875
That would be awesome!

54
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,750
Now, it's show time!

55
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,583
Prepare yourself, eraser.

56
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,000
You're gonna smack
this class clown

57
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,041
with a giant grin on her face!

58
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,333
Sorry I'm late,
but I <i>erased</i> to get here!

59
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,541
[STUDENTS laughing]

60
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,208
[YUUKO] Everyone will
think I'm hilarious!

61
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,375
Do you have any idea
what time it is, young lady?

62
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,666
[sighs]

63
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,541
But I just can't
stay mad at you.

64
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,083
Go ahead and take
your seat, ya rascal!

65
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,000
[YUUKO]
I got this! I totally got this!

66
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,958
I am beauty. I am grace.

67
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,708
I shall appear...

68
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,916
...with a smile on my face!

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,541
Good morning, my
fellow classmates!

70
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,625
I'm here and ready to
start the tardy party!

71
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,250
[yells]

72
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,375
[YUUKO]
I'm an invincible alien!

73
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,708
[YUUKO yelling]

74
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,708
What stupid crap are
you up to this time?

75
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,291
Aren't you a little old to be
messing around like this?

76
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,458
[YUUKO] People from planet
Invincible are safe

77
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,666
from every sort of attack!

78
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,583
[BASEBALL PLAYER A]
Hey! Uh. Heads up! I guess!

79
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,375
[whines]

80
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,791
[SAKAMOTO]
Would you shut up?!

81
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,625
Miles Davis is rolling
in his grave!

82
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm so sorry!

83
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,708
I guess we got a little bit
carried away there, huh?

84
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,500
So what'd you think
of our sound, cool cat?

85
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,500
[SAKAMOTO]
It was pure torture!

86
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,833
And the only "sound"
I could hear

87
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,541
was the rupturing
of my ear drums!

88
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,916
Maybe you'll change your
mind if I play it again.

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,458
[SAKAMOTO]
Did you hear a word I said?!

90
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:29,333
[HAKASE blowing]

91
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,541
[SAKAMOTO]
Heh?

92
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,791

[NANO blowing]

94
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,916
[ANNAKA] Looks like there's
gonna be flowing noodles

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
at the park by the shrine today.

96
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,958
Guess I'll check it out!

97
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,250
I've only ever seen
it done on TV,

98
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:05,250
but I bet it'll be super neat
to do it myself in real life!

99
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,083
Gotta try and get a
good spot at the front,

100
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,375
or I might miss out on
the noodly goodness!

101
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,125
I haven't eaten at all today,

102
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:16,208
so I gotta make sure to snag a
buncha noods and eat my fill!

103
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,750
[giggling]

104
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,958
[ANNAKA]
Uh...

105
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,791
Noodles!

106
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:33,125
[yelling]

107

[whines]

108
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,583
What the hell are you doing?!

109
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,375
Are you trying to
screw things up?!

110
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,166
[wheezes]

111
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,291
Here comes some more.

112
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,208
[ANNAKA] Um, excuse me,
but I don't, uh...

113
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,500
What?!

114
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,583
Are you gonna show up here,
waste my noodles,

115
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,083
and just give up?

116
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,666
I don't know who
you think you are,

117
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,458
but that ain't
gonna fly with me!

118
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,083
[ANNAKA]
Uhh...

119
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,458
So, don't be mad,

120
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,208
but, uh, I don't have
any chopsticks with me.

121
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,958
You're quite the
demanding brat, huh?!

122
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,791
Here, you better be ready now!

123
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,375
[ANNAKA]
Okay.

124
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,916
[ANNAKA]
Eww...

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,458
Sorry to bother you,

126
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,416
but I think these are
kinda-sorta used already.

127
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,333
Deal with it.

128
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,041
[ANNAKA gasps]

129
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,500
Enough chatter! My noodles
wait for no one, get it?

130
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,750
[ANNAKA] Oh, well,
guess I have no choice.

131
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,500
Aww.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,583
When I dish out a joke,
you're supposed to laugh.

133
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,375
[chuckles nervously]

134
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,000
The next one coming up
will be different,

135
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,666
and I'll show you
what true hell is like!

136
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,791
So get ready!

00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,125

00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,875
[ANNAKA]
Uhh...

139
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,833
I'm not gonna waste
all my water on you!

140
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,416
It's dry noodle or no noodle!

141
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,833
Don't you even think
about skipping them.

142
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,583
I, uh...

143
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,583
Would you quit being so flaky?

144
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,000
Dig in and savor the
flavor of raw noodles!

Uhh...

[LADY A]
What are you waiting for?!

147
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,333
They won't stay fresh
all day, y'know!

You haven't changed one bit.

00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,833
[ANNAKA]
Uh?

151
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,125
[LADY A]
Y-You came back.

152
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,791
[ANNAKA]
Uh...?

153
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,750
[LADY A]
Masaharu!

154
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,291
When I caught word of the
flowing noodles in the park,

155
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,375
I knew it had to be you.

156
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,458
[LADY A] I only did it all
this time because I knew

157
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,458
that you would come
back to me someday.

158
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,750
It's been 30 years
since you left to search

159
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,041
for the most delicious
flowing noodles.

160
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,625
Were you able to find them?

161
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,500
[ANNAKA]
Huh?

162
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,083
I sampled noodles from
all across the land,

163
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,416
but I'm afraid that it
was all for naught.

164
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,000
[grunts]

165
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,208
I used our savings
to support my travels,

166
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,541
but I must report, they're as
dry as an uncooked nood.

167
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,833
[ANNAKA]
Eh?

168
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,375
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,416
Could you ever accept a broken
man without his noodles?

170
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,625
[ANNAKA]
Huh?!

171
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,250
Of course.

172
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,541
[LADY A] What are you
lookin' at?! Keep on walking!

173
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,791
[ANNAKA yelps]

174
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,291
[EGI]
Excuse me, miss,

175
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,541
but could you make like a
flowing noodle and slip away?

Listen up, freshman,
it's announcement time!

178
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,333
There are some people
who learn with praise

179
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,416
and others who learn
through criticism.

180
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,250
And I will be the one to
determine which type you are,

181

[WORD-TIME NARRATOR]
When you learn through praise,

183
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,250
but never get praised.

I put my hair in a ponytail!

What do you think?

194
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,500
It makes you look
a lot more mature

195
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,250
when you put your
hair up like that.

tell me more about

never thought of myself

209
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,375
Yeah, you're right.

210
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,250
I guess you aren't
all that mature, huh?

00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,750

be the one who cleans up!

is turn on the dial.

00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,750
What do I want to become?
What do I want to do?

349
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,250
What to do...

350
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,500
[grunting]

351
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,083
[YUUKO]
No good. I've got nothing.

352
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,333
I just started high school,

353
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,958
so I guess I have a few
years to think it over.

354
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:35,500
If I've still got nothing
by then, that means...

355
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:40,416
College! Exams! And studying!

356
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,125
And I don't wanna study!

357
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,916
No, I can't think like that!

358
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,458
I just need a plan.

359
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,916
I have to figure out what
I wanna do with my life.

360
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,333
Once I figure that out,
everything will fall into place!

361
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,166
[YUUKO]
What do I wanna do?

362
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,458
What do I wanna do?

363
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:05,500
[groaning]

364
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,625
[YUUKO]
Oh, hey, Mom!

365
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,833
[YUUKO'S MOM yells]

366
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,333
Would you stop
banging on the floor?!

367
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,583
Don't you know how late it is?

368
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,708
[YUUKO] Well, I'm not too
great with tough questions.

369
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:55,083
For now, I'll just
do my homework.

370
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,041
[YUUKO grunting]

371
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:35,416
[YUUKO] Dammit! I still
don't wanna do my homework!

372
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,291
[LIZARD]
Heya! I'm a frilled lizard!

373
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,125
I'm pretty tough to
fold as origami!

374
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,416
It might take a few sheets

375
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,708
before you finally figure
out how to make me!

376
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:47,250
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 11!

377
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,208
You better look forward to it!

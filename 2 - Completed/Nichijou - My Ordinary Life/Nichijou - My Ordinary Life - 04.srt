347
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,833
[YUUKO] Did she want to
confess her feelings?

348
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,500
But why, and since when?

349
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,875
How long has she felt this way?

350
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,083
Hey, uh, Mai, I just have a
little something to clear up.

351
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,791
Uh. The thing is,
I don't know what to say!

352
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,208
This is all happening so fast,

353
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,250
and we're both so young,
and we're only in high school!

354
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,208
We've got our whole
lives ahead of us!

355
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,958
I think we might be
rushing into things!

356
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,083
You know that I was
just kidding, right?

357
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,791
[YUUKO] That was super, ultra,
great, delicious, wonderfully

358
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,458
hard to understand!

359
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:40,916
Why would you do that?!

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,833
You totally had me going there!

361
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,750
Now you're saying
it was all a joke?!

362
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,000
I see.

363
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,458
Uh...?

364
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,541
You're usually so perceptive
to these kinds of things,

365
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,208
so I was expecting that
you would figure out

366
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,833
what I was up to
and play along.

367
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,250
Well, I...

368
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,833
I had a feeling you were
up to something.

369
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,791
You're a liar.

370
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,541
Not exactly. I knew that
something was off,

371
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,041
it just took time for my
brain to process the signs.

372
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,541
I almost had you
figured out, too.

373
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,500
You ended up dropping the
act before I could put it

374
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,833
all together and start
playing off of you.

375
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,916
Didn't you just say that I
totally had you going earlier?

376
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,208
Huh?

377
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,083
I hate being lied to
more than anything,

378
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,666
so you can stop making excuses.

379
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,125
[YUUKO]
Uh...

380
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,958
Sorry.

381
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,041
Chill out I'm still just
joking with you.

382
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,208
[YUUKO] I don't even know
what to believe anymore!

383
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,666
So you didn't notice then?

384
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,833
You couldn't catch
the other joke I made?

385
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:38,666
[YUUKO] I don't care,
just tell me what it was!

386
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,500
It was at the very
beginning when I said

387
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,708
I thought you were smart.

388
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,125
You went along with it, so I
just kept on messing with you.

389
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:50,083
[YUUKO]
That was why?!

390
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:54,625
Well, at least I can understand
why you made that first joke.

391
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,416
[APARTMENT]
It's me!

392
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,541
Your friendly neighborhood
apartment complex!

393
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,791
Can you believe I'm
over 40 years old now?

394
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,000
I guess you could
call me the land lady.

395
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,416
That's got a raunchy
ring to it, doesn't it?

396
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,333
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 5.

397
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,750
Look forward to it!

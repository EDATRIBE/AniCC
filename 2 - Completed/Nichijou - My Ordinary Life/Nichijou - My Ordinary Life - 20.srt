00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,666
[MIO]
That's it. No more excuses!

353
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,708
I can't believe you!

354
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,833
Well, yeah, uh,
I was saying--

355
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,833
I don't care what
you have to say!

356
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,458
[MIO sobbing]

357
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,541
[sighs]

358
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,583
You coming over to help out

359
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,041
was a nice gesture
and everything.

360
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,333
I get that.

361
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,625
But all you did was
make things worse for me.

362
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,750
[MIO] And then, after I said
that we were out of paper,

363
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,166
instead of going out
and getting more,

364
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,541
you had to make it difficult.

365
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,583
Do you remember that?

366
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,625
I asked you to go buy some,
and what did you say?

367
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,416
[YUUKO]
Hey, how's about we flip for it?

368
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,333
[YUUKO grunts] Take it off our
hands... and leave it to fate!

369
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,875
Not a chance in hell!

370
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,500
You're the one who spilled all
the ink and ruined the page.

371
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,291
How could you even
consider making me go

372
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,666
when I have so much
work to do? Come on!

373
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,875
But I got over it!

374
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,208
You ended up agreeing with me

375
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,958
and you said you'd be the
one to go to the store.

376
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,625
And then what did
you have to say?

377
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,291
Mio, I, uh...

378
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,916
What did you say?

379
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,208
Question.

380
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,375
Judging by my face,
how old do I look?

381
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,000
Who cares?!

382
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,250
You just keep wasting my time

383
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,875
and the paper store's
gonna close!

384
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,708
Why bring that up
now of all times?

385
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,208
Why would you ask me that?

386
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,458
But I got over it!

387
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,666
You finally decided to
head off to the store,

388
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,083
and what did you suddenly
have to complain about?

389
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,208
[YUUKO]
It sure is chilly out.

390
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh, speaking of, I think
I might've caught a cold.

391
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,250
How could you have caught
a cold out of nowhere?!

392
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,125
You just kept on
wasting my time!

393
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,166
And--it's not even
that cold out!

394
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,416
But I got over it!

395
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,208
And? What did you
come back with in hand?

396
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,000
The hell is that anyway?!

397
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,958
All you had to do was
get the manuscript paper

398
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,083
like I asked!

399
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,791
But you had to make
your stupid jokes!

400
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,916
And you just could never
tell when enough was enough!

401
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,750
[YUUKO]
Here.

402
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,291
That's a hard pass for me!

403
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,166
I thought I was at the
end of my rope with you,

404
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,333
but you keep finding
more rope to cut!

405
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,458
Especially when you don't stop

406
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,583
coming up with
dumb things to say!

407
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,875
I'm so sorry, calamari.

408
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,708
Calamari?!

409
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,083
This isn't even funny anymore!

410
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,750
Where the hell did
calamari come from anyway?

411
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,333
And after all that,

412
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,583
I still actually believed that
you got the manuscript paper.

413
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,375
But it was some esoteric joke
that gave me a headache!

414
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,791
All I wanted was for you to
hurry up and get the paper,

415
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,333
but what did you say to that?

416
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,041
Sorry for the delay.
Please frog-ive me.

417
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,750
It's a frog now?!

418
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,791
Are you actually asking
for forgiveness?

419
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,041
Or are you asking me
to give you a frog?

420
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,541
I ask you one final time

421
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,083
if you actually got any
of the manuscript paper,

422
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,958
and what did you
have to say to that?

423
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,416
Sorry safari.

424
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,375
Where'd safari come from and
what happened to calamari?!

425
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,708
Wait, who cares about calamari?

426
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,583
Where is my paper?

427
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,625
Oh, yeah! You gave
me something else!

428
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,958
--[YUUKO] Here.
--[MIO] Writing paper. Indeed.

429
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,041
[MIO] Now I have all the
tools I need... for my novel.

430
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,500
Wrong kind of paper!

431
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,666
How long do you intend to
make a joke out of my life

432
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,666
until you're satisfied?

433
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,291
What do you want from me, huh?

434
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,666
Oh wait, you said--!

435
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,708
You know, there's a funny
thing about the truth.

436
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,083
It's not always true.

437
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,208
[MIO]
Yes, it is!

438
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,625
I decided you were a lost cause

439
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,958
and I had no choice
but to turn to Nano.

440
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,375
But I messed up and showed
her my work in progress.

441
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,375
And then she--!

442
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,750
[NANO squeals]

443
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,000
She got hooked!

444
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,333
Thanks, but no thanks!

445
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,541
She just can't stop squealing!

446
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,000
I got so desperate,
I even asked Mai for help!

447
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,916
Mai, could you do me a favor
and get me some more paper?

448
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,375
[MIO grunts]
But she bounced already!

449
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,875
She vanished like the wind!

450
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:04,125
Flowing swiftly yet
silently at her own pace!

451
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,500
Sure, it was kind
of disrespectful,

452
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,000
but that's not the point!

453
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,416
The point is, you saw the
goodbye letter she left behind,

454
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,833
and you said what?

455
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,458
[YUUKO]
This could be a sign from God,

456
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,916
or the trap of a demon.

457
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,416
You're the demon
who's trapping me!

458
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,041
This entire day has been a trap

459
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,458
since you showed up to
quote-unquote "help"!

460
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,708
And it just kept on
going and going!

461
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,458
I don't even get that one!

462
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,708
--[YUUKO] Uh, you know--
--Shut up!

463
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,833
I don't wanna hear any
more excuses from you!

464
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,708
You're just a pumpkin head!

465
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,958
Hang on, now.

466
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,250
Don't go nuts.

467
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,375
I'm only going nuts
because you're making me!

468
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:40,125
You dumb... [pants]

469
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,125
...giant peanut head!

470
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,333
[YUUKO]
I'm trying to tell you--

471
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,916
Don't try to give me
another one of your--

472
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,833
Your--

473
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Huh? [gasps]

474
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,791
[gasps]

475
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,083
[YUUKO groans]

476
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,708
[MIO]
Uh...

477
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,375
[MIO]
I'm sorry.

478
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,125
Please... frog-ive me?

479
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,041

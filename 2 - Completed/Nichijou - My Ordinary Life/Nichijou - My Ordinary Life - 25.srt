that interfering with
official police business

210

Got scouted by a boxing coach.

that daydreaming
is totally free.

[NAKAMURA] Damn. I completely
lost track of her.

256
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,708
[NAKAMURA]
I was hot on her trail

257
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,625
when she was running
around the school,

258
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,791
but I took my eyes
off her for a moment,

259
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,791
and she suddenly slipped away!

260
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,333
Huh?

261
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,750

and surprising feature!

[NAKAMURA] Now then,
I've traveled this far.

265
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,041
Perhaps I should try
locating her home.

Hmm, on second thought, it might
be best to tread carefully.

I'll continue my pursuit
for knowledge tomorrow

268
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,625
and retreat for the time being.

[NAKAMURA]
It's hiding in plain sight!

I've discovered this house
completely by chance. Finally!

since I started this mission!

I'm too caught up in
the thrill of the moment!

To think, the genius
who built her

277
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,583
could be in that very building!

278
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,833

to study her every detail!

wrestler cowboy Bill Watts

If this is indeed the
house of her creator,

285
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,916
then there's no telling what
sort of traps there may be.

286
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,666
If I am to infiltrate
this place,

287
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,166
I must be extremely cautious

288
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,458
and pay close attention
to my surroundings.

[NAKAMURA]
Oh, no!

00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,250
I've been spotted by the
home's surveillance robot!

293
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,208
The build quality looks
lower than Nano's,

294
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,750
but he's likely made with the
same advanced technology.

295
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,041
If it determines
that I'm a threat,

296
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,750
he'll undoubtedly dispose of me!

297
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,708
I have no choice!

298
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,833
I must show that I mean no harm!

on the ground?

300
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,083
[NAKAMURA]
Compromised again!

301
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,625
So, I heard that goat of yours

302
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,833
carried an injured old lady
to the hospital last week.

303
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,208
Yes, he did.

304
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,041
Then the reason you bring
a goat is because it's

305
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,333
a service animal for
emergency situations like that?

306
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,791
[KOUJIROU chuckles]
Silly.

Here you are.

310
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,916
[NAKAMURA] I can't believe
they got the jump on me.

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,083
I was trying to infiltrate
the Shinonome home,

312
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,125
but a warm, hospitable welcome
was not what I had in mind.

313
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,125
However, I can see
through this ruse.

314
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,416
I'm on to their tricks.

315
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,791
For example, this tea.

316
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,416
I'm certain it contains
some sort of drug

317
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,458
that will erase my memory
the moment I drink it.

318
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,750
And this room may seem ordinary,
but I'm sure I'm being watched.

319
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,958
[gasps] What is that?

320
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,291
It has a terrifyingly
concerning aura.

321
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,791
Such random placement.

322
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,250
And those painted-on
sunglasses can't fool me!

323
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,166
I can't see its eyes, but I can
certainly feel their gaze!

324
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,166
I can't make a single wrong
move. It's all-seeing!

325
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,625
What's wrong, Ms. Nakamura?

326
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,500
[NAKAMURA gasps]
Absolutely nothing!

327
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,000
My apologies!

328
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,208
[NAKAMURA]
I drank it all.

329
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,375
I'm a fool.

330
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,500
But if this does wipe my memory,

331
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,250
then I might as well
make a stand!

332
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,875
[NAKAMURA] I'll be
completely honest with you.

333

any romantic involvement
between the two of us

would be the most
appropriate thing right now!

[gasps] You idiot!
You misunderstand my words!

352
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,833
[NAKAMURA]
A child?

353
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,333
It couldn't be her child.

354
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,208
Of course not.

355
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,750
She's a robot after all!

356
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:54,625
But that garb.

357
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,125
It's that of an intellectual.

358
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,666
Could she be Nano's creator?

359
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,666
So, this child is not
the child at all,

360
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,041
but maybe Nano is
the child? Yes?

361
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,541
There's no way someone so
young could create Nano.

362
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,375
Hello, you can call me Hakase.

363
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,833
Oh, and I created Nano.

364
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,375
[NAKAMURA]
Shoulder block!

365
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,208
[NANO gasps]
Hakase!

366
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,166
[NAKAMURA]
So it's true.

367
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,041
This child is Nano's creator.

368
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,333
--[SAKAMOTO] Hey!
--[NAKAMURA gasps]

369
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,208
[SAKAMOTO] Could you
get me out of this thing?

370
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,250
I'm tired of all of your pranks!

371
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,791
[NAKAMURA gasping]

372
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,625
[NAKAMURA]
A homunculus!

373
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,958
The surveillance robot,
and the daruma weapon,

374
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,833
and the child creator, and Nano
Shinonome, and the homunculus!

375
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,416
I admit that I was
a fool to think that

376
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,541
I was even remotely prepared to
try and infiltrate this home.

377
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,333
But I never could have
seen any of this coming!

378
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,833
I must find a chance
to strategically retreat

379
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,750
and reformulate my plans.

380
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,583
But...

381
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,333
Knowing that thing is watching
has me paralyzed in fear.

382
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,750
I couldn't make an attempt
to leave even if I tried!

383
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,166
If I suddenly state out of
nowhere that I have to go home--

384
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,833
[NAKAMURA gasps]

385
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,666
[NAKAMURA]
I have no other options.

386
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,500
[HAKASE, NANO gasp]

387
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,000
Where's the bathroom?

388
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,125
I must pee.

389
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,333
Uh, okay.

390
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,333
I'll show you where to go--

391
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,583
[NAKAMURA]
No need!

392
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,500
If you can give
me the directions,

393
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,375
I can find it on my own.

394
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,333
[NAKAMURA chuckles] I've
completely outwitted you again,

395
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,791
Nano Shinonome.

396
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,500
My plan worked perfectly.

397
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,875
Because of course it did.

398
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,208
I knew how you'd respond.

399
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,666
You see, I capitalized
on your weakness.

400
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,083
That's right.

401
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,375
Your kindness leaves you
gullible and far too trusting!

402
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,833
And when I return
to this deathtrap

403
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,041
you call your humble abode,

404
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,083
I shall turn the
tables on you yet.

405
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,291
Just you wait.

406
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,125
As long as I have this
big brain of mine,

407
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,000
you'll be completely
at my mercy!

408
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,500
Eventually!

409
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,041
Oh. Are you leaving?

410
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,250
[NAKAMURA gasps]
Crap!

411
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,791
Uh, well, you see,

412
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,958
I was just asked to mow the
grass on the lawn outside and--

413
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,875
[NAKAMURA gasps]

414
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,208
What the--?

415
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,458
[BISCUIT #2]
Hang on! Don't move!

416
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,375
I'll get help!

417
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,083
No! Wait! Don't go!

418
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,916
[NAKAMURA]
Oh, no! They're onto me!

419
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,333
They're going to see me out here

420
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,541
and realize that I lied to
them and tried to escape!

421
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,041
Dammit, what is this stuff?

422
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,916
It's robbing me of
my movement, my freedom!

423
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,125
She's over here!

424
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,625
Huh? But the bathroom's
the other direction.

425
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,416
[NANO gasps]
What is this thing?

426
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,666
Right! Hakase!

427
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,791
Your special glue comes off
with water, doesn't it?

428
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,291
[NAKAMURA] If they capture me
here, then I'll be done for!

429
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,750
But my studies! My science!

430
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,958
[NAKAMURA gasps]

431
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,291
[NAKAMURA]
Oh, no!

432
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,708
I must find a way to get
out of this literal mess!

433
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:28,291
Curse you, clever bastards
of the Shinonome Lab!

434
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,125
[NANO]
Water!

435
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,750
[NAKAMURA]
Somebody help.

436
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,208
Anybody!

437
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:36,708
Get me out of here!

438

[MONK 25A groans]

439
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,041
[MIO]
Oh, I actually have that one.

440
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,791
[ANNAKA] Really? Do you
think I could borrow it?

441
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,291
Yeah, sure. I can
bring it tomorrow.

442
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,375
[NANO] "Who knows what'll
happen" and "that's baseball"?

443
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,666
Is that all she said?

444
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,291
[YUUKO] Yeah. And she
was acting all happy

445
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,875
and laughing and stuff.

446
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,666
[NANO] Maybe she was
trying to be strong

447
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,041
and laugh through the pain.

448
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,166
Getting indirectly rejected
by the guy you like

449
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,875
isn't something you
just "get over."

450
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,250
[YUUKO] Well, she doesn't not
look like she's not unhappy.

451
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,416
[NANO]
Wait, run that by me again?

452
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,083
Yuuko, you forgot your
homework again, didn't you?

453
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,666
No! Don't be ridiculous!

454
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,166
But wait, I actually
did forget, so yeah.

455
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,958
Make up your mind!

456
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,166
You'll find out
after the commercial!

457
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,166
Huh?

458
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,375
Wow! That was so
random and funny!

459
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,416
Don't you think so?

Wait, rap?

[ANNAKA]
Oh, and Mio.

463
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,291
There's something else
I gotta ask you.

464
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,791
Okay.

465
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,666
What's up?

466
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,250
Hey, Yuuko. You know
her the best, right?

467
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,458
Can you think of anything
that might help cheer her up?

468
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,916

I wonder where they all went.

469
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,458
And here I was hoping we could
go out and grab some food

470
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,625

You're so obvious.

00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,083
I see Nano's key poking out.

479

[NANO] It's not like this is
a robotic key or anything!

[YUUKO] Uh, anyways, everyone
who passes through here

at the lottery!

I don't really know
what you guys are doing.

485

Well whatever.

we have a winner!

00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,250
How? I don't get it.

488

[YUUKO]
And here's your special prize!

00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,583
What makes it special?

getting harder and
harder to understand,

There was something that
Koujirou said a while back.

504
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,416
What was it?

505
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,916
[MIO] Something about our
ordinary lives passing us by.

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,833
And how it may actually be a
series of wonderful miracles.

507
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:59,958
I think... no, I know...
all of that is true.

All right!

00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,208
I'm gonna go home
and draw some manga!

that all weird?

consume media content

That's my ordinary life!

526
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:53,041
And the next <i>My Ordinary Life</i>
is the last one!

527
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,875
Look forward to it!

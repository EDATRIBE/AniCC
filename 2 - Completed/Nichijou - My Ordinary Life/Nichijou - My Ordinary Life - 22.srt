00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,583
[NAKANOJOU]
Everything in this world

2
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,041
can be explained by science.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,458
[NAKANOJOU]
Our society is infatuated

4
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,000
by things like ghosts
and paranormal phenomena,

5
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,958
but such stupid stuff
couldn't possibly be real!

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,041
They can't exist.

7
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,166
[NAKANOJOU]
Which is why...

8
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,416
[NAKANOJOU grunts]

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,958
[NAKANOJOU] ...I refuse
to believe in spirits!

10
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,666
[NAKANOJOU]
I stopped by my local temple

11
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,000
to ask for a
so-called "exorcism."

12
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,166
[MONK 19A] Hmm. Now, what can I
help you with today, young man?

13
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,541
[NAKANOJOU] If I act like I'm
possessed by an evil spirit,

14
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,083
I can call him out on his
nonsense when he tries to help.

15
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,666
My throat's been
kinda sore lately,

16
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,708
and it almost feels like
someone, or something,

17
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,041
is strangling me.

18
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,166
Oh?

19
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,583
Try this.

20
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,041
It should clear that right up.

21
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,291
[NAKANOJOU]
I knew it!

22
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,625
He's probably gonna give
me some sort of trinket

23
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,625
to ward away evil or something!

24
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,291
[MONK 19A]
Those cough drops help with

25
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,875
all kinds of throat pain.

26
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,541
[NAKANOJOU] Well, I guess that's
a perfectly logical solution.

27
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,333
Maybe my symptoms weren't
supernatural enough for him.

28
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,041
It looks like I'm gonna
have to go further

29
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,583
to make him believe me!

30
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,250
[gasps] Huh?

31
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,458
You don't get it!

32
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,750
This isn't just some
ordinary sore throat!

33
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,500
It's like...

34
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,458
...I can feel someone's hands
around my neck, choking me!

35
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,958
And when it gets really bad,

36
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,500
I start making these creepy
noises against my will.

37
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,500
It's almost like I'm possessed!

38
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,500
Well. That's something.

39
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,833
Maybe lay off the horror movies.

40
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,583
And, uh... go away.

this paranormal
professional would just

44
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,000
shoot me down like that.

45
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,875
Then again, I guess
I didn't double check

46
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,166
if he actually did
believe in spirits.

47
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,166
But whatever. I can't let
this trip be for nothing!

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,041
I'm not gonna leave without
giving it my best shot!

something sinister

He wasn't fooled at all!

Of course he wasn't.

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,041
I'll have to commit
to my performance

if I'm gonna have any chance
at convincing an expert!

60

I've really gotta sell this.

I have to take it to the limit!

I went a little overboard.

I believe that everything
on this planet

90
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,291
can be explained by science.

91
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,875

you weren't even in middle
school yet, were you?

105

coming to the dojo forever ago.

worse the more I practice,

gonna have to pass.

I just can't stand
that she got so good

124
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,416
without training as
hard as the rest of us.

125
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,791
I heard that during her
first year of middle school,

126
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,583
she was able to score a point
against one of the instructors!

even on the weekends!

132
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,750
My instructor told me that
my hard work'll pay off,

133
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,708

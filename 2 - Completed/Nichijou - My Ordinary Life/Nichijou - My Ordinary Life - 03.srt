we go. Problem solved!

was on your desk.

it and had a secret funeral?

Or because I changed
my mind, dug it back up,

75

and left a memorial
on your desk?

76

Or because I changed
my mind again

cremate it instead?

347
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,208
But now I'm all warmed up
and ready to go for real.

348
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,208
All right, bring it on!

349
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,083
[YUUKO] Man, I didn't think my
arm would still be this sore!

350
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,791
It's from my all-nighter!

351
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,875
But I'm just gonna shake it off
and get my head in the game.

352
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:22,958
'Bout time I got serious.
Think you can handle me?

353
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,416
[YUUKO] Ah, dang it!
I completely spaced on that one!

354
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,291
I can't believe I threw
three rounds in a row!

355
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,208
I never woulda seen that coming!

356
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,250
That's quite the surprise!

357
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,166
Okay. That's enough.

358
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,541
Hold on. Just you wait and see.

359
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,666
Mm-hm, I get it. I understand
what happened now.

360
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,083
Of course! It's simple!

361
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,583
You're all out of
beginner's luck,

362
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,916
and now it's the end for you!
Prepare to meet your doom!

363
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,333
Ready!

364
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:57,166
[YUUKO] Well, isn't this an
interesting turn of events?

365
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,458
What do they call you again?

366
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,791
--[MIO] Hey now.
--The immoveable object, right?

367
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,333
Mio, hold this for me!

368
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,583
'Cause I'm about to unleash
the unstoppable force.

369
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,541
Prepare for something
really special!

370
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,583
Would you please cut that out?!

371
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,625
It's because you're
not even trying!

372
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,041
I can't fight for real if you
don't take this seriously!

373
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,041
Come at me with everything
you've got this time!

374
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,041
I'll unleash my ultimate moves!

375
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,125
Earth Destroyer!

376
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,291
Shooting Star!

377
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,750
Death! [groans]

378
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:30,625
Death!

379
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,208
[banging]

380
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,458
[YUUKO]
Why? I don't get it.

381
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,041
Why does it have to be this way?

382
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,333
It's only arm wrestling.

383
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:05,333
How can you be so
freakin' good at it?

384
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:09,041
I completely forgot I had
to pee this entire time.

385
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,083
I'll be right back.

386
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,583
I knew something was throwing me
off from the very beginning.

387
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,125
[MAI]
Yuuko?

388
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,000
One extra snack
from the station.

389
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,500
And 23 juices.

390
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,541
My stupid arm cramp got
me caught and yelled at

391
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:01,416
for not doing my homework.
Today really is the worst.

392
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,291
More importantly, tell me!

393
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,000
I need to know what
happens to Masao!

394
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,458
Come on, Mai!

395
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,291
Okay fine, I'll buy
you another juice

396
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,375
if you show me what
happens next.

397
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,583
--[MAI] Here.
--[YUUKO] Yoink.

398
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,791
[MASAO gasping]

399
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:15,875
[tiger roars]

400
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,333
[MASAO cheers]

401
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,791
[YUUKO]
I don't know what I expected.

402
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,750
[STRAW DOLL] What was that <i>natto</i>
doing inside of me anyway?

403
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,041
Was that supposed to
be some kind of joke?

404
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,458
Well, if it was,
it was "natto" very funny!

405
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,083
Really, that's
the last "straw."

406
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,041
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 4.

407
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,333
Look forward to it!

00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,375
[YUUKO]
Oh, Mio!

181
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,458
What's up?
Your face looks weird.

182
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,291
Can I see your homework?

183
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,625
[sighs]

184
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,250
Don't tell me that you
forgot to do yours again.

185
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,958
Well... I'm not
exactly proud of it.

186
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,250
[MIO] Girl, you know
you're never gonna learn

187
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,500
if you keep doing this.

188
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,041
Oh, yeah, I get that.

189
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,041
Come on. Just this one time?

190
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,000
I promise I'll never
do it again. Please?

191
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,208
[MIO]
Yuuko.

192
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,000
That's what you say
every time this happens.

193
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,666
I swear on my life!

194
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,416
[MIO] Yeah, and you say
that every time, too.

195
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,291
Oh. Do I? [laughs nervously]

196
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:05,125
Fine. Twist my arm,
why don'tcha.

197
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,208
This is for real the last one.

198
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,625
Like, for real, real.

199
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,166
I hear ya loud n' clear!

200
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,541
You're totally saving
my butt with this, Mio!

201
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,125
[AZUMA]
Hey, Yuuko!

202
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,083
You have to come over
here and see this.

203
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,375
[YUUKO] All right, I'll bring
this back as soon as I'm done.

204
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,791
Coming! Lemme see what you got!

205
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,916
[YUUKOMIO]
Hang on.

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,958
I get the feeling I'm forgetting
something important.

207
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,250
After finishing my
homework last night...

208
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,333
I did a thing...

209
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,583
[SASAHARA]
I won't...

210
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,208
[MIO]
I drew something.

211
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,208
[SASAHARA]
...let you.

212
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,083
[MIO]
And that thing I drew...

213
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:42,958
[MIO]
I forgot to erase it!

214
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,500
[SASAHARA]
I won't let you do this.

215
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,083
It's still in there!

216
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,375
Hey! Got a little problem here!

217
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,250
[gasps]

218
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,625
[AZUMA]
Yeah, I getcha!

219
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,875
I know!

220
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,708
[MIO]
Yuuko!

221
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,625
Hey, I just remembered
that I totally forgot

222
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,791
to do my homework, too!

223
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,458
So, you don't need
my notebook after all!

224
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,000
So, yeah, I'll be taking
this thing back now.

225
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,500
Sorry 'bout it!

226
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,791
Yuuko?

227
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,375
Come on, you don't
need it anymore--

228
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,333
I know you're just trying
to pull a fast one on me,

229
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,833
but I'm not gonna fall for it!

230
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,208
I'll have it back in
no time, I promise!

231
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,416
'Kay?

232
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,416
All right, now where were we?

233
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,541
[MIO]
This is bad.

234
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,500
Really, really bad.

235
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,875
If anyone sees that drawing,

236
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,208
my reputation is gonna
go down the drain!

237
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,541
Why does my fate have to
be in the hands of Yuuko

238
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,208
of all people?! If she starts
spreading rumors...

239
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,166
[gasps]

240
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,041
[YUUKO laughs]

241
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,083
[MIO]
It'll be catastrophic!

242
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,583
[YUUKO humming]

243
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,833
[MIO]
Yuuko!

244
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,500
So, turns out I gave you
the wrong notebook.

245
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,958
This one here's for math.

246
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,375
Huh? But wait, look.

247
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,333
This says "math"
right here on the front.

248
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,541
[screams, whimpers]

249
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,208
Never mind! I need
it back, 'cause uh...

250
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,458
I have a bad stomach ache!

251
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,458
Uh-huh.

252
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,875
[MIO]
Gah!

253
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,791
I'll be done in a jiffy,
so hold your horses, would ya?

254
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,083
[MIO] It's all over.
She's gonna see it, and then...

255
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:26,833
That's it. My short-lived high
school life is done for!

256
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,708
[MIO whimpering]
Listen!

257
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:32,791
I'll buy it off you
for a thousand yen!

258
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,916
Why are you running away?!

259
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,500
Come back!

260
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,916
Fine then!
You want the truth?!

261
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,541
I'll tell you!

262
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,083
It's gonna explode!

263
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,333
[MIO]
There's no way.

264
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,916
She's too fast for me
to catch up to her.

265
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,625
I'll miss you, life.

266
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,000
It was good while it lasted.

267
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,375
Thank you, existence,
for everything.

268
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,625
We had a lot of fun, didn't we?

269
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:15,291
Sure, it got a little weird
sometimes, but overall,

270
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,625
I was pretty happy
with how things were.

271
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:24,208
But this is the end!
My life is truly over now!

272
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,500
And my banquet of boys...

273
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,833
I bid you adieu, as well.

274
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,291
Goodbye.

275
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:34,666
Wait! There's no way
I'll let that happen!

276
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:41,666
The fire in my heart...
must become an inferno!

277
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,708
[MIO]
In the end...

278
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,541
...I failed.

279
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,666
Wait, Yuuko!

280
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,083
Stop running!

281
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,916
You're in the hall!

282
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,125
[YUUKO yelps]

283
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,500
Hey. Are you okay--

284
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,583
Uh!

285
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,791
Here.

286
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,750
[AKAGI] Pass your notebooks
to the person in front of you.

287
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:15,333
And if you forgot your homework,
please speak up now.

288
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,833
[MIO sighs]

289
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,125
[MIO] It was almost really
bad there for a second.

290
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,416
But I guess all's
well that ends well.

291
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,333
Now I can go back to living
my ordinary... life.

292
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,791
Ahh!

293
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:29,625
Huh?

294
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,750
[MIO]
I never erased it!

295
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,750
[SASAHARA]
Yo.

296
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,708
What seems to be the problem?

297
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,625
[MIO]
Teacher! I, uh...

298
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,583
Forgot my homework!

299
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,291
[NANO]
There we go.

300
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,666
Hakase, would you mind
tidying up the room

301
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,958
and putting your
stuff away, please?

302
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,083
Sorry, but I just
don't think I'm ready

303
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,250
to do something like that.

304
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,500
I'm gonna go play now.

305
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,625
[NANO]
Uh...

306
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,541
But then, I ended up telling
him everything anyway!

307
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,250
Wow, are you serious?
Come on, dude!

308
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,583
[IZUMI panting]
Um, excuse me!

309
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,166
Annaka! Could I have a moment?

310
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,541
[ANNAKA]
Yes?

311
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,250
Well, you see. This is just
a minor thing, but...

312
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:33,625
I think your hair ribbon might
be too big. Don't you?

313
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,750
But look! Bunny ears!

314
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,750
[HAKASE chewing]

315
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,125
Sweet buns are tasty.

316
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,583
You said it.

317
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,875
[SHOPKEEPER 2A]
Welcome, miss!

318
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,500
Sasahara. You do realize
that you're a member

319
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,125
of the cultural festival
committee, right?

320
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,750
Can you at least try to be a
bit more serious about this?

321
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,208
Oh, I'm being quite serious.

322
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,958
As the president
of the drama club,

323
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,208
I'm always doing
my part around here.

324
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,250
Or did you perhaps not notice
that, Miss Tachibana?

325
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,500
[MISATO]
Don't patronize me!

326
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,375
It's sweet.

327
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,541
[MISATO]
Would you listen?!

328
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,166
We're supposed to decide
on the programming

329
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,583
for the culture festival.

330
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,541
Your drama club has
nothing to do with it!

331
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,666
Seems like they
changed the brands.

332
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,333
[MISATO growling]

333
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,791
Why on earth did I
have to be paired up

334
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,333
with you of all people?

335
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,083
It tastes quite nice.

336
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,583
[sighs] Here I am, wasting my
time when the kendo tournament

337
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,708
is coming up. Ah, man.

338
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,041
I never should have volunteered

339
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,791
to be a committee member
in the first place.

340
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:18,541
Heh.

341
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,708
[gunshot]

342
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,208
What are you doing?! We need
to come up with an idea!

343
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,166
But you're too busy reading
manga over here.

344
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,958
Sorry, but this volume
was just released.

345
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,208
Don't you have at least
one good thought?

346
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,750
Was my Wine Tasting Tournament
idea not suitable for you?

347
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,250
Of course it wasn't!

348
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,625
I already turned it down!

349
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,291
Think of something!

350
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,958
Hey, Sasahara.

351
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,958
So, what's your excuse
for slacking this time?!

352
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,708
Well. I'm fresh out of
ideas, for starters.

353
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,583
Huh. I'm not getting
a signal here.

354
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,958
[MISATO] What?! And where
do you think you're going?

355
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,666
I'm taking a visit
to the restroom.

356
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,458
[MISATO]
This freakin' guy.

357
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:31,250
[SASAHARA] Huh. It seems like
she was in no mood today.

358
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,083
I thought my Wine Tasting
Tournament was a stellar idea,

359
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,541
but she thought otherwise.

360
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:40,750
However, she has yet to suggest
a single idea of her own.

361
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:46,416
Honestly, I'd fear for my life
if I mentioned that to her.

362
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,875
There's only one way out, I must
be the one to present an idea

363
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,666
that she agrees with.

364
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,250
But that means...

365
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,916
I need to bring myself down
to a commoner's level.

366
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:03,250
[SASAHARA] I suppose I have no
other options at this point.

367
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,250
It's not like you're special to
me or anything like that, okay?

368
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,291
[WORD-TIME NARRATOR]
The purity of Asia.

369
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,875
[SWEET BUN]
I am a sweet bun.

370
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:10,458
Since I'm not very popular
in the Kansai region,

371
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:13,250
people aren't exactly sure
what to call me sometimes.

372
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,666
But now you know!

373
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,750
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 03.

374
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,333
Look forward to it!

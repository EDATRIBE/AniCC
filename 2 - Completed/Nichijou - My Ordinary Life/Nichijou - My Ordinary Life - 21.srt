You sure you're okay?

174
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,750
It kind of looks like
you're in pain, so...

175
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,833
...maybe we should sit down.

176

Don't worry about me!

177
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,291
I'm doing completely
fine, 100 percent fine!

178
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,583
I wouldn't want you to trouble
yourself with something like--

179
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,833
[IZUMI]
...maybe we should sit down.

180
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,708
[gasps] With something like...

181
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,333
[IZUMI]
...maybe we should sit down.

182
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,375
[TAKASAKI gasping]

183
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,625
[IZUMI]
...maybe we should sit down.

00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,583
[TAKASAKI gasps]

185
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,208
[IZUMI]
...maybe we should sit down.

[whimpers]

187
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,291
[TAKASAKI]
This is the best.

188
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,791
I hope it never ends.

189
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,250
[TAKASAKI] I know! I have a
great idea, Ms. Sakurai!

190
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,458
There's a park a
few blocks down,

191
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,166
so why don't we go down
there and sit down?

192
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,708
[IZUMI]
Uh, okay!

193
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,375
[TAKASAKI]
Oh, man.

194
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,583
I can't believe this is
actually happening right now.

195
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,500
[TAKASAKI gasps]
Hang on!

196
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,166
Could this be...
considered a date?!

197
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,416
[gasps]

198
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,166
[TAKASAKI]
Why is she here?

199
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,208
[TAKASAKI] Actually,
you know what? I'm fine!

200
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,000
So maybe we should
just turn around.

201
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,625
[TAKASAKI]
A student, here? Now?

202
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,416
I can't have her
seeing us together.

203
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,625
Uh... Hey! What are you
two doing over there?

204
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,125
[TAKASAKI]
D-Don't be silly!

205
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,833
This is just a completely
casual meeting between adults.

206
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:22,708
And, uh, that's it!

207
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,000
Fancy seeing you here!

208
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,416
If I didn't know any better,

209
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,000
I'd say you two were on a
secret date or something.

210
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,625
If you think it's a secret,
why would you say it out loud?

211
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,000
[YUUKO]
Aw, what's the big deal?

212
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,958
You guys look like
you're having fun!

213
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,958

You turd.

Uh--hm?

216
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,500
I hope you're having a fine
morning today, Ms. Sakurai.

217
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,583
Huh?

218
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,416
Look, it's the two love birds!

219
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,416
Look at 'em blush!

220
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,041
Ooh!

221
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:50,958
That's enough!

222
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,208
No teasing the teachers!

223
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,041
[TAKASAKI sighs] Those darn kids
always take things too far.

224
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,833
I'm sorry about all this.

225
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,416
I hope it didn't cause
you too much trouble.

226
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,375
[IZUMI]
It didn't.

227
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,416
But, um...

228
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,291
I, um, thought it
was kinda cute.

229
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,333
That's it! Okay! Let's do this!

230
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,583
[TAKASAKI]
What's wrong with me?

231
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,541
It would never work out
so perfectly like that!

232
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,666
I gotta get outta here!

233
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,791

Nothing!

Why does it look like you're
hiding something, Mr. Takasaki?

237
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,666
Well, it's been a
lovely coincidence

seeing you here, Ms. Sakurai!

there's a student here, too!

Hm? What was your name?

pick up some green onions.

[NAKAMURA] After one whole
month of investigating,

265
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,000
I've determined
that Nano Shinonome

visits the supermarket in
this district every Saturday.

she'll be arriving soon.

me in this abduction.

come to the supermarket
every week?

00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,208

[grunts] No. I can't
give up now.

00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,083
Ten years minimum.

344
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,583
And the worst part is,
I'd be your warden!

345
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,583
That what you want?

346
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,125
[SOLDIER #22 groans]

347
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,166
No, 22!

348
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,791
Damn it! You're gonna pay!

349
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,791
[SOLDIER #22]
Hold it. I can handle this.

350
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,375
I got careless for
a split second there.

351
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,041
But I've got this under
control now, trust me.

352
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,416
I gotta say.

353
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,916
You sure do pack
quite a powerful punch

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,625
for such a tiny girl.

355
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,625
Now then.

356
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,125
This has been fun,

357
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,708
but it's time you
started talk--[groans]

358
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,333
[SOLDIERS scream]

359
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,333
[SOLDIER #14]
Is he okay?

360
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,541
[SOLDIER #8]
Negative. He's dead.

361
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,125
She's a monster!

362
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,166
The stowaway isn't gonna stop
until she gets the wooden cube!

363
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,583
Let's charge at her together!

364
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,291
We've got her outnumbered.

365
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,625
[OFFICER]
Hmm.

366
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,958
--[SOLDIERS gasp]
--There's no reason to panic,

367
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,375
now that I'm here,
so everybody can settle down.

368
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,875
[SOLDIERS]
Officer!

369
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,875
[OFFICER] Relax. Just sit back
and watch how it's done.

370
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,375
[SOLDIER #8]
In this situation,

371
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,166
the Officer might
actually be our only hope.

372
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,333
[OFFICER]
Hmm. So, she's on a solo mission

373
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,916
to claim the wooden cube.

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Undoubtedly a highly-skilled
agent sent by an unknown enemy.

375
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,875
All that skill and power
could be quite useful, though,

376
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,083
if we can convince her to
switch over to our side.

377
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,375
Fortunately, I am in possession
of the other wooden cube.

378
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,666
It's what she wants,

379
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,666
so it makes the perfect
bargaining chip,

380
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,500
and we should be able
to come to an agreement.

381
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,083
[OFFICER] I just happen to have
the cube you're looking for,

382
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,208
so what do you say
we make a trade?

383
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,166
We could strike a
promising deal--

384
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,875
Ooh!

385
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:35,833
[SOLDIERS]
Officer!

386
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,083
[SOLDIER #8]
He's dead, too!

387
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,625
[SCHOLAR]
This is not good!

388
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,791
[SOLDIER #98] She took down the
Officer like it was nothing!

389
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,958
[SOLDIER #14]
We'll show you!

390
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,500
We're not gonna let you
out of here alive!

391
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,208
[SCHOLAR]
This is bad! Really, really bad!

392
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,750
By definition,
that means it's not good.

393
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,875
What does that mean, Scholar?

394
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,500
How bad is "really, really bad"?

395
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,916
[SCHOLAR gasps] If you would all
stop yelling at me for a moment

396
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,333
and observe the intruder's head,

397
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,625
you'll notice that she has
a wooden cube in her hair.

398
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,291
And if you look on the
other side of her head,

399
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,500
there's another wooden cube.

400
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,833
Meaning that she has a
total of two wooden cubes!

401
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,458
Which means that she has both
wooden cubes in her possession!

402
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,958
--[SOLDIERS gasp]
--But even if she has

403
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,166
both the cubes,

404
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,291
we should be fine as
long as she doesn't know

405
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,750
how to summon the
ancient weapon.

406
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,208
That's right!
We can still win if--

407
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,000
--Shut up and listen to me!
--[SOLDIERS gasp]

408
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,666
[SCHOLAR] It says here
in the Hell Encyclopedia,

409
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,625
that whoever possesses
both of the wooden cubes

410
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,416
will be bestowed with
the unstoppable power

411
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,416
of the ancient weapon!

412
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,833
In other words,

413
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,333
it means that whoever possesses
both of the wooden cubes

414
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,166
will be bestowed with
the unstoppable power

415
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,458
of the ancient weapon.

416
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,333
What does that mean?

417
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,708
Explain that once more, please!

418
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,500
Yeah, I didn't get
it the first time!

not only will we be doomed,

along with us!

Listen. Trying to attack her

434
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,875
head-on one at a time will
only guarantee your demise.

435
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,458
It would be futile.

436
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,041
However! The enemy
is but one lone girl!

437
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,333
So we have the advantage
of numbers on our side!

438
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,208
We must work together
as a complete unit

wooden cubes from her

176
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:12,666
Why does Nano's daruma guy
only have one eyeball filled in?

177
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,541
I know! If I help her out and
fix the other eye for her,

178
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,375
I bet she'll really
appreciate it!

179
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,833
She'll be so grateful, she
might even say that I can eat

180
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,166
all the snacks I want,
whenever I want!

181
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,041
[HAKASE laughs]

182
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,125
[HAKASE]
Oh... I think I messed it up,

183
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,083
'cause that doesn't look
right. Now what do I do?

184
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,875
Nano'll get mad, and...

185
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,750
Uh! What if she gets so mad
she takes my snacks away?!

186
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,291
No more snacks for
Hakase ever again!

187
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,166
[HAKASE whimpers]

188
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,208
[HAKASE] Just put a little this,
and a little there, and uh...

189
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,833
[HAKASE whines]

190
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,375
[SAKAMOTO]
Is something wrong?

191
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,083
Uh! I don't know what
to do Sakamoto! Look.

192
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,583
[SAKAMOTO]
At what? Whoa!

193
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,750
What happened to its face?
You did a number on that thing.

194
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,250
I was just trying to
even out the eyes.

195
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,125
[SAKAMOTO]
Hmm...

196
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,750
[SAKAMOTO] Don't you worry.
I know what we have to do.

197
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,208
[BOTH laughing]

198
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,375
[NANO]
I'm home!

199
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,916
[BOTH]
Gah!

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,916
[SAKAMOTO]
You're on your own.

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,333
[HAKASE]
Sakamoto!

202
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,791
[NANO] Where are you
off to in such a hurry?

203
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,000
Hey, Hakase!

204
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,416
Sorry I took so long,

205
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,041
but I was picking out
new books to bring home.

206
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,708
What'd you do while I was gone?

207
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,583
Wait, what the--?!

208
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,208
What's going on with your belly?

209
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,166
Well, uh. You know how
it goes sometimes.

210
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
[NANO]
What does that even mean?

211
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,125
[gasps] It's coming!

212
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,666
[NANO gasping]
Wait.

213
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,666
There's no way. You can't
possibly be having a child.

214
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,166
I'm having one now!
The baby is coming!

215
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,375
O... kay? Are you pulling
some sort of prank?

216
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,166
I'm not! I'm bringing your
baby brother into the world!

217
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,500
[squeaks]

218
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,333
[NANO gasping]

219
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,000
[NANO laughs]

220
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,083
It's your baby brother.

221
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,083
Goo-goo. Ga-ga.

222
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,000
[SAKAMOTO]
This could be a problem.

223
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,166
[FEMALE VOICE]
Helvetica Standard.

224
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,833
[YUUKO]
Mio! You wanna play a game?

225
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,041
[MIO]
What kind?

226
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,208
How 'bout we play Kokkuri?

227
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,458
[MIO]
What's that?

228
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,791
Wait. You've never
heard of it before?

229
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,166
Nope, never.

230
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,000
[YUUKO] Okay then, I'm gonna
break it down for you.

231
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,708
You start by drawing
a shrine gate

232
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,291
at the top of the paper here.

233
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:57,250
Then you write Yes and No on the
sides, and the alphabet below.

234
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,000
[MIO]
Okay.

235
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,041
And in some regions, I think
you're supposed to draw

236
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,625
a little piece of fried
tofu somewhere

237
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,750
on the paper too, but...

238
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,333
Let's stick to the simplified
version for now.

239
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,208
Then. You have to
make sure to open up

240
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:14,291
a north facing entrance
so the spirits can get inside.

241
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,166
Next, we take a ten-yen coin

242
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,958
and set it on top of the gate
we drew at the beginning.

243
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,166
Finally, we both touch
the coin with our fingers

244
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,791
and ask it a question.

245
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,208
There's no restriction on what
kind of things you can ask

246
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,541
the spirit, so the sky's
basically the limit here.

247
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,708
[MIO]
Sure.

248
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,333
And then, without
any effort of our own,

249
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,541
spirits will slide the coin
around and spell out

250
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,750
the answers to our
questions for us.

251
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,166
Really?

252
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,166
Yeah! I know it's awesome,
but some things are taboo.

253
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,541
First off, you can't play
the game by yourself

254
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,125
and you can't half-ass it.

255
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,916
Because if you do,
you might get possessed!

256
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,500
[MIO]
Oh?

257
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,333
You also risk getting possessed
if you stop partway through,

258
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,875
so you gotta commit.

259
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,250
Right, I get it.

260
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,416
Now you know how to play
the wonderfully spooky game

261
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,458
of Kokkuri! So, whaddaya
say we give it a shot?

262
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,041
[MIO]
Nah, I'm good.

263
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,958
[YUUKO]
Ahhhh....

264
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,708
[NAKANOJOU grunts]

265
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,750
[NAKANOJOU panting]

266
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,083
[IZUMI] So, uh, that
concludes the lessons

267
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,000
I have for you today.

268
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,166
Remember that we'll be
having a quiz tomorrow,

269
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,291
so make sure you don't
forget to study tonight!

270
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,458
[CHIYODA] What? Can't you
push the quiz back?

271
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,500
It doesn't matter
if you take it later,

272
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,916
you're still gonna bomb it.

273
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,708
[STUDENTS laugh]

274
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,791
[CHIYODA]
Yeah, probably.

275
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,833
[YUUKO]
Excuse me, Miss Sakurai?

276
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,666
How can I help you, Miss Aioi?

277
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,250
I just had a question
for you, if you don't mind.

278
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,750
Go ahead!

279
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,541
Well, about that English test
we had a little while ago.

280
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,708
What is this supposed to be?

281
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,291
[IZUMI] The correct answer
for that one was "Fly."

282
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,416
[YUUKO] No, I'm not
asking about the answer.

283
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,458
I'm wondering if you were
the one who drew this

284
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,916
low-level looking monster.

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,958
Yes, I did. I figured it
would help make the test

286
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,666
a little easier if there
was a visual aid.

287
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,625
[YUUKO] Well then, you have some
pretty awesome drawings!

288
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,958
How kind of you.
But my drawings aren't great,

289
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,416
so I'm sorry if they were
hard to identify.

290
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,750
[YUUKO]
Uhh...

291
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,041
[YUUKO gasps]
I know!

292
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,583
How about I give you a hand,

293
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,250
and draw you a picture that you
can put on the next exam!

294
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,291
I promise it'll be
something really cool!

295
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,666
Sure, okay!

296
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,041
[YUUKO]
Oh! Hey, Mio!

297
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,500
[MIO]
Hm?

298
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,875
Check it out! My drawing is
gonna be in the next test!

299
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,166
[MIO]
Really? Why?

300
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,208
[YUUKO] The teacher
said she would use it!

301
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,750
I bet you could get
yours on there too

302
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,916
if you drew a little doodle
of your own right now.

303
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,041
Yeah, I dunno if I'm cut out
for something like that.

304
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,958
Huh. What do mean?

305
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,500
[MIO]
I'm just not the greatest.

306
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,416
And besides, I gotta
go return this thing.

307
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,375
[YUUKO]
If you say so! 'Kay!

308
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,500
I think I'm gonna draw
a cool-looking dude!

309
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,666
[MIO gasps]

310
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,375
[YUUKO humming]

311
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,041
[YUUKO] Get a load of
this handsome stud!

312
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,625
[MIO gasps]

313
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,791
Wow! He looks so cool!

314
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,041
[gasping]

315
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,375
That's impressive!

316
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,750
I'd say you've got quite
the artistic talent there!

317
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,083
Aw, well it's not that amazing.

318
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,041
Oh wait, maybe it is.

319
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,666
[MIO sighs]

320
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,041
I think I'm gonna name my dapper
doodle dude Hubbu Hunkerson.

321
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,458
[IZUMI]
Wow! That's such a cool name!

322
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,875
[MIO gasps]

323
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,000
[MIO]
None of this is cool!

324
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:29,208
[MIO] I dunno guys, I think it
should look more like this.

325
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,958
--[MIO] Feast your eyes!
--[DRAWING A] Edgy!

326
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,333
Wow, amazing! It looks
like it's from a manga!

327
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,916
You must put a lot
of time and effort

328
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,875
into practicing your art skills.

329
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,875
[MIO]
Well, uh, just a little!

330
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,458
[IZUMI] Remarkable! Show me
some of your other work!

331
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,541
Uh. I don't think so.

332
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,916
[IZUMI]
Oh? But why not?

333
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,333
I would love to see
more of your stuff.

334
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,416
Um. Well. It's just...

335
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
[YUUKO growls]

336
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,208
Gimme that thing!

337
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,791
My drawing is way cooler
than yours, see?

338
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,208
[YUUKO humming]

339
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,416
You straight-up copied me!

340
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,708
You don't know that.

341
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,125
I saw you do it!

342
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,375
"Homage" may be the word
you're looking for.

343
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,166
So you're admitting
that you copied?!

344
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,166
Wow! That's so cool!

345
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,083
You are so easy to please!

346
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,625
All right, then, prepare
yourselves for some of this!

347
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,458
[MIO] Glasses! Every girl
swoons over the cool

348
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,791
and collected demeanor
behind those lenses!

349
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,750
Ah, so he wears glasses.

350
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,208
[MIO]
Huh?

351
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,750
Is his eyesight bad?

352
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,250
He'd probably look
better if he wore contacts.

353
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,458
[MIO] You two don't
understand anything!

354
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,416
[YUUKO]
Y'know? I'll add an extra bit!

355
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
There we go!

356
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,416
[MIO]
They're hanging under his ears!

357
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,416
You so stole my glasses idea!

358
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,791
[YUUKO] Tch. Tch. Tch.
They're sunglasses.

359
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,583
Wow! They're so cool!

360
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,208
Are you kidding me?!

361
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,250
Oh, yeah? Then how's this?

362
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,166
A butler! The perfect gentleman

363
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,458
who serves you tea and
follows your every command!

364
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,291
He'll treat you like the fine
young lady you are!

365
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,125
Huh. Glasses again?

366
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,541
I don't think I
understand the appeal.

367
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,958
[YUUKO laughs] Maybe you should
have taken my contacts idea.

368
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,333
[MIO gasps]

369
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,666
I feel like you're a bit out
of touch, Mio. Tell ya what.

370
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,875
I'll show you what being
cool is really all about.

371
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,833
Some of this, and some of that.

372
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:27,750
Check it.

373
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,541
[MIO screaming]
It's floating!

374
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,250
Wait! Hold on a sec!
Is he supposed to be driving?

375
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,875
Wow! He's so fast and dangerous!

376
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:40,458
[MIO]
You've gotta be kidding me!

377
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,916
They don't understand
coolness at all!

378
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,041
You wanna see something cool?
Then I'll have to show you.

379
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,125
This is a lesson now.

380
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,291
You're gonna see what
true coolness really is!

381
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,250
You'll see! You'll all see!

382
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,666
[MIO grunts]
This is the coolest!

383
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,541
[KOUJIROU]
Yo.

384
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,625
[IZUMI]
Uh...

385
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,916
[YUUKO]
Uh...

386
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,041
[exhales]

387
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:12,083
[MIO]
Oh, no.

388
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,625
[MIO]
I'm just kidding!

389
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,666
[MIO laughs]
I kid!

390
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,958
[WORD-TIME NARRATOR] I drew
this while listening to jazz.

391
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,833
[YUUKO]
Good morning!

392
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,041
Oh. Oh, good morning,
all knowing master.

393
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,333
Don't you even!

394
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,541
[IZUMI]
Listen up class!

395
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,166
It's time for this
morning's quiz,

396
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,500
so take one and pass
it down, please.

397
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,333
[MIO]
Aw man, this sucks.

398
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,750
I was hoping that I could keep
my drawing skills a secret

399
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:12,166
for a while longer, and then
I had to go overboard.

400
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,958
All things considered,
after going berserk like that,

401
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,333
I should be relieved that what I
drew ended up as tame as it was.

402
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:22,916
I guess I should
count myself lucky.

403
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,125
But I'm sure I won't hear
the end of it from Yuuko,

404
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,875
at least for the next few
days. That's okay, though!

405
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,875
I gotta look on the bright side!
And stay positive!

406
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,208
[KOUJIROU]
Yo.

407
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,041
[YUUKO]
Hurry up and pass it back.

408
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,166
Uhh.

409
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,833
Ready, and... begin!

410
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,125
[YUUKO groaning]

411
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,166
[ONOMATOPOEIA]
Yoink! Bang! Zoom!

412
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,708
Hello! It's nice to meet you!

413
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,166
I'm an Onomatopoeia!

414
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,375
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Now you try it!

415
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,916
But don't chicken out!

416
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,958
The next episode of
<i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 6.

417
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,458
Look forward to it!

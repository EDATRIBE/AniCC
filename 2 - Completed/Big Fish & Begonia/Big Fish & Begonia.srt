<i>They call me an old fool.</i>

24
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,668
<i>But I know it’s true.</i>

25
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,173
<i>I can see them in my dreams,</i>

26
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,173

a vast ocean</i>

<i>the ocean calls to us</i>

36
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,300

Look! Sister Leizu’s woven a
new sky for the humans.

51
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,963
Hurry, Chun. The Rite of Passage
is about to begin.

52
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,797
We’ll hurry, Chisongzi!

53

Sister Leizu!

54
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,837
I need to join
the Rite of Passage.

55
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,599
Can we borrow two horses?

56
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,639
I don’t mind if
the horses don’t.

57
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,517
I’ll take this one.

58
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,944
Of course!

59

Wait up, Chun!

00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,911
No way!

Oh, yeah?

66
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,663
Qiu, tell me about
the human world!

67

I loved it there.

68
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,672
I almost didn’t
want to come back.

69
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,251
Maybe you shouldn’t have!

70
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,959
Then who would keep
you out of trouble?

71
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,007
You’re the one
who’s in trouble, slow‐poke!

72
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,027
The Rite of Passage is starting!
Hurry!

73
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,860
Let’s go, come on!

[chattering]

75
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,946
I can’t believe
it’s finally here.

76
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,821
It’s so loud!

77
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,198
Why is everybody being so noisy?

78
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,366
‐Be careful in the human world.
‐I will.

79
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,420
[woman] Chun! Over here!

80
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,752
Coming, Mother!

Hey!

83
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,758
Yeah! Looking good, Grandma!

84
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,768
The seasons pass before us all,

85
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,772
Earth and Heaven, Moon and Sun,

86
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,405
tied by the elements,
we are one!

87
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,073
You’ll be all on your own up
there in the human world.

88
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,571
Here. You need to eat more.

89
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,033
‐Mother, I’m full.
‐I don’t want you to go, Tingmu.

90
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,031
Are you gonna come back?

91
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,248
I’ll be back.
Don’t you worry, OK?

92
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,999
The sun above shines on
the earth below,

93
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,922
and the friendly gods,
their blessings bestow.

94
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,515
For seven days
you will roam the human world

95
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,760
and observe the natural laws
that we govern.

96
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,263
But remember this,

97
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,267
you must not have any contact
with humankind.

98
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,309
Dragon of the sea and sky,

[Grandmother]
Let the gateway be opened!

101
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,485
You heard him.
Keep away from the humans.

102
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,769
‐The farther away the better.
‐I know.

103

You hear?

104
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,651
‐Chun won’t get into trouble.
‐Please.

105
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,821
‐She’s a clever girl.
‐Tell that to Ah King.

106
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,652
Her girl never came back!

107
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,856
What are you waiting for?

108
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,659
I can’t hold this up forever!

109
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,660
[horns blare]

110
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,166
Remember, you must get back to
the gateway in seven days.

111
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,881
‐You can’t be late...
‐Mother‐‐

112
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,002
Or you’ll be left behind.

113
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,996
[child] Here comes the soup!

114
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,258
The soup. Out of the way.

115
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,199
My little girl has grown up.

116
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,295
I should go.

117
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,247
Chun...

118
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,535
Be careful.

119
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,955
I will.

120
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,502
Keep track of the time.

121
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,215
You run along now, Chun. Go on.

122
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,376
Don’t worry. Goodbye.

123
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,220
[woman] Please be careful!

124
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,684
[man] Stay safe!

125
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,728
[mother] Chun! Wait!

126
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,816
The human world is beautiful,
but dangerous.

127
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,576
Remember, your world is here.

I knew that they would,

the same time!

00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,654
[crying]

181
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,759
<i>I was running out of time.</i>

182
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,304
<i>The gateway wouldn’t stay open
much longer.</i>

183
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,562
[yelping]

184
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,188
‐Where?
‐Out there. By the whirlpool.

185
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,568
‐It’s a dolphin.
‐Yeah.

186
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,704
The red one from before.

187
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,321
She’s caught in the net.

188
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,530
I’m gonna try and cut her free.

189
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,198
Go fetch my knife.

190
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,657
‐What about the whirlpool?
‐I’ll be fine. Don’t worry.

191
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,671
Go get it.

192
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,336
Thanks.

193
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,723
Brother, be careful!

194
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,690
[yelping]

195
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,754
OK, all right.

196
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,049
Brother!

197
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,839
I’m trying to save you.

198
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,995
Come back! No!

199
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,168

200
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,021
[panting]

201
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,606
[sobbing] Where is he?
Where’s my brother?

202
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,068
I want my brother back.

203
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,827
I want him back
and everything to be all right.

204
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,160
Please, Brother. Don’t go away!

205
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,827
Come back!

206
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,005
[girl screams]

207
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:03,636
Chun! You’re back!
Thank heavens!

208
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,636
What’s the matter?

209
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,650
‐Chun, are you all right?
‐I’m fine.

210
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,570
Come on. Let’s talk at home.

211
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,529
Thank goodness you’re safe.
I’ve made your favorite dinner.

212
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,453
[thunderclap]

213
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,925
Good morning, Grandmother.

214
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,041
Is Grandfather up?

215
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:49,016
Grandfather, where do humans go
when they die?

216
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,396
Their body is turned back
into the dust

217
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,234
from which they were made.

218
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,609
And their souls?

219
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,864
They go to Ascendance Palace
where they

220
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,067
are transformed
into tiny fishes.

221
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,828
and watched over by Ling Po,
the Lady of Souls.

222
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,210
‐Will we die too, Grandfather?
‐Of course we will.

223
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,209
[chuckles] Death is part of
the natural order of things.

224
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:15,012
In fact, your grandfather’s time
is almost over.

225
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:19,509
‐No! I don’t want you to die.
‐Now, now, sweet child.

226
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,933
Death is not an end just as
birth is not a beginning.

227
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,556
They’re just stops
on the path to eternity.

228
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,645
[Chun] <i>I knew grandfather was
right, of course.</i>

229
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,822
<i>Because I knew I was destined
to inherit his powers,</i>

230
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,282
<i>and how could I do that if he
did not die?</i>

231
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:46,366
<i>But knowing of things true
is not the same as wanting it
so.</i>

232
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,224
[ominous voice] <i>What’s that
you’re playing, child?</i>

233
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,426
Who’s there?

234
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,767
<i>Your flute sounds like
something from another world.</i>

235
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,106
It’s not mine.

236
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,900
<i>The sound is very pleasing.</i>

237
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,943
<i>Where did it come from?</i>

238
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,608
The human world, a boy...

239
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,238
He’s dead now...

240
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,373
because of me.

241
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:30,120
<i>So that’s why you’re here.
A human boy.</i>

242
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,416
<i>Perhaps the Lady of Souls
can help you.</i>

243
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,668
<i>Come back here
at midnight tonight</i>

244
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,799
<i>and bring that bell with you.</i>

245
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,855
<i>Ring it and someone
will come for you.</i>

246
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,981
<i>I will be here waiting.</i>

247
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,941
[animal cries]

248
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,500

CHEN

252
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,804
Did I do that? Sorry.

253
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,221
Where you going?
Kinda late, isn’t it?

254
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,196
[ominous voice] <i>The bell.</i>

255
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,122
<i>That’s it.</i>

256
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,168
<i>Now get ready.</i>

257
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:53,534
[Chun] <i>I had made my choice.
</i> <i>There was no turning back.</i>

258
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,622
<i>The moment I stepped aboard
that boat,</i>

259
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:01,328
<i>I knew my destiny
had changed forever.</i>

You came alone?

264
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,076
Follow me.

265
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,225
Sit.

266
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,676
Thanks. I’d rather stand.

267
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,057
What brings you to
the Island of Souls?

268
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,726
There’s a soul I’m looking for.

269
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,281
The soul of a human boy.

270
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,736
What time was it he died?

271
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,540
It was two days before
the Wheat Harvest.

272
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,748
You need to be sure of the date,

273
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,915
otherwise you’re searching
for a needle in a haystack,

274
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,253
so many die every day.

275
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,510
I’m sure.

276
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,379
It was my birthday.

277
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,256
I know what you’re
trying to do, girl,

278
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,433
and it goes against
the laws of nature.

279
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,432
I don’t care.

280
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,933
I’ve got to save him.

281
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,184
The punishment is harsh
for those who defy nature

282
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,427
no matter who you are

283
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,889
so you should care!

284
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:34,108
But I owe him...
for saving my life.

285
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,149
How very touching.

286
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,075
I’ve been stuck here
for 800 years,

287
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,821
and I’m still not done paying
penance for my sins.

288
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,736
‐But you didn’t‐‐
‐Don’t interrupt!

289
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,073
Let me tell you what
real tragedy is.

290
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,288
Meeting someone you care about
so much you forget yourself

291
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,620
and make a mistake.

292
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,295
So then you go back and you try

293
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,045
to fix it and make things
right again.

294
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:57,595
And then you learn
that fixing it is impossible.

295
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:01,301
We could never undo the wrongs
we’ve done, this I know.

296
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,885
You’re saying you won’t
help me?

297
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,468
I’m saying I pity you.

298
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,393
Besides, resurrecting someone

299
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,021
from the dead doesn’t
come cheap.

300
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,731
What would it cost?

301
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,149
No less than a lovely girl’s
loveliest features.

302
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,645
Your eyes.

303
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,486
[laughs]

304
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:23,029
Now she’s scared.

305
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,705
Don’t want to give up
your pretty eyes?

306
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,909
All right. I’ll take half of
your life instead.

307
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,826
If that’ll save him,

308
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,002
take it.

309
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,764
BINGYIN YEAR

310
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,889
No, no, no! How many times do
I have to tell you?

311
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,761
Not on the carpet!

312
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,523
Why do you have so many cats?

313
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,020
Who else would spend
half of eternity

314
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,731
with an old bore like me?

315
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,946
[Chun] <i>Humankind came
from the ocean.</i>

316
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,239
<i>That’s why people’s tears
and blood</i>

317
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,656
<i>are salty like the sea.</i>

318
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,960
<i>From the moment they are born,</i>

319
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,539
<i>their lives are journey
homeward</i>

320
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,045
<i>though they are
unaware of this.</i>

321
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,717
<i>They think they follow a path
of their own choosing.</i>

322
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,723
<i>They meet, they part.</i>

323
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:31,513
<i>Some grow old, some do not.</i>

324
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,558
LIFE ‐ DEATH

325
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,431
<i>But when they die,</i>

326
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,149
<i>the voice of the sea speaks
to the soul</i>

327
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,111
<i>calling all of them back</i>

328
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:47,074
<i>and each swims off
to their own separate destiny.</i>

329
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,906
[Ling Po]
This is the Hall of Souls,

330
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:57,076
where all human souls
are kept after death.

331
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,207
So many souls.

332
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,999
Will you be able to find him?

333
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,837
He won’t look the same
as he was.

334
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,763
I’ll know him when I see him.

335
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,601
[Chun] <i>I didn’t even
know his name,</i>

336
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:17,193
<i>but I remembered everything
about him...</i>

337
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,769
<i>the scar on his forehead,</i>

338
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,235
<i>the way he looked at me.</i>

339
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:27,065
<i>I searched in there for hours
and hours,</i>

340
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,454
<i>all night long.</i>

341
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,201
<i>And then...</i>

342
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,719
Well, you see?

343
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,425
It requires a piece of your soul
to wake him.

344
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,477
Now your lives are
bound together.

345
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,114
It’s up to you to protect him

346
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:06,109
and guide him through all the
difficulties ahead...

347
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:11,493
until he’s grown enough
to return to his world

348
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,243
and be restored to life.

349
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,956
Now there’s no turning back.
Do not fail him...

350
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,539
or his soul will vanish into
the void...

351
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,378
Forever.

352
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,762
Lazy rascal.

353
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,974
Where were you all night?

354
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,225
And where did you get that?

355
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,195
No.

356
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,361
I’m Chun. Remember me?

357
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,825
I’m the red dolphin you saw.

358
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,161
I suppose you don’t remember
your name.

359
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,238
I’ll just give you a new one.

360
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,329
My name means begonia.

361
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:03,122
One day I’ll look after
all the begonia trees like Mom.

362
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,213
Don’t worry.
You won’t always be small.

363
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,795
You’ll get bigger,

364
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,840
bigger than this fish bowl,

365
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,304
and the mirror, and the table.

366
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,850
and the bed even!

367
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,101
Bigger than this whole room!

368
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,275
And this building!

369
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,193
[man] What’s with all the
racket? Keep it down!

370
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,110
Anyway, I’ll give you
a good name.

371
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,742
You cannot keep a fish here.

372
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,237
Who asked you? Go away.

373
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,790
Wait! I can keep a secret.

374
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,168
You can trust me.

375
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:52,303
Hey! I know a good name for him.

376
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,054
What?

377
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,264
Open the window.

378
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,892
There’s a fish in
the Northern Ocean.

379
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,773
His name’s Kun and
he’s enormous.

380
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,562
I mean so big
that he can’t even be measured.

381
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,555
That’s what
the ancient books say.

382
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,778
So anyway, this Kun is gigantic,

383
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,819
and get this. He can fly. Yeah!

384
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,244
He’s got wings
that are the size of clouds!

385
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,163
Are you finished?

386
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,453
‐Goodbye.
‐Hey!

387
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,084
From now on,

388
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,964
Your name...

389
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,292
is Kun.

390
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,771
Kun?

391
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,154
Kun?

392
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,867
Rain this time of year.
That’s unusual.

393
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,882
It’s salty.

395
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,848
You’re growing.

396
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,231
You wanna play, don’t you?

397
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,569
Remember when a red dolphin
played in the sea with you?

398
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,196
Remember that?

399

400
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,554
You do remember!

401
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,921
Come here.
I wanna try something.

402
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,436
You can fly!

403
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,983
It’s true.

404
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,320
Just like your namesake.

405
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,940
Amazing!

406
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,469
[dolphin cries]

407
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,978
Your family’s calling you.
They want you to come home.

408
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,784
Kun, you keep growing, OK?

409
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,572
I’ll get you home again.

410
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,953
Promise.

411
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,218
Kun?

412
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,814
Mother, were you in my room?

413
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,603
Yes. What’s wrong with that?

414
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,976
What did you do with him?

415
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,983
I threw it out.

416
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,646
Time you stopped playing
with that thing.

417
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,034
Mother, that thing
is a human life!

418
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,283
What? Come back here!
What did you say?

419
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,454
‐Chun.
‐Stop following me.

420
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,453
Where you going?

421
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,665
You all right?

422
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,503
My mother threw Kun away.

423
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,710
Don’t worry.
I know where to find him.

424
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,555
Here! Over here.

425
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,980
Nasty. But I bet he’s there.

426
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,325
Kun?

427
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,860
It’s him.

428
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,575
Grab my feet. I’m gonna look.

429
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,285
What? You can’t go in.

430
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,203
You sit tight.
I’ve got it covered.

431
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,953
Besides, your mother would have
a fit if you got lost too.

432
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,456
Qiu! Be careful!

433
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:38,209
I knew it’d be nasty
but not this nasty.

434
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,543
Qiu,

435
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,297
thanks for doing this.

436
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,008
Kun? Kun?

437
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,144
Rats! Lots of ’em!

438
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,813
Won’t these rats
try and eat Kun?

439
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,142
You can be sure of it.

440
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,147
They’ll strip him to the bone,
they will.

441
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,936
What an enchanting scent.

442
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,409
That provocative perfume.

443
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,078
Smells like... love.

444
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,252
How can I help you, handsome?

445
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,710
What brings you to
my neck of the woods?

446
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,420
‐I’m looking for a fish.
‐A fish?

447
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,090
Well, as it happens,
I’ve seen a fish.

448
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,341
Really? You know where
Kun is then?

449
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,094
That’s no ordinary fish, is it?

450
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:32,347
You got it from the
Lady of Souls, didn’t you?

451
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,350
Ling Po gets all the good people

452
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,982
who turn into fish when
they die.

453
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,890
I get all the bad ones
who turn into rats.

454
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:44,018
I think my rats are much cuter
than her slimy fish, don’t you?

455
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,898
So you’ll help me find him?

456
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,315
No, sorry.

457
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,446
Unless...

458
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,783
You let me borrow your
sweetheart for a dance!

00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,373
Relax. Go with it. Music!

that boys need to learn...

00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,677
how to dance,

466
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,807
and how to control
their own little rats.

isn’t it, the human world?

You’ve been to the human world?

Look. They caught one.

Is he all right?

475
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,973

He’s awesome!

539
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,412
Dearest old friend,

540
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:14,504
can you still remember the day
when we first met?

541
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,340
[Chun] <i>Soon I was to find out
what it had cost my grandfather</i>

542
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,763
<i>to save Qiu.</i>

543
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,182
‐Grandfather.
‐Chun...

544
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,761
come here.

545
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,810
It’s time for me to go.

546
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,265
It’s ’cause of what I’ve done,
isn’t it?

547
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:41,535
No. No, child.
Don’t blame yourself.

548
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,280
It is the natural
order of things.

549
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,743
Life and death are one thread.

550
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,156
I must tell you something, Chun.

551
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,833
The course you have chosen
is not an easy one.

552
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,424
<i>Everyone will be against you.</i>

553
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,961
<i>But if your conscience
is clear,</i>

554
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:03,384
<i>then it doesn’t matter
what others think.</i>

555
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:06,046
<i>Simply follow your heart.</i>

556
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,719
<i>I will become a begonia tree</i>

557
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,564
<i>and reunite with
your grandmother,</i>

558
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,231
<i>but I will always be here
to support you.</i>

559
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,519
[Chun] <i>Grandmother had been
the master of birds.</i>

560
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,574
<i>When she died, she turned
into a phoenix</i>

561
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,069
<i>and kept Grandfather company.</i>

562
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:29,073
<i>Two days after we talked,
Grandfather was gone.</i>

563
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,156
<i>All the birds came to visit
that day.</i>

564
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:36,833
<i>It felt like Grandmother
had come back as well.</i>

565
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,586
Snow in mid‐summer.

566
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,011
The seasons have fallen
into chaos.

567
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,010
Something is coming.

568
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,390
Isn’t this crazy weather?
It’s great!

569
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:58,104
I love the snow!

570
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,440
‐[Qiu] Do you believe God
exists?
‐[Chun] No.

571
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,319
[Qiu] I do.

572
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,776
[Chun] No one’s ever seen him.

573
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:13,784
[Qiu] Humans have never seen us,
but we exist.

574
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,909
I won’t be here when my parents
get as old as Grandfather.

575
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:21,417
Just when they need me
to look after them...

576
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,170
I’ll be gone.

577
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,594
What are you talking about?

578
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,050
I traded half my life away.

579
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,508
You did what?

580
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,643
‐I traded it for Kun.
‐[mother] Chun!

581
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,931
There you are! Get down here
at once!

582
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:36,975
‐I gotta go.

583
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,807
‐Chun!
‐Coming!

584
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,523
[mother] <i>You can’t really
believe my daughter is
responsible!</i>

585
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,154
[father] <i>She’s connected to it
somehow.</i>

586
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,231
[Rat matron] The Elders are
beginning to suspect Chun.

587
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,155
She and Kun are both in danger.

588
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,403
[Qiu] Who are you?

589
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,115
Don’t you recognize me,
handsome?

590
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:52,165
If they find Kun,
your sweetie will be punished.

591
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,619
You must hide him in the river
inside the mountain cave.

592
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,001
Go on. Go on, hurry!

593
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,225
Chun’s in big trouble...

594
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,347
and it’s all ’cause of you.

595
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:19,684
Come on.

596
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,190
As long as you’re here
she’s in danger.

597
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,237
If you care about her
you’ll leave.

598
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,824
Now.

599
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,379
Where’s Kun?

600
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,670
He’s gone.

601
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:51,093
‐Gone? Gone where?
‐I set him free.

602
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,805
He’s in the river.

603
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:55,933
Chun, wait!

604
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,013
I was trying to help you!

605
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,217
[gasps]

606
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,122
A token. Just what I needed.

607
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,833
You’re my ticket to
the human world.

608
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:21,971
Kun...

609
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,137
I thought I’d never
see you again.

610
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,481
Let’s follow them. They’ll know
the way out of here.

611
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,202
[groans]

612
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,991
[panting]

613
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,270
Chun...

614
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,165
IMMORTAL QUEEN MOTHER

615
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,996
I didn’t have parents growing up
like you did.

616
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,748
Just my grandmother.

617
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,422
She does her best
and I love her,

618
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:41,501
but the only thing
I’ve ever really cared about

619
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,708
is you.

620
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,135
Now I realize

621
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,644
how much you care about him.

622
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,563
I was scared.

623
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,148
I don’t wanna see you hurt.

624
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,025
Please let her wake up.

625
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,450
Kun!

626
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:26,339
Kun, it was you who woke me,
wasn’t it?

627
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,171
I don’t ever wanna
lose you again.

628
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,639
She’s OK! Yeah!

629
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,680
Isn’t that great?

630
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,525
Chun’s OK!

631
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,400
[screams]

632
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,207
Your turn.

633
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,218
What a terrible hand!

634
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,512
Well, since you’re here,
you might as well come in.

635
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,310
‐I’m sorry to bother you‐‐
‐Triple.

636
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,361
‐I have a question.
‐What?

637
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:34,323
Why did you give that
human soul to Chun?

638
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,203
It was a trade, not a gift!

639
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,032
If you’re willing to pay
the price...

640
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,407
There’s not a thing in this
world that can’t be traded.

641
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,616
Even half a lifetime?

642
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:48,209
Well, aren’t you
the clever fellow?

643
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,594
So, I can give half my lifetime
and trade for hers.

644
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:57,973
Of course.
However, the price just went up.

645
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,605
You’d have to trade your
whole life.

646
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,810
Fine.

647
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,848
I should warn you, however‐‐

648
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,645
Even that’s not gonna save her!

649
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,940
That little girl’s life is tied
to that great big fish of hers.

650
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,026
When it dies, she dies.

651
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,400
What if the fish returned home?

652
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,197
If the fish goes back...

653
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,870
On the very day it leaves...

654
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,779
She’ll die too.

655
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,541
There must be a way to save her.

656
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,795
Mahjong! I win!

657
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:33,383
Come play a round.
You might even win.

658
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,589
The table’s full.

659
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:36,634
There.

660
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,296
Now it isn’t.

661
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,821
Wow. That’s lucky. I win.

662
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,779
I don’t believe‐‐

663
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,529
[laughs] What’s luck anyway?

664
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,830
Good luck, bad luck.
It’s just fate, really.

665
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,960
It’s all up to you now.

666
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,416
What?

667
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,839
I said it’s all up to you now.

668
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,796
All in your hands.

669
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,773
[whispers indistinctly]

670
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,195
Goodbye. Thank you.

671
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:39,818
You young kids live life

672
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:42,825
like a worthless rock you found
by the side of the road,

673
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,658
while old hags like me
have to rack our brains

674
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,914
figuring out how to
live another day.

675
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,039
Without joy,
what’s the point of a long life?

676
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:15,024
[Chun] <i>What would we give up?</i>

677
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:20,316
<i>What sacrifices would we make
for those we love?</i>

678
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,783
<i>What are we willing
to risk losing?</i>

679
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:29,157
<i>Half our lives,
our family and friends,</i>

680
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:32,416
<i>and the world we know?</i>

681
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:35,879
<i>By the time we ask ourselves
these things,</i>

682
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,591
<i>if we ask them,</i>

683
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:41,011
<i>it’s usually too late to
matter.</i>

684
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:44,431
<i>We already know the answer.</i>

685
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,170
What have you got
to help me forget something?

686
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,796
You sure you want to?

687
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,510
Real forgetting
is not that difficult.

688
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:26,843
But it hurts.

689
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,680
Feeling pain
can be a good thing.

690
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,307
Do you have anything
that’ll make it go away?

691
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,773
There is something.

692
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:37,313
It will make you forget
all your sorrows,

693
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,319
but all your pleasures as well.

694
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,441
Mengpo potion.

695
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:45,573
Well, maybe just some wine.

696
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:54,656
Got something for a hangover?
It’s my first drink.

697
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,797
[shouts] Do you even know
who’s in love with you?

698
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,598
And the things he’s done
for you?

699
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,641
He’s forsaking everything,

700
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,355
betraying everyone...

701
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:17,695
for your happiness!

702
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:26,245
The sea is flowing backwards.

703
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,873
The heavens are angry with us.

704
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:34,155
Only by destroying that creature
will we set things right.

705
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:40,539
[Rat matron] I can tell you
where the big fish is,

706
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:43,378
but first, you will have to
break the seal

707
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:45,883
and allow me to see
the sunlight.

708
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:54,603
Things are getting
awfully messy.

709
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,934
I think it’s time
to clean it up.

710
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,267
Well, baby? Are you ready?

711
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:06,438
<i>♪ The great fish comes
and we must go ♪</i>

712
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,159
<i>♪ To get to higher ground ♪</i>

713
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:12,909
<i>♪ We shall all go up to

[laughs]

721
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,767
Pei, terrible news.

722
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,817
Someone has taken
the Dragon mask!

723
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,786
Chun! Listen to me.

724
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,208
Get away from it right now.

725
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,550
Leave that monster to us.

726
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,092
Don’t hurt him.
He’s not a monster.

727
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:14,177
Ungrateful child!

728
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,895
Mother, forgive me.

729
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:31,033
Feng, why do you stop?

730
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,164
Go. Destroy it!

731
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,989
‐No, I’ll do it.
‐You had your chance.

732
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,339
Kun. Go. Fly!

733
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,008
Don’t let it get away!

734
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,091
Fly, Kun. Fly!

735
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:01,518
Go, Chun! Now’s your chance!

736
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,023
Get Kun back home! Go on!

737
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,353
Heavens, no.

738
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,690
Hurry, Chun!

739
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,653
Get him out of here
while you can!

740
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,863
‐Qiu!
‐Qiu, stop!

741
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,145
You’re not strong enough
to control the gateway.

742
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:14,988
Just watch!

743
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:29,000
We need Pei.
Go find his grandmother. Hurry!

744
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:31,547
I can’t hold on much longer!

745
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:34,511
Chun! Get going!

746
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,262
Go, Kun!

747
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:42,926
I’m finally going back to
the human world!

748
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,560
Thanks for the help, handsome!

749
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:49,228
I’ll think of you from up there.

750
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,398
What have we done?

751
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:55,907
Sorry, sweetie, but without a
token from the human world,

752
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:59,030
you can’t pass through
the gateway.

753
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,214
[groans]

754
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:58,973
Grandfather saved us.

755
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,066
Kun, be strong.

756
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:26,496
Our fate’s have been connected
since the day we met...

757
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,961
and I don’t regret it.

758
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:42,507
Brother Songzi, what will we do
if we don’t find everyone?

759
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:44,177
‐We’ll find them.
‐OK.

760
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,520
Grandma.

761
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,775
Down there!
There’s people in the water!

762
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,227
Help! Help!

763
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,530
Over here!

764
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,821
It’s Tingmu and his sister!

765
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:03,373
Take her first!

766
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,544
Little sister!

767
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,038
‐Has anyone seen Qiu?
‐No, not yet.

768
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:16,297
Tingmu is still out there.
We have to go back.

769
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,549
I’ll come with you.

770
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:20,256
‐Tingmu!
‐Tingmu!

771
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:21,433
Tingmu!

772
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,896
Kun, don’t give up now.

773
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:43,032
You have to fly
and get through the gateway.

774
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:51,212
Go on. I’ll be all right.
Don’t worry.

775
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,918
Grandfather will protect me.

776
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,541
Now go while you can!

777
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,047
Go on!

778
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,263
Down there. It’s that creature.

779
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,505
Quick. We mustn’t let it
get away.

780
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,598
But first, let’s find Tingmu.

781
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:12,604
If that monster escapes,

782
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,847
our whole world will
be destroyed.

783
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,437
We can’t wait.

784
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:29,372
Go, Kun!

785
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:30,622
Go!

786
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,975
Kun!

787
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:46,470
Fly! Fly, Kun!

788
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,021
Grandfather.

789
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,191
Please help.

790
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,362
What should I do? Tell me.

791
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,649
What can I do?

792
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,091
Please save him.

793
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,135
Please, Grandfather.

794
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,450
Grandmother! Here!

795
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,758
He’s done nothing wrong.

796
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,895
Why are you protecting him?

797
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,810
He died saving me,
now I need to save him!

798
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,560
His little sister is waiting.

799
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,061
Tingmu has been swept away
in the flood.

800
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,774
What about his sister?

801
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,197
Run. Everyone, run!

802
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:37,785
Get to higher ground. Go.
To the mountaintop. Hurry!

803
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:40,464
Over here.
Help me make a bridge.

804
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:54,759
The others need us.
We have to go help them.

805
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,651
I’ve got to help my family.

806
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,534
I can’t go with you.

807
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,414
‐My brother!
‐Chi Songzi!

808
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,617
‐Where’s Tingmu?
‐Did you find Tingmu?

809
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:22,707
I’m afraid not.

810
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,092
‐What?
‐I’m sorry.

811
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,137
Mother!

812
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:43,812
Mother, I’m here to help!

813
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:49,150
No! We don’t need any help
from you!

814
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,815
Please, child. Go.

815
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,530
Give me my Tingmu back.

816
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,419
[sobs]

817
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:30,151
I want Tingmu to come back.

818
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,781
Hurry, everyone. We must hurry.

819
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,277
[mother] Stay calm.

820
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,220
Hold the water back!

821
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,598
Let’s go.

822
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:10,226
Hey.

823
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,244
Feng!

824
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,909
[Chun] <i>It’s all my fault.</i>

825
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,590
<i>Everything bad that’s happened
is because of what I’ve done.</i>

826
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,838
<i>The one good will be if
you make it back</i>

827
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:33,921
<i>and live your life again...</i>

828
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:36,218
<i>as it was before we met.</i>

829
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,546
<i>Fly, Kun.</i>

830
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:41,256
<i>Go home and live your life...</i>

831
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,217
<i>a beautiful life.</i>

832
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,320
I’m coming, Grandfather.

833
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:31,956
Ma!

834
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:35,001
‐Tingmu?
‐It’s me! Up here!

835
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:36,335
Tingmu!

836
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:39,007
‐Mama! It’s me!
‐Tingmu!

837
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:41,879
‐Look, it’s me!
‐Oh, Chun!

838
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:47,887
Chun!

839
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:18,482
Finally, the moment’s here.

840
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,506
Why haven’t you left?

841
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:57,352
Here. Sister Leizu
wove this for you.

842
01:20:57,478 --> 01:21:00,438
Try it on. It should fit.

843
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,902
Thank you.

844
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,033
Why am I here?

845
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:07,453
Am I dead?

846
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,239
No, child.

847
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,375
But you’ve lost all your powers.

848
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,080
You can’t stay here.

849
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,332
What about the others?

850
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:18,251
Don’t worry.
Your sacrifice saved them...

851
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:21,594
and now the balance is restored.

852
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:25,130
Go south till you come
to the Southern Sky Pools.

853
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:28,134
You can accompany him
on his journey home.

854
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:31,507
But know that when he returns
to the human world,

855
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:34,805
he won’t remember you
or any of this.

856
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,890
All right.

857
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:39,225
You’ll tell my mother I’m
still alive, won’t you?

858
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:40,811
[Ling Po grunts]

859
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,056
Go now.

860
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:48,193
Thank you.

861
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,068
No need for that.

862
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,155
A deal is a deal.

863
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,491
You should thank the one

864
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,945
who traded away his life
for yours.

865
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:12,263
[Qiu] Chun! Chun! Hey!

866
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,974
Over here!

867
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:17,605
Wait up! I’m coming with you!

868
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,562
I can’t swim!

869
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,000
What you thinking?

870
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:47,298
There’s so many...

871
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,340
So many stars.

872
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,966
Whenever I look up at the sky,

873
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:56,553
it’s like I hear someone
calling to me.

874
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,468
What do you think?

875
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:00,847
There’s something
I’ve been wondering.

876
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,396
Does love last forever?

877
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:04,979
Like the stars?

878
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,977
Yeah.

879
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,613
Once Kun is safe,

880
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,153
we’ll go home, right?

881
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,320
My powers are gone.

882
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,735
I can’t go home.

883
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,659
The human world is nice.

884
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:20,004
Is that where you want to live?

885
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:21,658
With Kun?

886
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:25,498
Impossible.
I don’t belong to his world.

887
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:28,956
I wasn’t asking if
it’s possible.

888
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:32,135
I asked if it’s what you want.

889
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,051
Here.

890
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:43,813
You know, you look cute when
you’re eating.

891
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,024
I know you pretty well by now.

892
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,568
I’ve seen all of you.

893
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,164
When you’re tired,
when you’re angry,

894
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:56,699
when you’re sad,

895
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,162
even embarrassed.

896
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,044
It’s all beautiful.

897
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:03,290
You’re like a brother to me.

898
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,117
Right.

899
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,925
‐You awake?
‐Uh‐huh.

900
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,648
‐You cold?
‐No.

901
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,070
You should sleep.

902
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:37,358
Qiu?

903
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,740
Thank you for always
being there.

904
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:44,287
You treat me better than
anyone else ever did.

905
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,328
[Chun] <i>Will we ever see
each other again?</i>

906
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:06,159
<i>Would you recognize me?</i>

907
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,002
<i>We will meet again.</i>

908
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:11,672
<i>And despite what Ling Po said,</i>

909
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:15,590
<i>I know we will recognize
each another,</i>

910
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:19,301
<i>no matter how much we’d
changed.</i>

911
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,852
Kun!

912
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:20,921
Leave now.

913
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,674
It’s time to go home.

914
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:37,890
Qiu!

915
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,064
Quick! Take hold of my hand!

916
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:44,606
Come on, hurry!
We don’t have much time!

917
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:48,986
What’s happening to you?

918
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,860
I fixed it so you can live...

919
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:52,946
in Kun’s world.

920
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:55,123
But aren’t we going
home together?

921
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,910
I got your life back for you

922
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:59,453
so you can go with him
if you want.

923
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:01,957
‐No.
‐Wait!

924
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:04,132
‐No!
‐Stop it!

925
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:06,134
Chun, listen...

926
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:07,881
Listen to me.

927
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:09,633
Listen.

928
01:31:09,756 --> 01:31:10,966
It’s OK.

929
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,179
‐Qiu.
‐You know this is right, Chun.

930
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:15,549
You have to go.

931
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:18,507
Trust me on this
and I know we’ll meet again.

932
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:23,188
I wish I’d...

933
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,231
I wish I’d held you closer
when I could have.

934
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,941
Just one time...

935
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:29,444
Come on.

936
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:36,485
When I count to three,
we jump, OK?

937
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:39,453
Trust me!

938
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:42,577
One,

939
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,044
two,

940
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:45,495
three!

941
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:52,922
When you see the wind and rain,

942
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:55,338
think of me and
I’ll be with you...

943
01:31:57,387 --> 01:31:59,557
‐Always.
‐Qui...

944
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:02,434
Goodbye, Chun.

945
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:03,597
No!

946
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:29,187
[Chun] <i>Do you believe
in miracles?</i>

947
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:33,110
<i>We each spend countless
cycles waiting...</i>

948
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:38,361
<i>waiting for the chance to enjoy
this adventure called life.</i>

949
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:44,486
<i>It’s so easy to forget how
precious life is, how short.</i>

950
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:49,869
<i>It’s lost in a thousand little
moments of not caring.</i>

951
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:52,708
<i>It doesn’t hurt to be braver,</i>

952
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:57,554
<i>to be more grateful,
more loving.</i>

953
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:02,296
<i>There are many things
I don’t understand,</i>

954
01:34:02,428 --> 01:34:06,218
<i>and many questions
I can never answer.</i>

955
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:09,597
<i>But one thing I do believe,</i>

956
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:12,186
<i>that the heavens gave us life</i>

957
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:17,573
<i>so that each of us can
create miracles.</i>

958
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:33,867
It’s time, my friend.

959
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,344
<i>From now on,</i>

960
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:53,926
<i>you’ll be taking over for me.</i>

961
01:38:55,638 --> 01:38:58,768
In ancient history
there was a tree called Ta‐khun,

962
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:01,600
whose spring (Chun)
was 8000 years,

963
01:39:01,727 --> 01:39:04,227
and its autumn (Qiu) the same.

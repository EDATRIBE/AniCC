1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,416
[KIMURA]
Forget the test!

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,166
I'm gonna die if I have
to study any longer!

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,541
I'm hittin' the arcade.

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,333
[SAKURAI, TAKAO]
Well, we can't let you go alone!

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,500
Hey, Nishikata, are you comin'?

6
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,916
I don't know about you,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,708
but when I study for too long,
it just doesn't stick.

8
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:22,583
Uhh.

9
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,083
Sorry, I think I'm gonna stay.

10
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,541
You've made your choice!

11
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,083
Later!

12
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,458
[KIMURA]
What are you guys gonna play?

13
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,666
[SAKURAI] Whichever gets me
one of those cute figures.

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,625
[NISHIKATA]
Man.

15
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,625
I'm jealous.

16
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,708
But I can't think about them.

17
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,041
I have to get a
good grade on my next test!

18
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,125
Or else!

19
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,708
Hey.

20
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,958
Can I sit here?

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,083
Studying for the test?

22
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,541
Yeah. I am.

23
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,125
[NISHIKATA]
"Studying for the Test."

24
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,833
[TAKAGI] I just saw your
friends leaving as I came in.

25
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,041
Yeah.

26
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,458
We were all studying
together for a while.

27
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,916
[TAKAGI]
Ahh...

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,291
Well I heard them talking,

29
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,750
and I figured they were
on their way to the arcade.

30
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,916
Are you not going with them?

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,583
I don't have time to
play around like they do.

32
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,458
If I don't score within the top
fifty of my grade on this test.

33
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,250
My parents are taking
away my video games.

34
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,208
[TAKAGI]
Huuuh.

35
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,958
I see.

36
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,166
[NISHIKATA]
Oh, no!

37
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,875
Why am I telling her everything?

38
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,166
Now that she knows,

39
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,958
she's totally gonna
distract me from studying!

40
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,458
Nice going, me.

41
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,958
I.. was just kidding?

42
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,625
About what?

43
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,333
Ugh. Forget it.

44
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,750
Anyway, don't interrupt
me this time.

45
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,083
[TAKAGI]
That's mean.

46
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,250
You say that like I'm always
getting in your way.

47
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,375
[NISHIKATA]
That's because you are!

48
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:29,500
Well, yeah. It's 'cuz it's so
fun to tease you, Nishikata!

49
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,458
[NISHIKATA growls]

50
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,416
Should I study somewhere else?

51
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,125
No, if I did that, I'd basically
be letting her win.

52
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,041
I just realized.

53
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,583
You're not studying?

54
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,041
Nope.

55
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,708
I like to limit myself to
two hours of studying a day.

56
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,875
Oh.

57
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,833
[NISHIKATA]
I shouldn't be surprised.

58
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,541
She easily scores in the top
ten of our grade all the time.

59
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:57,375
But, what does
she have up her sleeve?

60
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,208
This is Takagi
we're talking about.

61
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,833
She's definitely gonna
try to mess with me.

62
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,333
I mean, how could she not?

63
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,750
It's practically in her blood!

64
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,708
[TAKAGI]
Hmm? What's up?

65
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,250
Huh? Oh, nothing, just thinking.

66
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,208
It's not like
I was looking at you.

67
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,250
I just kinda
spaced out--

68
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,291
By the way,
you got that one wrong.

69
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,750
Problem six, where it says,

70
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:21,166
"Solve for x over negative
two plus three y." That one.

71
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,750
[NISHIKATA]
You mean it's not 15?

72
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,875
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hmm.

73
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,083
[NISHIKATA]
What? Really?

74
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,041
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hmm.

75
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,416
Substitute the numbers.

76
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,583
Was that wrong?

77
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,791
No. So then...

78
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,333
Here we go.

79
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,083
[NISHIKATA]
Uh... What are you...?

80
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,791
It's easier to
teach you this way.

81
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,125
So, x equals negative 16...

82
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,291
[NISHIKATA]
"Easier to."

83
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,375
She's teaching me?

84
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,500
What is she planning?

85
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,458
Write it out. Go ahead.

86
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,291
There's a negative
times a negative

87
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,375
and don't forget
order of operations.

88
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,000
It's "PEMDAS" remember?

89
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,125
[NISHIKATA]
Oh yeah!

90
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,250
Then let's see.

91
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,583
It's five!

92
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,208
Yep. That's right!

93
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh! And for these next ones,
you should be able...

94
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,375
[NISHIKATA]
She's amazing.

95
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,000
She can figure it out
with just a glance.

96
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,791
Hey. I appreciate this.

97
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,416
I was really struggling
with this page before.

98
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,291
Why don't I teach
you from the beginning?

99
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,958
[NISHIKATA] She's gonna
teach me the whole thing?

100
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,333
I'm saved!

101
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,625
No, something's fishy here!

102
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,875
Why is she being so nice?

103
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,083
She's never this nice
unless she's teasing me!

104
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,875
[NISHIKATA]
Hey, Takagi.

105
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,791
Why are you being
so nice to me today?

106
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:40,541
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

107
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,125
What do you mean?

108
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,750
Well, you're just being
kinder than usual.

109
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,958
So...

110
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,375
Oh... Right.

111
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,708
I am always teasing you
in the middle of class.

112
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:57,083
I would feel really bad if your
grades went down because of me.

113
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,625
Nishikata.

114
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,166
I'm sorry for teasing
you every single day.

115
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,833
Let me help you get
a better grade.

116
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,500
Takagi.

117
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,000
[NISHIKATA]
I don't believe it.

118
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,208
You've finally seen
the error in your ways!

119
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,125
All right, let's go for it!

120
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,541
[TAKAGI]
Thanks for the juice.

121
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,125
[NISHIKATA]
No, thank you.

122
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,541
I made huge progress on my math
today, because I had your help.

123
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,125
[NISHIKATA]
And now I'm less likely

124
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,250
to have my games taken away.

125
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,041
[NISHIKATA]
Maybe Takagi is actually

126
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,041
a good person, after all.

127
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,166
Really.

128
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,708
Thank you so much for today.

129
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,708
Oh, no.

130
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,041
You shouldn't thank me.

131
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:46,083
Since what I taught you,
won't be on the test.

132
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,791
Wha... Hey! Hold on!

133
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,875
[TAKAGI] You're good
at substitution now, right?

134
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,375
[NISHIKATA] Yeah,
and a lot of good that'll do!

135
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,166
Gimme back that juice right now!

136
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,375
[TAKAGI]
Oops, I already opened it.

137
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,083
[NISHIKATA]
You literally just opened it!

138
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,708
[YUKARI]
"Test."

139
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,791
Pass your answer sheets forward.

140
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,041
[YUKARI]
I think I did pretty well.

141
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,541
I should've
gotten a 90 at least.

142
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,166
[MINA]
Hey, Yukari?

143
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,125
[SANAE]
Can you teach me this?

144
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,458
I just can't seem
to do well in English.

145
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:24,625
Huh? You make it sound like
you're good at everything else.

146
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,708
No, I'm just
extra bad at English!

147
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,625
Anyway!

148
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:28,583
Help me out here!

149
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,041
In this part--

150
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,791
Sorry, no can do.

151
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,833
I want to review
before the next test, too.

152
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,916
Huh?! But you always
help me study between tests!

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,416
[YUKARI]
This time is different.

154
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,333
If I can get a 90
or above on everything,

155
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,166
my parents are buying
me any game I want.

156
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,208
Cool. So this part's
been really tripping me up.

157
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,875
Were you listening?

158
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,041
I don't have the time

159
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,666
to teach you guys
this stuff last minute.

160
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,250
[MINA]
Meanie!

161
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,500
Buzz off. Shoo.

162
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,541
What's more important?

163
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,541
Our friendship
or some stupid game?

164
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,708
Yeah, what she said.

165
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,291
Sure you can play video games,

166
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,500
but you can't teach them like
you can your best friends!

167
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,083
Yeah, what she said.

168
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,208
[sighs]

169
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,875
[YUKARI] Now that those
two academic train wrecks

170
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:11,291
will leave me alone,
I should review.

171
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,791
All right, I'm handing
out the next test.

172
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,583
Take one and pass it back.

173
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,750
[YUKARI] Okay, I've thoroughly
reviewed the material

174
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,291
right before the test.

175
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,166
Now that I've got
English fresh in the brain,

176
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,541
this'll be a--

177
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,041

[TEACHER]
Here.

180
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,458
Did you study at all this time?

181
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,291
Next.

182
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,833
Saitou.

183
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,958
You're looking
nervous over there.

184
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:39,875
No, I'm not.

185
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,208
[TEACHER]
Takagi.

186
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,958
Yes!

187
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,875
You did very well, as usual.

188
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,291
[MINA]
She's so smart.

189
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,125
[FEMALE STUDENT]
Sounds like you did fine Takagi.

190
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,708
Can we compare answers later?

191
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:55,833
[TAKAGI]
Sure.

192
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,541
So.

193
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,958
You get a good grade?

194
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,791
Yeah, but not a hundred percent.

195
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,458
[NISHIKATA]
That sounds about right.

196
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,958
But I got this
one in the bag, too.

197
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,958
[TEACHER]
Next up, Nishikata!

198
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,458
Right!

199
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,458
[TEACHER] You can do
a little better next time.

200
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,708
Was it that bad?

201
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,333
[NISHIKATA]
As if you care at all!

202
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,541
You're the one who taught me
stuff that wasn't on the test!

203
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,583
All up on your high horse
because you got a good score!

204
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,458
Whatever!

205
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,291
[TAKAGI]
Hey. Hey!

206
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,541
Guess my score.

207
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,250
And I'll guess yours.

208
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,291
Whoever gets closer will win.

209
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,083
You're always proposing
this stuff out of nowhere.

210
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,791
But okay.

211
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,875
Uh... Is it around 50?

212
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,000
[NISHIKATA]
Hmph!

213
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,041
You underestimate me
too much, Takagi.

214
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,708
You think so?

215
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,666
Okay, then did you
get above 60 percent?

216
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,125
[TAKAGI]
I'll take that as a no.

217
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,708
[NISHIKATA]
How did she know?

218
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,250
Give her your poker face.

219
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,333
Confuse her with your world
class, unwavering poker face!

220
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,833
Did you get above 55?

221
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,625
[TAKAGI]
That's a yes.

222
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,166
[NISHIKATA]
Why?

223
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,583
That leaves everything
between 55 and 59.

224
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,833
[NISHIKATA] I have to keep her
from guessing the exact score!

225
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,416
[TAKAGI]
Okay, then.

226
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,083
Fifty-six?

227
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,625
Or...

228
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,125
Fifty-seven?

229
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,541
Fifty-eight?

230
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,125
Fifty-nine?

231
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,750
Yup.

232
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,833
I got it.

233
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,750
You got a 56.

234
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,500
Uhh. Is that the
answer you're going with?

235
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,166
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hmm.

236
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,208
[NISHIKATA]
Ready to know the truth?

237
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,708
I got a 59!

238
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,916
Sucks to be you!

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,041
I guess you were
sorta close, though.

240
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,875
[TEACHER]
Hey, quiet down.

241
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,000
The only thing that
sucks is your grade.

242
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,666
You're right; I'm sorry.

243
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,291
Fifty-nine, huh?

244
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,208
Looks like I was off by three.

245
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,291
All right.

246
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,541
Now it's your turn to try
and guess my score okay?

247
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,166
If it's within two percent.

248
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,833
Then you're the winner.

249
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,083
[NISHIKATA]
Bring it on!

250
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,500
I'm gonna figure it out
based on her reactions.

251
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,166
The teacher praised
her a second ago,

252
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,875
so I bet that means
she got above a 90.

253
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,458
Is it... like, a 92?

254
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,833
Uh...

255
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:19,833
Huh?

256
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,666
What kinda reaction was that?

257
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,416
How about a 95?

258
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,083
Ninety?

259
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,541
Or was it 92?

260
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,250
Uh...

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,583
[NISHIKATA]
She is so faking it!

262
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,666
I'm not gonna fall for that!

263
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,583
She'd never make
her reaction so obvious!

264
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,958
She's mocking me.

265
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,875
I'm gonna do everything
within my power to win this!

266
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,666
Maybe if I focus more
on her expression.

267
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,833
What? What's wrong?

268
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,000
[TAKAGI]
Hmm? Oh, nothing.

269
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,500
I was just thinking
about something.

270
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:03,333
We've been staring at
each other for a long time.

271
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,541
Why are you turning away?

272
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,583
[NISHIKATA] Aww come on,
that was a cheap shot!

273
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,833
I can't look at you
after you say that!

274
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,208
Think. Just think.

275
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,708
Anything that could clue you in.

276
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:20,750
That reaction she gave me
before was so fake it's painful,

277
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,875
which means she probably
wants me to think she got a 92.

278
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,416
That also means it won't be
between 90 and 94

279
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,583
because they're all within
a two point difference of 92!

280
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,500
And like I thought before,
the teacher praised her

281
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,458
so it must be
above 90 percent.

282
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,041
And she said it wasn't 100,

283
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:40,000
so that means it's gotta
be between 95 and 99!

284
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:40,916
Perfect.

285
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,958
Flawless victory!

286
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,375
Takagi.

287
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,750
I know what grade
you got on the test.

288
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,166
You scored a 97 percent!

289
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,083
[TAKAGI]
Wrong. I got a 92.

290
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,958
[NISHIKATA]
Wha?! Come on!

291
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,208
You really don't
trust me enough.

292
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,958
I guess I gave you
that three-point handicap

293
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,375
for nothing, huh?

294
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,875
[NISHIKATA]
"Bookstore."

295
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,375
[NISHIKATA]
Coast is clear.

296
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,708
Find everything okay?

297
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,833
Four hundred and twenty
yen is your total.

298
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,208
You're quick with
that exact change.

--[NISHIKATA] No, thank you.

304
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,833
[NISHIKATA]
Operation successful.

305
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,458
Now to begin phase two:
Get home and read it!

306
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,458
[TAKAGI]
Oh hey.

307
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,250
Good morning.

308
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,208
[NISHIKATA]
Takagi?

309
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,625
What is she doing here?

310
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,750
I'm taking a walk.

311
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,166
[NISHIKATA]
Did she just read my mind?

312
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,291
What are you doing
here all by yourself?

313
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,458
[NISHIKATA]
This is bad!

314
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,333
I can't let her see
what I just bought.

315
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,791
I'll have to deny it
all the way to my grave.

316
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,375
Oh, nothing.

317
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,625
It's just that I wanted to buy
a book, but they were sold out--

318
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,083
Wait, wait!

319
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,625
What if she saw me
at the register?

320
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,958
Reel it in!

321
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,375
So I decided to buy
<i>Fierce!! Ultimate Soccer!!</i>

322
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,208
volume eleven instead!

323
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,333
The perfect answer!

324
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,833
Boys love that series,

325
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,750
but I've never met a girl
who'd give it the time of day.

326
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,583
You won't care
to ask more about it.

327
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,208
I'm on a roll today.

328
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,375
<i>Fierce-Soccer</i> ?
Cool, let me see!

329
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,666
Huh?!

330
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,500
Uh, but I haven't read it yet.

331
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,250
[TAKAGI] Can I at
least see the front cover?

332
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,708
[NISHIKATA]
No!

333
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,416
'Cuz I haven't had a chance
to look at it yet, either.

334
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
And it's my manga.

335
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,833
[TAKAGI]
Then, let's look at it together.

336
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,125
[NISHIKATA] I happen
to like looking at it alone.

337
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,500
Awww...

338
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,583
[NISHIKATA] I wouldn't
have thought she'd be

339
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,750
this interested.

340
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,500
At this rate,
she's gonna blow my cover.

341
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,833
Better get away
from her and quick.

342
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,875
I'll see you around, Takagi.

343
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,125
Huh?

344
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,500
Hello?

345
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,375
Hey, we ran into each other.

346
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's walk together.

347
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,583
[NISHIKATA]
Okay, fine.

348
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,208
[TAKAGI] It's pretty unusual
to run into someone

349
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:13,125
at the bookstore so far from
home this early in the morning.

350
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,500
[NISHIKATA] I can't let
Takagi see this manga

351
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,291
and yet here it is, three feet
from her in my backpack!

352
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,416
I feel like
my heart's in my throat.

353
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,416
I wish I were home already.

354
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:25,791
[TAKAGI]
Hey.

355
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,500
Nishikata.

356
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,375
Are you lying to me
about anything?

357
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,833
Are you lying?

358
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,375
[NISHIKATA]
Uh, um...

359
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,208
You didn't buy
<i>Fierce-Soccer,</i> did you?

360
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,791
I bet you bought something

361
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,750
that you're so embarrassed to
have, you had to lie about it.

362
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,625
Shut up.

363
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,166
That's not...

364
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,458
It's just some
manga for girls, right?

365
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,125
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i> ?

366
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,333
[NISHIKATA] Okay. There's no
point in denying it now, but...

367
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,500
...how in the world
did you figure it out?

368
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,458
Just luck.

369
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,708
I happened to be passing by

370
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,875
when I saw you at
the register checking out.

371
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,791
And I could see what you got.

372
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,375
[NISHIKATA] She knew the
whole time and was playing me.

373
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,833
[TAKAGI] Is it because
you like the anime?

374
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,958
I didn't know you read
that kind of stuff.

375
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,625
[NISHIKATA]
Uh, wait up!

376
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,750
Please keep it a secret,

377
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,875
I really don't want
anyone to know.

378
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,375
Catching it on TV is one thing,
but if people found out

379
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,416
I'm actually buying
and reading the manga,

380
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,791
I'll be a laughingstock.

381
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:19,583
[TAKAGI]
Hmm...

382
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,083
What should I do?

383
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,041
I mean, you did lie to me.

384
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,250
And that's extra bad,

385
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,916
considering I've never
lied to you before.

386
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,041
But I won't tell.

387
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,333
Huh? You're messing with me.

388
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,250
What do you mean?

389
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,041
I'm serious.

390
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,625
Please don't tell anyone!

391
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,791
Yes, sir!

392
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,458
[NISHIKATA]
Why are you so enthusiastic?

393
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,625
It feels fake!

394
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,750
You're so persistent.

395
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,416
Uh... Then how about this?

396
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,708
I know your secret,

397
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,541
so it's only fair
that I tell you mine, too.

398
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,708
That'll make
you feel better, right?

399
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,666
Since you'll have collateral.

400
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,750
Huh?

401
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,708
I guess.

402
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,583
[TAKAGI]
All right.

403
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,875
Come closer.

404
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,041
[NISHIKATA]
Okay.

405
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,833
Truth is I've always
kind of liked you.

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,333
[NISHIKATA]
Huh?

407
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,166
[NISHIKATA]
Huh?! What did she--?

408
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,041
What?

409
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,416
[laughs]

410
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,041
You're bright red!

411
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,625
You blush so quickly.

412
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,333
It's classic.

413
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,666
Since you lied to me
at the bookstore.

414
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,958
I figured I'd lie
to you as payback.

415
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,583
[NISHIKATA]
Oh, a lie.

416
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,458
You shocked me for a second.

417
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,875
That was a lie.

418
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,666
Of course it was. Duh, right?

419
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,625
See yah!

420
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,458
I'm turning this way now.

421
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,833
"Duh," right.

422
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,416
I'll see you later, bye.

423
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,125
A lie, huh?

424
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,750
[TAKAGI]
Oh, and Nishikata?

425
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,583
I want to read
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i> too,

426
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,375
so let me know when you're
done and I'll borrow it!

427
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,500
[gasps]

428
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:00,583
Ahh! Don't say
it so loud, Takagi!

429
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,750
[NISHIKATA]
"Shelter from the Rain."

430
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,625
This downpour
came out of nowhere.

431
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,750
I wonder if it'll stop soon.

432
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,625
[NISHIKATA]
Hmm...

433
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,125
Well, I hope so.

434
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,791
[TAKAGI] Aww.
Even my socks got wet.

435
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,833
[NISHIKATA gasps]

436
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,291
[TAKAGI]
How about you? Are you dry?

437
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,125
[NISHIKATA] Oh man, I can
kinda see through her shirt.

438
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,166
You hear me?

439
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,833
Uh. Yeah, I heard you.

440
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:28,625
Yeah.

441
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,125
Calm down, just calm down!

442
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,208
If she realizes I'm panicking,
I'll be branded a pervert!

443
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,083
Boy, I sure hope
this rain will stop soon.

444
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,333
I wanna be home before five,

445
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,291
so I can catch an
anime that's on then.

446
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,250
It's <i>Fierce-Soccer</i> , by the way.

447
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,583
Oh yeah?

448
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,583
That's the one you bought
at the bookstore, right?

449
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,041
Or no, I'm mistaken.
That's <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

450
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,458
You promised me
you were never going

451
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,791
to bring that up again!

452
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,208
What, I can't talk about it?

453
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,916
You know your own secret.

454
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,291
I hope this clears up fast.

455
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,000
Uhh. Yeah.

456
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,041
Aw man.

457
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,125
This got a little wet, too.

458
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,250
Hey, do you have
your P.E. shirt on you?

459
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,000
[NISHIKATA]
Uh. Yeah, why?

460
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,708
Do you mind if I borrow it?

461
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,916
I'll give it back.

462
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,291
I want to change out of this.

463
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,791
[NISHIKATA]
Huh? Wait, what?

464
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,625
You want to change
into my P.E. shirt?

465
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,750
Like, right here?

466
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,666
Yup. My shirt's wet;
I feel all gross.

467
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,666
But aren't you--?

468
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,041
And besides,

469
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,041
I know you're having trouble
deciding where to look.

470
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,166
[NISHIKATA]
Busted.

471
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,791
[TAKAGI]
Can you turn the other way?

472
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,083
[NISHIKATA]
Y-Yeah.

473
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,750
[TAKAGI] You managed
to stay pretty dry, huh?

474
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,583
[TAKAGI]
How? Oh.

475
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,708
Did you use your bag
as an umbrella?

476
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,375
[NISHIKATA]
Mm-hmm.

477
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,625
[TAKAGI]
Good thinking.

478
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,250
I had to hold my bike,
so I couldn't do that.

479
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,250
Yeah, that makes sense.

480
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,541
You know,
you can look if you want.

481
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,625
[NISHIKATA]
Huh? I can look?

482
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,458
What are you trying to say?

483
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,208
[TAKAGI]
Because I'm done changing.

484
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,791
Why are you so flustered?

485
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,500
[NISHIKATA]
She's screwing with me.

486
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,500
Hey.

487
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,791
Wanna make a bet?

488
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,416
We can bet on whether
or not the rain

489
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,333
will stop by the time
the town clock strikes five.

490
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,833
The loser has to do
anything the winner wants.

491
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:16,583
Why not?

492
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,208
Okay, what's your bet?

493
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,958
That it won't stop in time.

494
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:20,666
Cool.

495
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,583
Then I bet it will.

496
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,083
[NISHIKATA]
If the rain stops,

497
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,875
I can go home and
watch <i>Fierce-Soccer.</i>

498
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,250
If it doesn't, I get
to order Takagi around.

499
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,166
It's win-win!

500
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,291
There we go.

501
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,208
I feel much better now
that I've changed my shirt.

502
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,916
Thanks a bunch, Nishikata.

503
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,791
Yeah, don't mention it.

504
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,750
It does smell
kinda sweaty, though.

505
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,666
Of course it does,
it's been super-hot out!

506
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,375
Whoa.

507
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,708
That shirt touched my skin
and now it's touching hers.

508
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,833
Agh! Stop it!
What am I thinking?

509
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,750
[meow]

510
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,541
--[TAKAGI] A cat.
--[NISHIKATA] Oh. Hey.

511
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,208
[NISHIKATA] Are you trying
to get out of the rain?

512
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,750
[TAKAGI]
Come here.

513
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,625
He's cute, but be careful.

514
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,083
He scratches.

515
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,250
Do you want me to give
you your shirt back?

516
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,833
No. I'm fine.

517
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,916
[TAKAGI] Why don't
you wear my P.E. shirt?

518
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,833
Huh?

519
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,000
[TAKAGI]
It did get a little wet,

520
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,083
but it's better than
what you've got on.

521
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,500
[NISHIKATA]
And now,

522
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:23,333
The shirt that touched Takagi's
skin will be touching mine.

523
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,458
Are you done yet?

524
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,958
[gasps]

525
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,583
[NISHIKATA] Come on,
you're not supposed to look!

526
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,916
[NISHIKATA] For some reason
this feels naughty.

527
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,375
[NISHIKATA]
It smells good.

528
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,541
[TAKAGI]
I guess I win.

529
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,333
What should I make you do?

530
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,958
[NISHIKATA]
Oh, well.

531
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,375
At least, <i>Fierce-Soccer</i> 'll
be on when I get home.

532
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,625
I'll do what she wants
and hurry back.

533
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:00,750
[TAKAGI]
Oh, I know!

534
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,000
[NISHIKATA]
Huh?

535
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,000
Now that it's stopped raining,

536
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,791
let's go somewhere
before we head home.

537
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,333
[NISHIKATA]
Wait, I wanted to--

538
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,791
[TAKAGI] The bet was, the loser
does what the winner wants!

539
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:10,708
Let's go.

540
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,333
[NISHIKATA]
Why?!

1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,083
[NISHIKATA chuckles]

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,958
[TANABE]
So here, we say,

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,500
"I am Hanako." 

4
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:18,958
As opposed to here,
where we say, "He is a teacher."

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,083
[TAKAGI]
Hey, Nishikata.

6
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,625
Huh?

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,166
What are you doing?

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,250
Stop accusing me, Takagi.

9
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,250
I'm learning.

10
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,666
I swear.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,291
[TAKAGI]
Right.

12
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,041
[NISHIKATA]
"Eraser."

13
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,375
[NISHIKATA]
This'll work well as a spring.

14
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,500
[NISHIKATA]
Now I have all the pieces I need

15
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,666
to make my desktop
jack-in-the-box!

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,166
[NISHIKATA]
Just you wait, Takagi.

17
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,583
Huh?

18
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,375
Hey. What's goin' on?

19
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,416
I'm not sure.

20
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,875
My pencil case just won't open.

21
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,208
Maybe it got dented
when I dropped it earlier.

22
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,500
Do you think you could
try opening it, Nishikata?

23
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,333
[NISHIKATA]
Uh.

24
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,083
Yeah, sure.

25
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,541
You must have loosened
it or somethi--

26
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,958
[shrieks]

27
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,666
What is it, Nishikata?

28
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,875
Huh? Oh, it was nothing.

29
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,083
I'm sorry for shouting.

30
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:29,208
[TAKAGI laughs]

31
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,875
[TAKAGI]
Seriously, Nishikata,

32
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,666
you should see your face.

33
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:36,958
Ugh.

34
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,500
Just shut up.

35
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,000
[laughs]

36
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,166
You suck.

37
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,208
She totally got me.

38
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:51,208
And worse, she got me with what
I was about to get her with!

39
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,125
[NISHIKATA]
Now that I think about it,

40
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,375
it's unusual for Takagi
to ask me for help.

41
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,208
Why didn't that raise
any red flags in my mind?

42
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,125
I have to plan my next move.

43
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,583
But how am I supposed to
embarrass her of all people?

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,458
Hey.

45
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,000
Uh.

46
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,541
What's up?

47
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,500
Can I borrow your eraser?

48
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,416
I forgot mine.

49
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,208
How did you forgot your eraser?

50
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,375
Takagi, you're such
an airhead sometimes

51
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,333
Guess so.

52
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,166
Thank you very much.

53
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,666
That reminds me.

54
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,416
[NISHIKATA]
Hmm?

55
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,583
Know what I heard?

56
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,375
If you take your eraser,

57
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,833
write the name of your crush
on it, and use it all up,

58
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,250
they'll like you back.

59
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,958
Yeah, I've heard
that before too.

60
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,750
Only a little kid would
actually believe it, though.

61
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,958
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

62
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,583
A kid, huh?

63
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,291
Huuh...?

64
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,208
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

65
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,625
Ahh.

66
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,791
Huh?!

67
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,291
What do you see?

68
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,166
Huuuh?

69
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,500
Huh? Ohh...

70
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:52,541
Wha...

71
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,500
What are you doing?

72
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,125
[laughs]

73
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,250
Nothing's written
on there, right?

74
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,708
C'mon.

75
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,708
I'm not some dumb little kid
who'd believe that works.

76
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:12,083
Oho? You sure about that?

77
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,375
There's no way.

78
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,833
You're just making fun
of me again, aren't you?

79
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,250
Yeah?

80
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,916
You think so?

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,541
[NISHIKATA]
Did I actually?

82
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,000
Did I actually write
something on there?

83
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,833
And then just forget that I did?

84
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,333
You're done with it,
so can you give it back now?

85
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,666
[TAKAGI]
Sure.

86
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,250
It wasn't me, I swear!

87
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,083
Someone else must have gotten
a hold of it and then...

88
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,875
I knew there was nothing
written on that thing!

89
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,208
Hey!

90
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,625
You didn't forget your eraser,
it's right there!

91
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,125
No yelling in class.

92
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,166
I'm sorry, sir.

93
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,875
[TAKAGI laughs]

94
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,708
Not only did you freak out,
but you got in trouble!

95
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:13,083
I think that's enough
messing around for one class.

96
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,458
I should be the one saying that!

97
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,958
[TAKAGI]
Mr. Tanabe?

98
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,875
May I go to the bathroom?

99
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,500
[TANABE]
Fine.

100
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,916
[NISHIKATA]
There's gotta be something.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,291
Something I can do
to embarrass her.

102
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,750
Anything!

103
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,041
Huh?

104
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,291
[NISHIKATA]
That's it!

105
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,833
I'll write someone's name on
Takagi's eraser and make fun

106
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,041
of her for it when she comes
back from the bathroom!

107
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,916
Genius!

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,375
Just one question:

109
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,125
Whose name should I write?

110
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,291
Huh?

111
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,083
[NISHIKATA]
There's a name on it already?

112
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,375
[NISHIKATA]
Should I not look, then?

113
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,875
Maybe just a tiny peak.

114
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,291
[NISHIKATA]
"Lo"? "Lo"?

115
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,333
Then that means...

116
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,708
[NISHIKATA]
...it's not my name.

117
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,458
[NISHIKATA] Not that I'm,
like, upset or anything.

118
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,750
[NISHIKATA]
Come on!

119
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,500
[NISHIKATA]
I'm gonna look at it!

120
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,833
I have to know!

121
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,541
[NISHIKATA]
I can't believe it!

122
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,791
She got me again!

123
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,958
[TAKAGI] Nishikata,
that face was priceless.

124
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:21,875
And man, you acted
exactly how I thought.

125
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,958
I just have to tease you.

126
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,750
I can't help it.

127
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,041
Oh yeah?

128
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,583
Well just you wait, Takagi!

129
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,166
Mark my words, one of these
days I'm gonna get back at you

130
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,083
and embarrass you so bad!

131
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,250
Like that'll ever happen.

132
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,125
[NISHIKATA] You don't
think I can do it, huh?

133
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,291
[TAKAGI]
Well, yeah.

134
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,666
[NISHIKATA]
I'm serious!

135
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,666
You better be on your guard.

136
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,708
I think it's impossible.

137
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,125
But keep dreaming.

138
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,875
You can't even win
fifty-percent odds.

139
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,458
[NISHIKATA]
"Fifty-percent odds"?

140
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,375
Whaddya mean?

141
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,291
[TAKAGI]
Not telling.

142
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,125
Man, day duty is
such a pain in the butt.

143
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,333
[yawns]

144
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,958
Why do I have
to go to school early

145
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,166
to clean the blackboard
and write a lesson log?

146
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,000
I take it back,
day duty's awesome!

147
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,166
I guess what they say is true.

148
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,333
The early bird gets the worm!

149
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:22,583
I thought this was money,
not some stupid arcade token.

150
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,458
[NISHIKATA]
"Day Duty." 

151
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,833
[NISHIKATA]
I just got a great idea!

152
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,166
I should use this opportunity

153
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,125
to rig Takagi's desk
with some kinda prank.

154
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,958
Just thinking about it
woke me up a little.

155
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,291
Ta...

156
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,875
[moans]

157
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,791
My plan is ruined,
she's already here.

158
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,500
Wait, why?

159
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,458
I don't see anyone here.

160
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,791
That's weird.

161
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,333
Did I just imagine
it or something?

162
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,083
[NISHIKATA]
No, she's definitely here!

163
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,166
My Takagi-sense is tingling!

164
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,583
But where is she hiding?

165
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,958
[NISHIKATA]
And that was a close one.

166
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,916
I was about to let my guard
down and start humming.

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,166
But not today!

168
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,333
Where are you?

169
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,958
Show yourself.

170
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,333
[gasps]

171
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,208
[NISHIKATA] You're making
this too easy, Takagi.

172
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,875
I can see the name on
your shoes under the desk.

173
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,375
You're probably
planning to surprise me

174
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,583
when I go up to
clean the blackboard.

175
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,583
But I won't give you the chance.

176
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,083
Ahh...

177
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,916
Day duty is such a pain, I don't
feel like doing anything!

178
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,041
Not like anyone will notice if
I don't clean the board anyway.

179
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,666
[NISHIKATA]
Ooo, stings, doesn't it?

180
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,166
You must be mortified that this
silly plan of yours didn't work.

181
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,250
[NISHIKATA]
I can hardly contain myself!

182
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,125
I wanna see the look
on her face so bad.

183
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,416
But wait...

184
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,083
Would Takagi really make
such an amateur mistake?

185
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,333
This is hide-and-seek 101!

186
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,208
No!

187
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,500
She wouldn't!

188
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,041
Which means that's a trap!

189
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,208
That was close.

190
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,958
She's devilish, that one.

191
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,000
Gotta stay on my toes.

192
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,791
So if she's not there,

193
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,500
where is she?

194
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,041
She's gotta be nearby.

195
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,000
She wouldn't miss
the opportunity.

196
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
[NISHIKATA]
I don't see her in the hallway,

197
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,583
so there's only one place left.

198
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,625
[NISHIKATA]
Welp!

199
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,416
I guess I'll go to the bathroom!

200
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,833
Now pretend I'm not here.

201
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,375
I got you!

202
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,291
[NISHIKATA]
What?

203
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,375
She's not there!

204
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,500
Huh?

205
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,791
[NISHIKATA]
Well that was a waste of time.

206
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,333
What the heck was I doing?

207
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:31,916
Hey!

208
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,666
[gasps]

209
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,000
[laughs]

210
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,125
Are you okay?

211
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,208
Come on!

212
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,125
I didn't look
behind the curtain?

213
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,000
Totally fooled you, didn't I?

214
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,916
If you're up real close,

215
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,291
you can see through the curtain,

216
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,333
so I saw you the whole time.

217
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,208
[NISHIKATA]
Not fair!

218
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,500
She looks so happy!

219
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,041
This sucks!

220
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,583
[TAKAGI]
Ahh, that was fun.

221
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,791
Just thinking about the look
on your face makes me wanna...

222
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,000
[laughs]

223
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,500
This was worth
waking up early for.

224
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,916
[NISHIKATA]
Just to mess with me?

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,416
Yup!

226
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,000
[NISHIKATA] I can't
believe she got me again.

227
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,333
[TAKAGI]
Hey, Nishikata.

228
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,750
Huh?

229
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,458
Know what?

230
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,208
It's just the two of us
in this quiet classroom.

231
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,458
Doesn't it feel like we're
the only ones in the world?

232
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,958
I think it does,

233
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,583
and I hope it stays this way.

234
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,708
Then, uhh, Takagi?

235
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:52,375
Does that mean that you,
maybe, like, like...

236
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,666
Good morning everyone!

237
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,583
How about this
weather am I right?

238
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,916
[YUKARI]
Jeez.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,416
I'll never understand
how you feel so energetic

240
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,291
in the morning, Mina.

241
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,875
[MINA] Huh? And how else am I
supposed to feel, smarty-pants?

242
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,416
[SANAE]
Tired?

243
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,875
[MINA]
You too, Sanae?

244
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,708
Saying you're tired makes
your happiness go away!

245
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,333
I saw it on TV!

246
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,541
Not everything on TV is true.

247
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,250
You can't actually believe that.

248
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,750
[MINA]
Well, I do!

249
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,541
It's better to be
cheerful anywa--

250
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,833
Stop it.

251
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:23,708
[MINA]
Ow, ow, ow.

252
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,375
That hurts, can you like, not?

253
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,291
Just leave her alone.

254
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,041
[MINA] You two would
feel better if you smiled!

255
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:29,916
See?

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,416
Ignore them.
You were saying?

257
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,875
[NISHIKATA]
Huh?

258
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:33,916
It was nothing.

259
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,458
Forget it.

260
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,875
Huuuuh?

261
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,041
Speaking of forgetting things.

262
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,708
Did you clean the board?

263
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,291
Ahh! I forgot!

264
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,875
[laughs]

265
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,625
[NISHIKATA]
"Funny Face."

266
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,625
[NISHIKATA] How am I gonna
pull one over on Takagi?

267
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,375
What am I gonna do?

268
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,125
Think!

269
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,333
[NAKAI]
Hey, Nishikata.

270
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,833
What are you staring
at the mirror for?

271
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, hey, Nakai.

272
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,541
You practicin' putting on
a cool face or somethin'?

273
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,458
No, that's lame.

274
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,916
A funny face, then?

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,333
[gasps]

276
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,250
[NISHIKATA]
Of course. That's it!

277
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,875
So like this?

278
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,250
By the way, I've been
meaning to ask you something.

279
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,500
You're pretty close
with Takagi, aren't you?

280
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,125
So I was wonderin',
like, you into her?

281
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,041
[NISHIKATA snickers]

282
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,208
Well, he's clearly ignoring me,

283
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,458
which means I must
be on the right track.

284
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,458
Yo, dude.

285
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,833
You totally like
Takagi, don't you?

286
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,666
[laughs]

287
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,250
That face was so weird, man!

288
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,541
[NISHIKATA]
I had no idea I had

289
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,375
such talent lying
dormant within me.

290
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,458
Okay, everyone settle
down, let's get to work.

291
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,583
Open your books to page 36.

292
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,875
[NISHIKATA]
This is perfect!

293
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,750
We just so happen to
have the scariest teacher,

294
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,625
Mr. Tanabe, right now!

295
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,625
I'll use my funny face to
make you laugh so hard,

296
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,875
you'll get in deep
trouble, Takagi!

297
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:10,625
[chuckles]

298
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,083
[NISHIKATA] Oh man, I
wanna make Takagi laugh now.

299
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,375
No. I have to be patient.

300
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,333
I have to wait until she starts
a conversation to mess with me,

301
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,291
like I planned.

302
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,916
The best moment to mess
with someone is when

303
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,333
they're about to mess
with someone, themselves.

304
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,458
They'll never expect it then!

305
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,500
And that's when I strike!

306
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,708
All right, girl, come at me.

307
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,541
I'm wide open!

308
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,208
Hey, uhh, Nishikata?

309
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,208
[NISHIKATA]
Here it is!

310
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,500
Whatever do you need, Takagi?

311
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,583
[NISHIKATA]
Take this!

312
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,833
Huh?

313
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,375
[TAKAGI]
Hmmm...

314
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,750
[NISHIKATA]
Huh?

315
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,000
[NISHIKATA laughs]

316
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,166
Hey.

317
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,000
How many times do I have
to tell you to be quiet?

318
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,083
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

319
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,083
[NISHIKATA]
He's so scary.

320
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:10,125
[TAKAGI laughs]

321
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,000
[NISHIKATA]
This sucks!

322
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,958
I wasn't sure what you
were trying to do at first,

323
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,250
but now, I get it.

324
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,291
You're not very creative.

325
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,166
Wha?

326
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,833
If you really wanna be funny.

327
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,291
You should push
your eyebrows up, like this.

328
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:27,208
Oh, and do this
with your cheeks, too.

329
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,458
So like this?

330
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,708
[TAKAGI]
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,458
Okay, you're getting there.

332
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,791
Honestly, it's looking better
than before already.

333
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,208
[NISHIKATA]
What is happening?

334
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,333
Now stick your lips
out like a duck bill.

335
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,875
That'll be super funny.

336
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,375
[NISHIKATA] I wanted to make
a silly face to make her laugh.

337
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,916
And now I'm getting pointers
on how to do it from my target.

338
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,291
It's kind of humiliating.

339
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,666
Whatever!

340
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,708
All I want is for Takagi
to laugh and get in trouble!

341
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,500
I couldn't care less who
helps me make that happen!

342
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,958
Like this?

343
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,958
Yeah, that's perfect!

344
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,041
It looks way better now!

345
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,041
[NISHIKATA]
Okay.

346
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,000
Then why aren't
you laughing yet?

347
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,041
I'll laugh really hard

348
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,250
if you turn to your
left right now.

349
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,125
[NISHIKATA]
All right.

350
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,166
This is the moment.

351
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,583
Here we go!

352
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,708
What are you doing, Nishikata?

353
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,416
[NISHIKATA]
Sorry!

354
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,916
I'm really sorry, sir!

355
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,333
[TANABE]
Always with the antics.

356
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,500
Take my class
seriously, will you?

357
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,583
I will.

358
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,916
And sorry again.

359
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,708
[TAKAGI laughs]

360
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,416
My stomach hurts from laughing!

361
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,041
[NISHIKATA] I guess I
technically got her to laugh,

362
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,583
like I wanted.

363
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,250
But she won that round.

364
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,166
Hey. Hey, Nishikata.

365
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,166
[NISHIKATA] Okay,
that's enough playing around.

366
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,541
If I make Mr. Tanabe
angry again, he'll kill me!

367
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,958
I gotta make sure
I don't get involved

368
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,250
with Takagi for
the rest of this class.

369
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,375
You finally decided
to look at me.

370
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,916
We should totally
have a staring contest.

371
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,375
One. Two. Three.

372
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:42,791
[NISHIKATA laughs]
That face is so weird!

373
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:43,833
[TANABE]
Nishikata!

374
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,791
What did I say?

375
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,750
[NISHIKATA] Whenever Takagi
gets my heart racing,

376
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,375
things don't play out
the way I want them to.

377
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,625
[MINA]
"One Hundred Yen."

378
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,083
Ugh.

379
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm exhausted, yet again.

380
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,250
What did I say?

381
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,041
Don't say you're tired,
it'll make things worse!

382
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,875
It takes your happiness away!

383
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,666
Yeah, whatever.

384
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,250
[gasps]

385
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,041
What's up?

386
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,416
Are you doing okay?

387
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,416
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

388
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,041
You two go on ahead.

389
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,125
Why?

390
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,041
I'm just feeling
a little tired, is all.

391
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,416
By your rules,
there goes your happiness.

392
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,916
Huh?

393
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
[chuckles]
Yeah, guess you're right.

394
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,375
Mina.

395
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,375
Care to tell us what you're
hiding under your foot?

396
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,791
Whatever do you mean?

397
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,250
I always stand like this.

398
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,666
Wait, no fair!

399
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,958
I found that hundred yen!

400
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,833
What happened
to finders keepers?

401
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,083
You are so greedy.

402
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,666
[SANAE]
Mina.

403
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,541
Come on.

404
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,916
It's a token.

405
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,333
[sighs]

406
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,416
It must have turned into
that when I said I was tired.

407
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
I told you it was real.

408
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,666
[YUKARI sighs]

409
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,000
You know that's not
how the world works.

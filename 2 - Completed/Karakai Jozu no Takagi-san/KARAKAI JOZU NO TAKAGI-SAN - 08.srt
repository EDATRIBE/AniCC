1
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,250
If you're ready, hold on tight.

2
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,791
Sure.

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,291
[NISHIKATA]
When we first started practicing

4
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,208
tandem riding, the hardest part
was Takagi holding on to me.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,083
[gasps]

6
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,583
Don't tickle me; you're
gonna make us fall over!

7
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,375
I wasn't tickling you.

8
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,375
I just held on a little.

9
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,541
But if you thought I was,
your ribs are ticklish.

10
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,250
It's just because of how
your hands are touching them.

11
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,375
Change the way
you're holding on.

12
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,250
[TAKAGI]
How's this?

13
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,541
[gasps]

14
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,708
Don't you think
that's a bit too close?

15
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:54,666
No.

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,458
I'll fall if I'm not close.

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,333
Oh, come on.

18
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,666
Don't get self-conscious.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,541
[gasps]

20
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not!

21
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,208
I'm just overheating when
you're right up against me,

22
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,333
it's already a
thousand degrees.

23
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:08,333
Anyway, just do me a favor
and don't grab on so tight.

24
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:11,791
But you literally told me to
hold on tight a minute ago.

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
All right, then.

26
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,750
Why don't you just show me how
you want me to hold onto you?

27
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:28,916
Hurry it up.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,166
We're gonna run out
of time to practice.

29
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,500
Uh. I guess something
like this works?

30
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,916
[NISHIKATA] But now
we've overcome our hurdles!

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,708
And finally...

32
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:48,333
[TAKAGI laughs]

33
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,916
[NISHIKATA]
...we've mastered tandem riding.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,208
Yeah.

35
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,958
Looks like we're done.

36
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,625
I mean, we wanted to learn
to ride together, and we did.

37
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,666
So there's no need
to practice anymore.

38
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,500
Uh. Mm-hmm.

39
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,458
Are you, by any chance,
like, kinda bummed?

40
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,791
Huh?! I dunno.

41
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,500
Relieved, then?

42
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,208
[NISHIKATA] It'd be rude to
say I'm relieved we're done,

43
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,375
but if I say I'm bummed out,

44
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,291
she's just gonna
tease me even more.

45
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,250
A little bit of both options.

46
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,000
Hey. No fair.

47
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,166
Well, what about you, huh?

48
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,041
What about me?

49
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,416
Well, I'd say
I'm not that bummed out.

50
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,666
Oh, cool.

51
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,916
[chuckles]

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,291
Tomorrow, let's finish up
our homework at the library.

53
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,833
Huh?

54
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,625
We can check each other's work.

55
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,916
Uh. Okay.

56
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,208
Vacation's ending. Real soon.

57
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,375
On the other hand,
our next term is starting.

58
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,041
Yeah.

59
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,500
I wonder when we're
actually getting that typhoon.

60
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,625
[NISHIKATA]
"Typhoon."

61
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,125
Oh man, it's so windy!

62
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,375
[NISHIKATA]
Whoa, that's really high!

63
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,916
This typhoon is crazy!

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,166
[laughs]

65
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,166
I don't know why,
but I feel really excited!

66
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,291
[laughs]

67
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,250
Now wind,
blow harder and harder!

68
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,791
[NISHIKATA]
Perfect timing!

69
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,166
I feel like I'm controlling
this huge gust!

70
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,041
So awesome!

71
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,166
Now, gale.

72
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,916
I command thee...!

73
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,875
[shrieks]

74
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,958
Morning, Nishikata.

75
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,625
Good morning, Takagi.

76
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,916
[TAKAGI] This wind is
really something, huh?

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,291
I probably should have
tied my hair back.

78
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,791
Uh. Yeah, I bet that
would have helped.

79
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,083
I was just checking
the direction of the wind.

80
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,833
You realize I didn't
ask what you were doing.

81
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,333
[NISHIKATA]
Come on!

82
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,541
Why does she always have to see
me at the worst possible times?

83
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,208
[TAKAGI]
So what were you doing?

84
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,541
I just said, I was checking
the direction of the wind.

85
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,625
Weird.

86
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,916
That's not what
it looked like to me.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,666
[laughs]

88
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,458
"Now wind, blow
harder and harder!"

89
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,416
I could have sworn I heard that.

90
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,416
Me? No way, that would
just be ridiculous.

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,583
Watching someone else do it

92
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,250
makes me realize how
embarrassing it is.

93
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:20,041
So, why were you checking the
direction of the wind, then?

94
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,500
I just thought it'd
be good to know.

95
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,208
Given that the wind's so strong.

96
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,500
So I won't fall over!

97
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,666
Yeah?

98
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,083
But you had both hands
raised up so high.

99
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,500
Like, "Wow!

100
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,250
I feel like I'm controlling
this huge gust of wind!

101
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,250
So awesome!"

102
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,083
I'd bet that's what
you were thinking.

103
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,083
[NISHIKATA]
That's even more embarrassing.

104
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:46,208
By the way, do you
notice anything different?

105
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,541
You're not riding your bike?

106
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,166
That it?

107
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,041
Uh-huh.

108
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,250
Question is:

109
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,333
Why do you think
I'm not riding it today?

110
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,958
Because there's a typh--

111
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,416
If you guess right,

112
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,666
I'll keep quiet about your
little performance earlier.

113
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,000
I won't tell a soul.

114
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,541
[gasps]

115
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,791
We've been over this, I was
checking the wind's direction.

116
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,125
[TAKAGI] You have until that
plastic bag gets here.

117
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:14,916
Are you serious?

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,583
I have a time limit?

119
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,625
I have no choice
but to get this right.

120
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,458
She wouldn't be asking
such a simple question

121
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,583
if there wasn't a twist.

122
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,333
So I can rule out
anything obvious like,

123
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,000
"It's dangerous to ride
a bike in a typhoon."

124
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,583
[NISHIKATA]
Think. Think!

125
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,708
Some other problem that
a strong wind would cause.

126
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,958
Bike.

127
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,250
Wind.

128
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,416
[gasps]

129
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,875
Could it be her skirt?

130
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,666
Your... Your...

131
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,541
[NISHIKATA] I can't bring
myself to say that out loud!

132
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,875
It's too awkward!

133
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,291
And... you are out of time.

134
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,625
The correct answer is

135
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,833
that it's dangerous to
ride a bike in a typhoon.

136
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:58,833
Sorry!

137
00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,791
[NISHIKATA]
Huh?

138
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,750
What?

139
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,041
Seriously?

140
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,666
You read into things too much.

141
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,625
Okay.

142
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,291
Let's get going.

143
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,625
This wind is so strong.

144
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,916
Yeah.

145
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,291
Kinda gets you
excited, doesn't it?

146
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:30,541
Yeah. I mean, I don't really
know what you're talking about.

147
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,916
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,083
Come on.

149
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,916
Doesn't it make you
want to shout?

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,750
Raise your hands to the sky!

151
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,083
[laughs]

152
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,291
"Now wind,
blow harder and harder!"

153
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,375
[NISHKATA groans]

154
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,541
This sensation!

155
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,041
It's like I'm
controlling the storm!

156
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,958
[TAKAGI] I am the great
Wind King, ruler of this world!

157
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,625
I shall blow the school away
to the far ends of the earth!

158
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,291
[laughs]

159
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,708
Hey, I never went that far!

160
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,708
[gasps]

161
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,083
So you weren't just
checking the wind's direction.

162
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,291
Uh...

163
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,416
Well, whatever.

164
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,083
Huh?

165
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,458
Let's race to school!

166
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,750
Hurry up!

167
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:14,791
So strong!

168
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,166
[NISHIKATA]
Huh? Wait up, Takagi!

169
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,708
You always try
to get a head start!

170
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,583
For some reason, Takagi was
really energetic this morning.

171
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,291
[NISHIKATA]
"Marathon."

172
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,041
All right!

173
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,250
Let's do this!

174
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,166
How are you so full of energy?

175
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,041
I thought you hated marathons.

176
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:35,833
Nah.

177
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,333
I'm looking forward to it!

178
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,250
In fact, let's race, Sanae!

179
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,625
Okay.

180
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,916
How about if I win, you
don't get to eat any lunch?

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,958
Yeah.

182
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,875
Bring it on!

183
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,583
Wait. You sure?

184
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,291
You know Sanae is
really fast, don't you?

185
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,916
Yeah, but I'm in the zone!

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,166
Uh-huh...

187
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,041
[sighs]

188
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,625
What's the point of
running a marathon?

189
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,458
It's not like we're ever
gonna run this much

190
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,708
after we're finished
with school.

191
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,333
It doesn't make any sense.

192
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,666
So lame.

193
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,458
You said it, dude.

194
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,958
You look
enthusiastic, Nishikata.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,625
[chuckles]

196
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,666
[TAKAGI]
Nishikata.

197
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,458
You sure you're up to this?

198
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,541
Ha! 'Course I am.

199
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,666
It was my idea to begin with.

200
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,916
'Kay.

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,666
See ya later!

202
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,250
You and Takagi
sure are close.

203
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,875
Huh?!

204
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,500
Are you going out with her?

205
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,708
What are you talking about?

206
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,625
Don't get the
wrong idea, Kimura!

207
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,041
I'm only competing with her

208
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,958
because the winner gets
to order the loser around!

209
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,291
Wait.

210
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,958
You're racing each
other in the marathon? But...

211
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,000
It's none of your business.

212
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,416
Judging by that reaction,

213
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,291
I wouldn't put money on
the two of them going out.

214
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,208
Yeah, I mean,
if they were going out...

215
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,000
Nakai! How are you feeling?

216
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,125
Pretty darn good!

217
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,791
And it's all thanks
to you training

218
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,916
with me every single day!

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's destroy this marathon!

220
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,708
Yeah!

221
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,916
[KIMURA] They'd be acting
something like that.

222
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,041
[TANABE]
All right, gather 'round!

223
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,291
[sighs]

224
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,208
I'll never understand
why we have to do this.

225
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,875
Just accept it already, Kimura.

226
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,041
[NISHIKATA]
Empty your mind.

227
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,708
Run with an empty mind.

228
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,500
Calm yourself and avoid
wasting unnecessary energy.

229
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,625
[NISHIKATA]
I've got you this time, Takagi.

230
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,125
I've jogged every evening

231
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,083
for over two weeks
just for this day!

232
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,500
[NISHIKATA]
Come rain.

233
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,416
Come wind!

234
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,875
There's no way I'm gonna
lose after all that prep.

235
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,000
[NISHIKATA]
Oh! Empty your mind.

236
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,791
Empty your mind.

237
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,166
Hey, Nishikata!

238
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,125
I figured you would have
sprinted way ahead of the pack.

239
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,833
Oh yeah?

240
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,458
Sorry, but pacing
yourself is the key.

241
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,041
But clearly you don't get it.

242
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,208
You look unfazed, but you sped
up because you couldn't see me

243
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,208
ahead of you
and panicked, right?

244
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:24,916
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,166
I was running slow until now

246
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,958
because I wanted to
give you a handicap.

247
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:29,958
Handicap?

248
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,208
Wait, did she just read my mind?

249
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,333
Well, I'm going on ahead.

250
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,791
Huh?

251
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,125
[MINA groans]

252
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,583
I can't have lunch.

253
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,791
And I'm already so hungry.

254
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,750
I started out too fast.

255
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,916
[NISHIKATA]
That's right.

256
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,041
You'll see, Takagi.

257
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,375
If you keep running that fast,

258
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,666
you're gonna lose
your pace just like her!

259
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,583
And all I have to do
is keep up my pace.

260
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,500
[NISHIKATA]
Wait.

261
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,166
But what if Takagi is actually
good at running marathons?

262
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,333
If she is, I'm screwed!

263
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:13,416
[NISHIKATA] I don't have
the time to empty my mind!

264
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,833
Is she already running back?

265
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,375
She's that much
faster than the boys?

266
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,916
I lost my pace, but I caught up.

267
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,083
If you manage to touch me,

268
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,750
then you can be the winner.

269
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,083
[NISHIKATA] I can't touch her
in front of all these people!

270
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,000
Who knows what they'd
think was going on?

271
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,958
Takagi, you sneaky little...

272
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,125
You deliberately
made me lose my pace!

273
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,916
Ugh...

274
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,583
[NISHIKATA]
Takagi.

275
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,708
I'll give you a different
win condition, too.

276
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,500
If you can run 50 meters ahead
of me, the crown is yours!

277
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,708
You mean that?

278
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,750
[NISHIKATA]
Hook, line, and sinker!

279
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,833
I hope you're ready!

280
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,625
Because I'm gonna
destroy your pace this time!

281
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,875
You're finished!

282
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,666
Cool!

283
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,291
I win, then.

284
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,583
All the girls are supposed
to turn back here.

285
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,958
Good luck!

286
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,291
You boys still need
to run two more kilometers.

287
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,500
[NISHIKATA]
Oh, that is so not fair, Takagi!

288
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,541
[TAKAGI] That's why
I asked if you were sure!

289
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,833
We're recording your time
Nishikata; don't stop running!

290
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,708
What'd I say?

291
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,375
Your sides start to hurt
and you get hungry.

292
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,916
As far as I'm concerned,

293
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,458
absolutely nothing positive
comes from running a marathon.

294
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,458
If you used all that energy
to run instead of complaining,

295
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,750
you might be able
to go a little faster.

296
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,208
Why would I do
something so pointless?

297
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:02,166
You really think running is
more pointless than complaining?

298
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,583
I just wanna eat lunch.

299
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,583
[KIMURA]
I'm hungry too.

300
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,541
[MINA]
I'm starving.

301
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,083
[NISHIKATA]
"Ribs."

302
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,166
[NISHIKATA] Takagi messed
with me a ton today.

303
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,750
Again.

304
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,791
Man.

305
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,791
You'll get yours.

306
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:28,833
What's up?

307
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:29,583
Stop staring.

308
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,541
[NISHIKATA laughs]

309
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,583
I can't get over that.

310
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,375
You have such ticklish ribs!

311
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,916
[laughs]

312
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,791
[NISHIKATA] She does this every
time there's an opportunity.

313
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,833
Yeah, sure,
my ribs are ticklish.

314
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,958
But aren't everybody's?

315
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,250
I'm not special.

316
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,666
[gasps]

317
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,041
Hey, Takagi.

318
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,250
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

319
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,750
Wanna make a bet?

320
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,833
I'm thinking whichever one
of us laughs first is the loser.

321
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,416
Yeah, why not?

322
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,416
If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to start right now.

323
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,041
Okay.

324
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,625
[NISHIKATA]
I've got you now!

325
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,291
You have no idea what
I've got in store, do you?

326
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,166
Looks like both your hands
are occupied holding your bike.

327
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:06,958
Too bad.

328
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,666
You're at a disadvantage.

329
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,291
If you think you
can protect your ribs

330
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,625
with only your elbows you've
got another thing coming!

331
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,208
Oh. By the way,

332
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:19,583
so you know, my ribs
happen to not be ticklish.

333
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,583
[TAKAGI]
Made you look!

334
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,375
Wow. No laugh?

335
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,666
[NISHIKATA]
That was too close for comfort.

336
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,791
And did she say
she's not ticklish?

337
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,208
That's a bluff
if I've ever heard one.

338
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,958
She's wide open!

339
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,458
Then could she be
telling the truth?

340
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,375
No.

341
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,500
My best option remaining
is to just go for it

342
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,625
and find out that way.

343
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,416
Is something wrong?

344
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,875
Huh?

345
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,291
All good. It's, uh, nothing.

346
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,875
[NISHIKATA]
This is kinda embarrassing.

347
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,916
Should I really
touch her like that?

348
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,458
Wouldn't it be
sexual harassment?

349
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,458
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

350
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,875
Better hurry up,
or I'll get you again.

351
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,750
Huh?!

352
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,083
[NISHIKATA]
What the heck?

353
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,416
I thought I had the
perfect plan all worked out.

354
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,250
How did I not realize it
had such a pitfall!

355
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,000
It's too risky
to go through with.

356
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,875
I'll keep my distance and
maybe this can end in a draw.

357
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,166
Hey.

358
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,541
[laughs]

359
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,625
That face isn't fair!

360
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,541
I win.

361
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,291
[gasps]

362
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,000
[NISHIKATA] I'm really
dropping the ball today.

363
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,916
I can't believe
I forgot that Takagi makes

364
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,291
such good funny faces.

365
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:07,041
Well then, what should
I make you do this time?

366
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,791
[NISHIKATA] Huh?
There's a penalty for the loser?

367
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,458
You said, "Wanna make a bet."

368
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,166
Of course there is!

369
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,708
Now, let's see...

370
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,208
You can't eat rice
for the rest of your life.

371
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,208
Huh?

372
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,708
[NISHIKATA]
That's brutal!

373
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,041
[TAKAGI]
Don't worry, I'm just kidding.

374
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,666
[TAKAGI] You can't read
<i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

375
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,375
Huh?

376
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,875
[TAKAGI]
That's pretty cruel, too.

377
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,333
Well how about this, then?

378
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,708
You have to poke my ribs.

379
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,375
Uh?

380
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,875
Uhh. Wait, that's my punishment?

381
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,666
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hmm.

382
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,375
Okay, then.

383
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,875
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

384
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,500
[NISHIKATA]
That's it!

385
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,125
I see what's goin' on here!

386
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,708
She wants to enjoy me
getting embarrassed

387
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,916
and struggling to touch her.

388
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,833
Not on my watch!

389
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,333
Come to think of it.

390
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,375
This might actually be the first
time I've ever touched her.

391
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,375
Anywhere but her shoulder,
I mean.

392
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,583
No, don't think about it.

393
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,666
You're just poking her!

394
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,958
It's not a big deal!

395
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,791
You okay?

396
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,500
See?

397
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,666
Told you.

398
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,291
My ribs aren't ticklish
in the slightest.

399
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,625
Yeah.

400
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,000
My armpits are
pretty ticklish, though.

401
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,500
[shrieks]

402
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,333
[NISHIKATA] I definitely
can't touch her there!

403
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,125
[SANAE]
"Regret."

404
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:06,791
[screams]

405
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,291
I totally forgot!

406
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,125
About?

407
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,041
This is absolutely terrible!

408
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,458
What's terrible?

409
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:16,541
We didn't do our test of
courage over the summer--ah...

410
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,208
Oh yeah, I guess we didn't.

411
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,750
Let's do it today after school!

412
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,833
We just gotta!

413
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,416
Uh, I guess that's okay.

414
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,208
[shrieks]

415
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,250
You feel that?
It's so haunted!

416
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,333
Ooooh...

417
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,458
Are we really going in there?

418
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,875
[MINA, SANAE]
Yes!

419
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,000
They're too excited for
this to be a test of courage.

420
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,666
[laughs]

421
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,791
It's so dark!

422
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:49,625
[SANAE]
Uh-huh.

423
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,583
Oh!

424
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,250
A hole!

425
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:55,666
Oooh.

426
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,000
Huh? A paper talisman!

427
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,375
For the spirits!

428
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,958
Yeah.

429
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,041
Look at that!

430
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,125
What's a steel barrel
doing in here?

431
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,375
Uhh?

432
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,333
This isn't scary at all.

433
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,375
What? No.

434
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,958
It's super scary!

435
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,458
Yeah, no.

436
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,333
[MINA]
Whoa, look!

437
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,000
I found a Frisbee!

438
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,000
Lucky!

439
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,791
That's weird to
find this deep in.

440
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,291
It's kinda chilly in here!

441
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,875
You think it's a ghost?

442
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,166
No, we're just out of the sun
and the wind is blowing through.

443
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,583
[MINA screams]
This is so fun!

444
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,375
[SANAE]
Oooo!

445
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,500
[MINA laughs]
Whaddya doing; don't chase me!

446
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,416
Are you happy we did it?

447
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,000
[MINA]
Mm-hmm.

448
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,875
It was such a classic summer
vacation adventure!

449
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,291
Sure, whatever that means.

450
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,958
But it sucks.

451
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:02,333
Summer vacation isn't
coming back any time soon.

452
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,916
[SANAE]
Yeah.

453
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,625
[YUKARI] I'm not used to you
being so bummed out Mina.

454
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,708
Talk about a downer.

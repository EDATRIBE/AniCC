1
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,291
[MINA]
Sanae!

2
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,333
Here! For you.

3
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:44,625
[laughs]

4
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,125
Uh... A love letter?

5
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,500
Of course not!
It's just a regular letter!

6
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,333
Everyone's writing them to
their friends these days!

7
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,750
Haven't you noticed?

8
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:53,791
[SANAE]
No.

9
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,291
[sighs]

10
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,750
Don't you worry, Yukari, I'm
gonna write one for you too.

11
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,291
[YUKARI] That's nice of you,
just don't do it in class.

12
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,791
You need to focus on the lesson.

13
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,875
Friendship is way more
important than any lesson.

14
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,916
What, are the girls all suddenly
into writing letters now?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,458
That's what it looks like.

16
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,958
I wonder if some of them
are writing love letters, too.

17
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,291
[NAKAI laughs]

18
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,708
Maybe. They do
seem really into it.

19
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:16,916
[TAKAO]
I'll say.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,708
[NISHIKATA]
Love letters, huh?

21
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,166
I don't get the appeal.

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,916
They could just say
what they want out loud.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,791
Why bother to write it all down?

24
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,625
Must have a lotta time
on their hands.

25
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,250
[TAKAO yelling]

26
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,166
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

27
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,708
[YUKARI] Sanae, you're
going a little overboard.

28
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,500
[MINA]
One kick was enough.

29
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,500
So kicking him at all's okay?

30
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,708
[TANABE]
All right, let's start class.

31
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,333
Open up your textbooks
to page seventy-six.

32
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,958
[NISHIKATA]
Takagi's writing letters, too?

33
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,708
Sometimes I forget that
she's just your ordinary girl.

34
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:18,666
[NISHIKATA]
What?

35
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,500
[NISHIKATA]
"Letter."

36
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,958
Is there something
wrong, Nishikata?

37
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,333
[NISHIKATA gasps]

38
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,333
No, nothing, everything's great!

39
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,583
[NISHIKATA]
A letter? Who's it from?

40
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,083
And why me?

41
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,916
I wonder if some of them
are writing love letters, too.

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,291
[NISHIKATA] No, no, no,
that's obviously not it!

43
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,166
Someone's playing a prank on me.

44
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,250
Oh, yeah!

45
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,916
This could be Takagi's doing.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,625
No, it's gotta be her!

47
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,625
Takagi--

48
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,708
[NISHIKATA]
Wait a second.

49
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,083
Reign it in, Nishikata!

50
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,583
What if it's somebody else?
What if it isn't Takagi?

51
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,791
If she finds out I got a letter,

52
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,666
she'll just use that
to tease me again!

53
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,166
Yeah? What is it?

54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,583
Uh...

55
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,875
Oh, uh...

56
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,583
I was just thinking.

57
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,041
It's nice out.

58
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,666
Are you hiding something?

59
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,333
Why would I be hiding something?

60
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,666
Hmm...

61
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,625
Dunno. But you're suspicious.

62
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,000
And blushing, too.

63
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,375
You're just imagining things.

64
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,041
[TAKAGI]
Well, maybe.

65
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,291
But why is your textbook closed?

66
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,166
Well. You see, I uh...

67
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,750
I bet it's why your face is red.

68
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,166
No, it's not!
And my face is not red!

69
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,833
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

70
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,375
Yes, that's why I said so!

71
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,083
I guess I was imagining things.

72
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,541
By the way,
that letter in your textbook.

73
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,833
I put that there.

74
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,708
[NISHIKATA yelling]

75
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,958
I knew it!

76
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,791
Yeah. I knew that.

77
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,166
I mean, duh. It was obvious.

78
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,583
[TAKAGI chuckles]
You liar.

79
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,375
What are you talking about?
I'm not lying.

80
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,000
I was just having fun
making you squirm.

81
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,375
So. You gonna read
what's inside?

82
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,208
You wrote something?

83
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,541
Well, it is a letter.

84
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,958
You're just messing with
me like always, aren't you?

85
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,833
[NISHIKATA]
Why aren't you saying something?

86
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,625
Okay.

87
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,916
I'll read it at home later.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,250
Read it now.

89
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,041
What? Why now?

90
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,291
Because. School's over
after this period.

91
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,166
And I wanted an answer by then.

92
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,666
An answer?

93
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,833
[NISHIKATA] If it's a letter
that needs an answer,

94
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,333
then it's a letter
asking a question.

95
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,458
Does that mean it's not just
meant to mess with me?

96
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,916
I wonder if some of them
are writing love letters, too.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
[NISHIKATA]
What if Takao's right?

98
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,958
What if it's a love letter?

99
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,625
Is that even possible?

100
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,416
[NISHIKATA chuckles]

101
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,708
By any chance,

102
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,291
would this happen
to be a love letter, or...?

103
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,416
[birds chirping]

104
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,416
[NISHIKATA]
What's with the silence?!

105
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,750
Why don't you just read it?

106
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,375
Uh, I will, just gimme a minute.

107
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,791
I gotta open it up first.

108
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,166
[NISHIKATA]
Based on that reaction,

109
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,958
I'd wager anything
that this is designed

110
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,333
just to tease me.

111
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,750
Whatever it ends up saying,

112
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,166
I have to be firm and
confident so that she doesn't

113
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,333
get the chance.

114
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,166
Be bold! Be brave!

115
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,750
But what if...

116
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,000
No, it can't be.

117
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,666
Why would it be?

118
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,791
There's no way!

119
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:18,333
But if it is a
love letter, then... I...

120
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,375
You could have just
asked me to my face.

121
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,583
But everyone's writing
letters now. It's cool.

122
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:51,541
However, I was also
curious how you'd react.

123
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,583
So I was right!
You were messing with me!

124
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,000
[TANABE]
Shut it, Nishikata!

125
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,833
[TAKAGI giggling]

126
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,166
[NISHIKATA, TAKAGI]
"First Day of School."

127
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,833
[TEACHER 5A]
Thanks a lot.

128
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,666
I appreciate it, young man.

129
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,583
[NISHIKATA]
Welcome. I gotta go now.

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,416
[TEACHER 5A]
Oh, one second!

131
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,583
What's your name, new kid?

132
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Did I forget to say?

133
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,708
I'm Nishikata.

134
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,333
Nishikata.
Congrats on getting in!

135
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,083
[TEACHER 5A]
Mm-hmm.

136
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,166
[NISHIKATA]
Thanks.

137
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,875
[TANABE] You'll all be learning
alongside each other

138
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,000
over the course
of the next year.

139
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,625
I'm not gonna force you
to get along with everybody.

140
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,250
But I hope you realize
you're only gonna make

141
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,791
the experience
worse if you don't.

142
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,583
Oh, no, did I lose it somewhere?

143
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,708
[TANABE] Well, I don't want to
bore you right off the bat

144
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,333
with a long speech, so...

145
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,333
[TANABE]
Slept in on the first day?

146
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,125
No, I was, uh...

147
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,375
If nothing else,
I admire your audacity.

148
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,958
But... Sir, I--

149
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,125
What's your name?

150
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,250
It's Nishikata.

151
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,625
All right, then. Sit down.

152
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,375
Uh... Yes, sir.

153
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,416
[STUDENTS chattering]

154
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,791
[NISHIKATA]
Oh, great, Everyone's staring.

155
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,916
I have to make friends with
people and clear things up

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,750
before I become known as "that
guy who was late on day one."

157
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,791
[TAKAO, KIMURA laughing]

158
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,250
[door opens]

159
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,125
[TEACHER 12A] Mr. Tanabe,
a moment of your time?

160
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,250
They called and said they're
running a little bit late.

161
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,416
[TANABE]
Really?

162
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,958
Are we pushing the
entrance ceremony back?

163
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,708
[TEACHER 12A]
Yes, I'll keep you posted.

164
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,416
[TANABE] I just got word that
the entrance ceremony

165
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,000
is running behind schedule.

166
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,541
Sounds like it's gonna take a
while before they're all set up.

167
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,125
So in the meantime...

168
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,625
...we're figuring out seating.

169
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,291
At least I'm not in the front.
Sucks to be you.

170
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,791
[NISHIKATA]
Oh, come on.

171
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,458
I'm literally as far in the
corner as I possibly can be.

172
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,458
Normally I'd be happy
about being this far away

173
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,416
from the teacher.

174
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,250
It's the best spot to goof off.

175
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,500
But I don't know
anyone as it is!

176
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,250
There's no one
behind me or to my left.

177
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,208
Worse, I'm sitting
next to a girl.

178
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,875
Did you actually sleep in?

179
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,875
[NISHIKATA]
She's talking to me.

180
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,541
[TAKAGI] It looked like you
were about to say something

181
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,791
to the teacher.

182
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,833
Uh... Yeah.

183
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,000
No. I didn't actually sleep in.

184
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,916
[NISHIKATA] If only I'd
made it here earlier.

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,291
I was at the school
on time, but...

186
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,916
It's Takagi's fault.

187
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,333
Whoever that is.

188
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,666
[TAKAGI]
Huh?

189
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,791
[TANABE] All right everyone,
head to the gym.

190
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,083
Let's keep quiet.

191
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,041
And no running

192
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,750
[STUDENTS]
Okay.

193
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,583
[STUDENT 10A]
Hey!

194
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,375
You want to walk
there together?

195
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,500
[TAKAGI]
Sure.

196
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,333
[TAKAGI]
Wait a second.

197
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,833
[PRINCIPAL 12A] You will
soon be given a great gift,

the right to vote.

199
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,375
With it, you will choose
students for positions

200
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,875
of responsibility.

201
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,416
It's important you select
politicians who are worthy

202
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,458
of your trust and confidence.

203
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,791
Similarly, your mothers
and fathers choose

204
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,666
their representatives
by voting...

205
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,208
Wasn't that speech crazy long?

206
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,333
[TAKAO] That dude was talking
so long I almost fell asleep!

207
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,375
I know, it was like when we
started elementary school.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,583
You're pretty cool for comin'
in late on the first day.

209
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,958
[NISHIKATA]
I didn't mean to.

210
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,333
[TANABE] Everybody quit yappin'
and take your seats.

211
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,875
I'm sorry for getting
back late, sir.

212
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,041
[TANABE]
Just go sit down.

213
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,958
That's it for today,
but remember,

214
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,416
real classes start tomorrow.

215
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,791
Don't mess around because
I'm letting you out early.

216
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,083
Go straight home.

217
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,625
Hey, Nishikata.

218
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,333
How 'bout I try to guess
why you were late today?

219
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,625
I bet I can.

220
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:28,083
If I get it right
on my first try, I win.

221
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,541
Sure, I guess.

222
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,000
[NISHIKATA] Wait, how
is she gonna figure it out

223
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,458
on her first try?

224
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,041
You were delivering a lost item.

225
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,333
What? How'd you know?

226
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,375
[TANABE]
Hey. Quiet down, Nishikata.

227
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,625
I'm sorry, sir.

228
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,125
How did you know?

229
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,208
[TAKAGI giggles]

230
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,458
How indeed.

231
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,208
Uh... Wait.

232
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,166
You're Takagi?

233
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,291
You weren't here yet when
everyone introduced themselves.

[TAKAGI laughing]

236
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,541
What's with that reaction?

237
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,125
Hey! I just said to be quiet!

238
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,333
[TAKAGI, NISHIKATA]
Sorry!

239
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,708
[TAKAGI laughing]

240
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,916
Thanks a lot. For picking it up.

241
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,416
It's nice to meet you.

242
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,333
It's nice to meet you, too.

Seventy-four! Seventy-five!

She's not here yet.

00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,791
Morning, Nishikata.

253
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,833
Oh, good morning
yourself, Takagi!

254
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,708
So, hey. Have you heard?

255
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,291
They're going to be changing
where everyone sits today.

256
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,708
Really? When?

257
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,208
During homeroom.

258
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,375
[NISHIKATA]
Homeroom? That's first period!

--Are you okay?

260
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,208
First period, huh?

261
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,416
That'll be kinda fun.

262
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,458
Yeah?

263
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,583
Well, I mean, we haven't had a
seating change in a while, so...

264
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,416
Yeah, sure.

265
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,208
I guess there are
always positives.

266
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,875
But if I'm being honest.

267
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,250
I wanted to be next to you
for a while longer.

268
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,041
[NISHIKATA] She's just
messing with me again.

269
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,541
I almost fell for it.

Does anyone still
need a number? No?

Then move your desks
according to the layout

273

on the board.

274
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,375
What number did you draw?

275
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,666
Twenty-nine.

Oh. The far back again, then.

me answers on all our tests!

That's too bad.
I was hoping we'd be closer.

Yeah, me too.

getting really bad lately.

what's on the board.

00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,416
Yeah. I'm just great.

It's nothing.
Feel free to just ignore me.

I'm just depressed because
I'm not sitting near Nakai.

306
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,041
I was really hoping we'd
be next to each other.

Anyone!
Please switch seats with me!

How am I supposed to
sneak an early lunch

313
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,166
if I'm right in front
of the teacher?

314
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,625
You aren't switching
seats unless you have

315
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,166
a legitimate reason.

316
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,583
Also, Kimura.

00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,708
Please, do see me after class.

318
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,708
[NISHIKATA]
Right in front of the teacher?

319
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,291
But if I'm being honest.

320
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,625
I wanted to be next to
you for a while longer.

321
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,541
Hey, Kimura, listen!

322
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,541
I can't see the board
from here; let's switch!

323
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,750
Oh. Thanks!

324
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,541
But I already found someone.

325
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,958
[NISHIKATA]
It's not like I care.

326
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,458
[TAKAGI]
Nishikata. Hey.

327
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,958
[NISHIKATA]
What the--?

328
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,041
Guess what?
I'm sitting here now.

329
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,125
Wha--? But how?

330
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,375
Well, first Nakai
and Kimura switched.

331
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,875
Because Nakai couldn't see
the board well enough.

332
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,041
So Nakai was all
the way up front.

333
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,333
When she saw that,
Mano wanted to switch with me,

334
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,333
since I was right next to him.

335
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,875
Mano's short, so she
prefers the front anyway.

336
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,791
[NISHIKATA]
Oh. I see.

337
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,666
Nishikata.

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,166
You tried to sit next to
me up there, didn't you?

339
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,208
No, I...

340
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,208
I couldn't see the
board well from here.

341
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,916
Hmm?

342
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,041
Oh, yeah?

343
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,541
Mmm?

344
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,958
What? It's true!

345
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,750
All right, we're starting class.

346
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,041
Get your textbooks out.

347
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,625
Oh. That reminds me.

348
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,833
What was it that you
wanted to say earlier today?

349
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,208
What, did I read you wrong?

350
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,166
I thought you were
looking for an opportunity.

351
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,000
[NISHIKATA]
Sorry.

352
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,541
It took me a while
to return this.

353
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,625
Thank you.

354
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,333
From over summer break?

355
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,916
Uh... Yeah.

356
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,666
From then, and...

357
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,291
The first day of school?

358
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,750
You remembered that?

359
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,791
Of course I did.
You did too.

360
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,916
Heh! Thank you.

361
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,541
I made sure to wash it for you.

362
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,416
Oh, nothing.

363
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,875
I'm just kinda glad.

364
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,000
--Why?
--Oh. Y'know...

365
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,416
For a lot.

366
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,791
That I got to return
your handkerchief.

367
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,291
And that we ended up
next to each other again, oh!

368
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,625
And also...

369
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,000
Well, yeah.

370
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,791
I'm looking forward to this.

371
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,291
[TANABE] So here, we'd say,
"I do not agree."

372
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,000
Or you could contract it
to, "I don't agree."

373
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,500
That part's pretty easy.

374
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,750
But on the next page, things get
a little more complicated.

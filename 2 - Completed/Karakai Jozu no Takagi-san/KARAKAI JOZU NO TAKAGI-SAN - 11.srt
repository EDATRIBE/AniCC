00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,583
[NISHIKATA]
How to approach a cat.

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:14,875
Step one:
Don't make eye contact.

3
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,125
Step two:
Assume a crouching posture.

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,458
That do anything for ya?

5
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:26,291
You can tell by my body language
that I'm not a threat, right?

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:30,375
Step three:
Approach ever so slowly.

7
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,583
[NISHIKATA]
This is incredible!

8
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,875
I guess that guy
on TV wasn't kidding!

9
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,708
His advice is
just what I needed.

10
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,291
Oh, hey! Nishikata!

11
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,500
[NISHIKATA yells]

12
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,666
[NISHIKATA sighs]

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,916
[TAKAGI]
What were you doing?

14
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,625
[NISHIKATA]
Nothing.

15
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,833
[MEETA meows]

16
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:29,916
[NISHIKATA]
"Cat."

17
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,375
[NISHIKATA growls]
Curse you, Takagi!

18
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,916
I was this close to petting
that cat when you came along!

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,208
But...

20
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,916
On the other hand,
I'm glad she didn't actually

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,125
see me petting it.

22
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,500
Because if she did...

23
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,541
[TAKAGI]
Ooh, Nishikata's petting a cat!

24
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,708
I thought boys weren't
supposed to like cute things.

25
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,625
[NISHIKATA]
She'd never let me live it down!

26
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,041
[TAKAGI laughing]

27
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,000
[NISHIKATA] And there's no way
I'm gonna give her more ammo

28
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,250
to tease me with!

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,708
Look, a cat.

30
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,750
Really?

31
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,875
Oh, wow. You like cats?

32
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,625
Not especially.

33
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,583
[NISHIKATA]
Crap! That was close.

34
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,416
[TAKAGI]
Here, kitty, kitty.

35
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,500
Over here.

36
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,833
[NISHIKATA chuckles]

37
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,875
So naïve, Takagi.

38
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,083
Cats are very wary creatures.

39
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,375
There's no way one
would just waltz right--

40
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,625
--[TAKAGI] Come here.
--[NISHIKATA] Wh-What?!

41
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,458
Why? That wasn't
even a proper call!

42
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,625
Unless...

43
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,041
What is she,
some sort of cat whisperer?

44
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,375
That's a good boy.

45
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,375
You're looking cuter
than usual, Meeta.

46
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,041
Wait, you know this cat?

47
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,166
Yep. He belongs to
the old lady who lives

48
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,833
around the corner from us.

49
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,666
[NISHIKATA]
No wonder! That explains it.

50
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,791
Aww. So soft.

51
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,500
[TAKAGI giggles]

52
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,208
He's great.
And he really likes people.

53
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,000
He'll let you pet
him all you want.

54
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,333
[NISHIKATA]
Could it really be?

55
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,791
The coveted all-you-can-pet cat?

56
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,458
I need him!

57
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,625
Why don't you play
with him a little?

58
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,250
What? Why would I?

59
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,333
Come on.

60
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,083
You were trying
to pet the other cat.

61
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,541
You used that trick that
was on TV yesterday.

62
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,625
I think you wanna.

63
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,416
[NISHIKATA]
She already knows!

64
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,625
[NISHIKATA] I just thought
that guy on TV didn't know

65
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,500
what he was talking about, so...

66
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,791
So... You don't particularly
like cats or anything?

67
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,500
No. Not really.

68
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,541
And I've definitely never
wanted to pet a cat or anything.

69
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,250
Really? That's surprising.

70
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,208
They're just so cute.

71
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,041
Their coats are all fluffy.

72
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,125
And their paws are so squishy.

73
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,333
[NISHIKATA]
Are you kidding me?

74
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,625
This cat even lets
people touch his paws?

75
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,583
I wanna touch!

76
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,625
But I can't!

77
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,458
I've dug myself
too deep for that!

78
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,208
I know!

79
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,708
I really don't get why people
are always going on and on

80
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,208
about petting cats.

81
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,708
It's not like they're
really that cute.

82
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,333
And even if they were,
I wouldn't want to touch them.

83
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,541
When it comes down to it,
they're animals.

84
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,458
You can never be
sure what they'll do.

85
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,541
You're taking a risk
every time you approach one.

86
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,250
I see what's going on.

87
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,625
You're saying that
because you're afraid

88
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,833
of getting scratched.

89
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,250
[NISHIKATA]
She took the bait!

90
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,125
Of course I'm not afraid!

91
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,625
But... If you
don't believe me,

92
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,291
I'll just have to prove it
right now by petting this cat!

93
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,291
That's okay.

94
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,375
I actually believe you now.

95
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,708
Sorry I doubted you.

96
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,166
[TAKAGI laughing]

97
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,291
Your face is like an
open book, Nishikata!

98
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,500
You really want
to pet this cat, huh?

99
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,500
[laughing]

100
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,958
[NISHIKATA]
Takagi!

101
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,291
What'll it be?

102
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,833
You gonna pet him?
Or leave him hanging?

103
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,666
I want to pet him.

104
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,875
Is that okay?

105
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,250
Mm-hmm.

106
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,083
Though I think Meeta
has different plans.

107
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,750
What do you mean?!
He disappeared?!

108
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,166
[TAKAGI]
Yeah.

109
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,666
Do you want to go look
for a different cat to pet?

110
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,250
[NISHIKATA]
We're gonna be late for school.

111
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,916
[MANO] So I asked, and
Satou said she likes Tanaka

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,041
from Class 3.

113
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,333
[STUDENT 11A]
Oh, I called it.

114
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,583
Didn't I call it?

115
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,833
[YUKARI]
I can't take it anymore!

116
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,541
I want to talk about love!

117
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,833
[MINA]
"Taste."

118
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,416
[YUKARI] So I've been
doing some thinking.

119
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,000
And I was wondering,
what's like your type?

120
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,750
[YUKARI]
Was that too abrupt?

121
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,166
I never expected you to ask.

122
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,833
I happen to like
the dependent type.

123
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,583
As for me, I prefer a well-built
physique and long hair.

124
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,625
Oh, yeah?

125
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,041
I never would have guessed.

126
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,416
[YUKARI]
It's happening!

127
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,333
They're ready to talk
about love too!

128
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,750
It's funny.

129
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,333
You just caught us in the
middle of discussing that.

130
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,583
Did I really?
What a coincidence.

131
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,208
[YUKARI]
They've both grown so much!

132
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,291
All right.
I'm gonna dig deeper here.

133
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,000
[MINA]
What's your type, Yukari?

134
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,458
[YUKARI]
I'm so glad you asked!

135
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,750
Well, if I had to choose,
I'd say long legs

136
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,666
and handsome features are nice.

137
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,083
What about hair?

138
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,083
[YUKARI] She's really
particular about a guy's hair.

139
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,791
I tend to like longer
hair too, like you do.

140
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,500
[YUKARI]
Ah! This is fun!

141
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,166
I've wanted to have a
conversation like this

142
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,583
with friends forever!

143
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,166
[MINA]
So then a borzoi, yeah?

144
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,375
Uh-huh. A borzo--Eh?

145
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,250
I'm sorry, what are
you talking about?

146
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,250
Dogs, duh.
What are you talking about?

147
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,250
Which breed is your favorite?

148
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,166
I don't know, Chihuahuas?

149
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,250
What? But they don't fit
into your description at all!

150
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,875
[SANAE] Well, there are
some long-haired Chihuahuas

151
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,041
out there.

152
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,625
[NISHIKATA]
"Portrait."

153
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,750
You gonna draw?

154
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,625
[NISHIKATA]
Hm?

155
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,083
You're going to run out of time.

156
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,125
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah.

157
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,291
[NISHIKATA growls]

158
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,000
Why does it have
to be a portrait?

159
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,750
Can't we just draw
whatever we want?

160
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,083
I'm your reference.
You have to actually look at me.

161
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,375
I am looking.

162
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,833
[ART TEACHER 11A]
Everyone?

163
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,625
Remember to
observe your subject.

164
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,125
Don't get too focused on drawing

165
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,041
or this'll take longer
than necessary.

166
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,625
You need to strike a balance.

167
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,958
Take twice as much time
studying your reference

168
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,250
as you do drawing them.

169
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,541
[TAKAGI]
You heard her.

170
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah, I did.

171
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,041
[TAKAGI chuckles]

172
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,291
Why are you laughing?

173
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,500
Oh... Oh, sorry. It's nothing.

174
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,875
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah, right.

175
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,666
What was that all about?

176
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,375
Is there something on my face?

177
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,375
No, there wasn't anything
there when I checked

178
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,333
in the bathroom mirror
during the break.

179
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,458
What, then? Bed head?

180
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,458
No, I checked my hair, too.

181
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,000
Is she just laughing
at my face itself?

182
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,250
I can't do anything about that!

183
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,708
Calm down, calm down!

184
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,666
I know.

185
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,583
It's just her usual game.

186
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,875
There's nothing wrong--
she's just making me worry

187
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,833
so she can enjoy my reaction.

188
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,291
Well two can play at that game.

189
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:25,458
[NISHIKATA chuckling]

190
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,333
Are you laughing at how
bad your drawing is?

191
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,916
I am not!

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,583
Then is there something on my
face that's making you laugh?

193
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,791
[NISHIKATA]
Ugh!

194
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,958
I didn't expect her
to just ask me flat out.

195
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,416
No, there isn't.

196
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,166
[TAKAGI]
Hm?

197
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,458
[NISHIKATA]
Oh, good, she backed down.

198
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,000
[YUKARI] Mina, I told you
a hundred times!

199
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,583
My eyes don't slant that much,
you're exaggerating.

200
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,166
But that's how I envision you,
so that's how I drew it.

201
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,333
Don't draw what you see
in your mind, draw me!

202
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,500
[NISHIKATA]
That's it!

203
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,875
[TAKAGI gasps]
This is supposed to be me?

204
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,875
[NISHIKATA] Well, yeah,
that's how I envision you.

205
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,375
I can't help it.

206
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,666
[NISHIKATA]
That'll teach her.

207
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,750
Okay. Only ten minutes left.

208
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,791
[NISHIKATA]
Oh, this is gonna be good.

209
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,291
[TAKAGI]
Hey, Nishikata.

210
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,583
Mind if I take a look?

211
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,333
Nope. Go ahead.

212
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,291
[NISHIKATA laughs]
How do you like that?

213
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,708
[NISHIKATA]
Oh, no.

214
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,083
Did I take it too far?

215
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,416
I just drew that based
on how I envision you, so...

216
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,708
[TAKAGI]
Nishikata.

217
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,541
[NISHIKATA gasps]

218
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,125
[laughing]

219
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,958
That face is too much, Takagi!

220
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,666
[laughing]

221
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,583
My stomach hurts already!

222
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,750
If you're gonna draw me weird,
you should draw that face.

223
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:03,416
Try again. You can do it. Here.

224
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,625
Okay.

225
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,208
If you can't see me well,
I can get closer.

226
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,958
Uh, no, no,
that's fine, you're good.

227
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,083
'Kay.

228
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,125
[NISHIKATA] When I get a good
look at her, Takagi is kinda...

229
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,166
Pre-- Pret--

230
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,083
Pretty--

231
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,875
There. Finished. You see?

232
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,708
So?

233
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,416
Was I really looking
sideways that much?

234
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh! Forgot something.

235
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,375
Now it's done.

236
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,416
Why'd you add red?
It's not like I'm blushing!

237
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,833
Uh, you have been
this whole time.

238
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:58,875
No, I haven't!

239
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,208
It just looks like that.
I swear!

240
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,458
Look closely, I'm not!

241
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,250
[NISHIKATA]
"Fortune Telling."

242
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,208
[STUDENT 10A]
Oh, not bad.

243
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,750
This card means your wish
will more or less come true.

244
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,166
Really? Is that so?

245
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,166
You should totally get your
love fortune told too, Mina.

246
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,416
She's good at this.

247
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,666
See? Go for it!

248
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,583
Huh? You say you want me
to get my fortune told,

249
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,625
but I know you really just
want to get yours done.

250
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,083
What do you mean?
You don't know that!

251
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,250
It's obvious.

252
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,166
No, I just wanted Mina to do it!

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,375
This really sucks.

254
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,458
I just wanted to go home today.

255
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,500
[TAKAGI]
Nishikata.

256
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,666
What do you want?

257
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,750
Rock-paper-scissors.
You up for a match?

258
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,166
What? Why now?

259
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,708
The loser has to buy the
winner juice on the way home.

260
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,250
Sound good?

261
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,958
Sorry, but I just found out
I have to clean the classroom

262
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,166
after school,
so go home without me.

263
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,333
No problem, I'll just
wait here for you.

264
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,208
But I don't want to
make you sit around.

265
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,875
Okay.

266
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,625
How about if you win,
I have to help you clean up?

267
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,583
Why do you wanna play
rock-paper-scissors so bad?

268
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,333
I'm just in the mood for it.

269
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,083
All right, I guess it's okay.

270
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,583
Under one condition!

271
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,708
Which is...?

272
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,666
No psychological attacks
like telling me

273
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,833
what you're about
to choose, okay?

274
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,750
Sure. Fine with me.

275
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,375
[NISHIKATA]
That was close.

276
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,500
I don't need a repeat
of that day I lost to her

277
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,041
four times in a row
because of those tricks.

278
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,250
Now let's do it.

279
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,000
[BOTH]
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

280
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,541
[NISHIKATA]
I-I won?

281
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,500
This is my first ever
victory over Takagi!

282
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:43,083
Yes! I finally did it!
I bet she's super mad!

283
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,666
Well... Guess I'm helping.

284
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,916
[NISHIKATA]
She doesn't seem to mind.

285
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,208
Whatever, I don't care.
I still won!

286
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,791
I gotta celebrate while
I have the chance.

287
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,125
Nishikata?

288
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,875
[NISHIKATA]
What is it, Takagi?

289
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,541
Do you believe in
fortune telling?

290
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,291
Uh, fortunes? Not really.

291
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,541
Why do you ask?

292
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,458
The girls and I
had ours told today.

293
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,708
[NISHIKATA]
Oh.

294
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,083
Is that what that deck
of cards was earlier?

295
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,458
They're called tarot cards.

296
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,958
Actually, today my tarot
reading was about love.

297
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh.

298
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,541
[NISHIKATA]
Love?

299
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,541
[TAKAGI]
Turned out good.

300
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,833
It said I'll do well with
my current crush.

301
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,541
Your current crush?

302
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,416
Good for you, then.

303
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,375
What about you?

304
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,541
Do you have a crush?

305
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,083
Huh? What was that?

306
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,333
I said, "Do you have a crush?"

307
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,875
Nope! I don't! Definitely not!

308
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,583
[TAKAGI]
I see.

309
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,458
[NISHIKATA] Why did she
ask me that just now?

310
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,708
Could it be?

311
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,625
Does Takagi... like me?

312
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,291
What's wrong?

313
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,083
It's nothing! Don't worry
about it, everything's cool!

314
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,791
[NISHIKATA]
Why do I feel so nervous?

315
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,083
Unless... I...

316
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,458
Do I like Takagi?

317
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,708
No, that's just ridiculous.

318
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,291
Oh, by the way, Nishikata.

319
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,958
Yeah? What's up?

320
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,666
The reason I asked
if you had a crush

321
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,625
was because I had your
tarot reading done, too.

322
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,625
[NISHIKATA]
So that's why you asked me that.

323
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,791
Makes sense I guess.

324
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,000
[NISHIKATA]
Should have known.

325
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,833
Wait. Am I disappointed?

326
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,375
Yeah. And guess what?

327
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,166
You'll do well with
your crush, too.

328
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,333
That'd be great.
If you had a crush.

329
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,958
[TAKAGI]
You're blushing.

330
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,000
[NISHIKATA] That's because
I'm hard at work cleaning.

331
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,500
[NISHIKATA]
Just change the subject.

332
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,791
So what other readings
did you have done?

333
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,791
I asked what you'd pick if we
played rock-paper-scissors.

334
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,833
[NISHIKATA] Huh?
As in the match I won earlier?

335
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,083
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hmm.

336
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,958
[NISHIKATA]
Clearly that didn't work out.

337
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,958
It's just a fortune,
not destiny.

338
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,833
I feel stupid for worrying.

339
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,583
Maybe if you didn't believe
in something as silly

340
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,833
as fortune telling,
you wouldn't be stuck here,

341
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,041
doing half my work!

342
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,958
It came true, though.

343
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,500
Huh? What do you mean?
I won that match, didn't I?

344
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,416
Yup. You sure did.

345
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,291
[TAKAGI]
Come on.

346
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,791
Let's get back to
cleaning this place up.

347
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,916
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah.

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,250
Wait, what?

349
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,375
[NISHIKATA]
"Critical."

350
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,833
[NISHIKATA chuckles]

351
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,416
Today's the day.

352
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,083
I'm gonna beat Takagi.

353
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,166
Count on it!

354
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,583
Oh. Hey, Nishikata.
Good morning.

355
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,333
Back atcha. Morning.

356
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,666
Somebody's in a good mood today.

357
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,541
[NISHIKATA]
Really? You think so?

358
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,416
[NISHIKATA]
I'm in a great mood.

359
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,000
[NISHIKATA] You have no idea
what's coming your way.

360
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,000
It just so happens that
I'm invincible today.

361
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,583
Because according to
my horoscope this morning,

362
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,958
I am number--!

363
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,916
Is it your horoscope?
Cancer was number one today.

364
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,250
Huh?!

365
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,416
Hold on a second,
how do you know I'm a cancer?

366
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,791
I mean, I said happy birthday
to you this year, so...

367
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,166
Oh. I forgot.
I guess that makes sense.

368
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,375
[NISHIKATA] What, does she read
everyone's horoscope every day?

369
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,916
She's crafty.

370
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,916
But she underestimates me.

371
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,708
I bet she doesn't know
that in today's blood-type

372
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,041
fortune, I'm also--!

373
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,666
Also, blood type O's
number one, too.

374
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,916
Huh?!

375
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,875
Okay, how do you know
that I'm blood type O?

376
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,583
I had a feeling that you were.

377
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,750
Just a guess.

378
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,333
[NISHIKATA]
She's just too good.

379
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,916
I was the one
underestimating her.

380
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,250
You just can't
mess with this girl.

381
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,083
But just you wait.

382
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,708
Today I'm invinc--!

383
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,791
Feeling invincible today,
aren't you?

384
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,291
Because of what you heard
about both of your fortunes?

385
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,541
[TAKAGI]
Ah.

386
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,958
[NISHIKATA growls]
Are you freakin' kidding me?

387
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,250
Well then.
I hope something good happens.

388
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,708
Yeah, that'd be cool.

389
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,333
[NISHIKATA] I don't care if you
basically read my mind!

390
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,208
I'm lucky as can be today!
I'll get you!

391
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:35,083
[school bell rings]

392
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,791
[NISHIKATA]
Teased fifty times.

393
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,625
Which means I have to do a
hundred and fifty push-ups.

394
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,916
Why? This sucks!

395
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,958
Was it stupid of me
to get excited just because

396
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,666
I'm supposed to
have good fortune?

397
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,208
[NISHIKATA]
Ugh...

398
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,541
What's wrong?

399
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,208
Are you upset because
nothing special happened?

400
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,916
It's just a silly fortune.

401
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,458
You seemed to believe
that tarot reading

402
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,666
you had the other day!

403
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,291
[NISHIKATA] Man, I've spent all
day trying to think of a plan

404
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,166
to beat Takagi,
but I couldn't come up

405
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,833
with anything worthwhile.

406
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,041
Maybe I should just
call it quits for now.

407
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,291
Either my fortune's wrong,
or my luck is that

408
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,083
I only got teased
fifty times today.

409
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,333
Hey, Nishikata.

410
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,375
Let's walk home together.

411
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,458
Oh. Yeah, sure, why not?

412
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,041
[NISHIKATA] No, I can't
let it end like this!

413
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,458
[TAKAGI]
By the way,

414
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,416
what exactly did your
fortune say this morning?

415
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,000
Say what? You mean...

416
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,166
That short description
they write with your rank?

417
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,958
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hmm.

418
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,166
Uh, let's see.

419
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,750
Something like...

420
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,333
[TV VOICE]
Cancer is in first place.

421
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,500
You'll land a critical hit!
Get 'em!

422
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,000
[NISHIKATA]
That's right! A critical hit!

423
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,875
Which means I can turn the
tables with a single blow!

424
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,458
It all makes sense now!

425
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,458
No matter how many times
she teases me today,

426
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,833
if I can get back
at her just once, I win!

427
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,666
Never give up hope!

428
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,958
So? "Something like" what?

429
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,458
Uh... I can't seem to
remember what it was.

430
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,916
[SAKURAI]
Hey, Nishikata!

431
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,291
That game Fierce Soccer's
on sale today!

432
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,041
We're playin' at
his house. You in?

433
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,875
[NISHIKATA]
Fierce Soccer, huh?

434
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:21,125
I did want to play that.

435
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:25,583
But I can't go home without
scoring my critical hit!

436
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,375
Then again, I haven't
exactly come up

437
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,791
with any sort of plan yet.

438
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,750
No, I should still
be able to do it.

439
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,458
I'm the luckiest man
on earth today!

440
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,125
I can do anything!

441
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,000
You regret it?

442
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,333
Turning 'em down?

443
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,958
Oh, that. Nah.

444
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,750
I wanted to walk home
with you, anyway.

445
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,583
[NISHIKATA] Hmm.
There's gotta be something.

446
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,125
Hold on!

447
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,083
I didn't just say something
super awkward, did I?

448
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,875
Uh... I remembered my
fortune which said I'd land

449
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,583
a critical hit today, so...

450
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,291
I thought today was
gonna be my best chance

451
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,625
to beat you at something!

452
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,750
So what I just said wasn't
what it sounded like!

453
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,791
[groans]

454
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,458
[NISHIKATA]
This is the worst!

455
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,416
I didn't land a critical hit!

456
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,333
I scored on my own goal!

457
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,750
So uh... Do me a solid.

458
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,458
Could'ya pretend
you didn't hear that?

459
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,750
[TAKAGI giggles]

460
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,625
I guess I can do that.

461
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,750
I'll pretend I heard nothing.

462
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,166
If you say it one more time.
[giggles]

463
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,375
I am not gonna say it again!

464
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,041
Forget you, I'm going this way!

465
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,500
I'll see you around!

466
00:21:58,666 --> 00:21:59,916
[TAKAGI]
A critical hit.

467
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,958
How terrifying.

1
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,500
[NISHIKATA]
The day has come.

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,250
I've waited so long!

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,541
[chuckles]

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:19,208
And finally,
I got my first cell phone!

5
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,916
[NISHIKATA]
"Cell Phone."

6
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,250
[NISHIKATA]
And contact added.

7
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,416
Thanks, man.

8
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,250
Sure thing.

9
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,625
[TAKAGI]
You got a cell phone?

10
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,250
[NISHIKATA]
Right on cue!

11
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,375
[TAKAGI] Oh cool,
you got the latest model?

12
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,791
I was thinking of upgrading
to that one, myself.

13
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,333
Do you mind
if I take a look at it?

14
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,666
Not at all.

15
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,166
Wow. It's lighter than mine.

16
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,833
[NISHIKATA]
I've been waiting for this!

17
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,541
With a cell phone, I can tease
her in all sorts of new ways!

18
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,666
Of course, I've got
one plan in mind already.

19
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,125
You're goin' down, Takagi.

20
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,083
Ooo.

21
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,375
That's a cool feature.

22
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,625
Thanks for letting me
check it out.

23
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,166
No prob.

24
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,041
Uhh...

25
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,041
Huh?

26
00:02:50,125 --> 00:03:04,458
[NISHIKATA]
Ah, it's nothing.

27
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,833
[NISHIKATA] I thought
Takagi was gonna ask me

28
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,208
for my email for sure.

29
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,083
What now?

30
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,041
[TAKAGI]
Something wrong?

31
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,208
Huh? Nope!

32
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,208
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

33
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,750
[NISHIKATA]
Man.

34
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,916
If I can't get in touch with
her, I can't execute my plan!

35
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,500
[NISHIKATA] Wait a second,
why don't I just ask her then?

36
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,875
Why didn't I think
of that earlier?

37
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,208
It's so obvious!

38
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,333
Hey, Takagi?

39
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,208
[TAKAGI]
What is it?

40
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,208
[NISHIKATA]
I, uh...

41
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,625
Uh...

42
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,458
Your email address?

43
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,333
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

44
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,583
Never mind, wasn't important!

45
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,291
[NISHIKATA]
What's going on?

46
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,500
Why am I so nervous
all of a sudden?

47
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,958
Get it together!

48
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,458
I'm just trying to get
Takagi's email address!

49
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,750
[gasps]

50
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,958
I didn't really
think about it before.

51
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,750
But if I'm asking
a girl for her email.

52
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,750
Isn't that kinda like...?

53
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,541
[NISHIKATA]
Yes, it is!

54
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,583
[TAKAGI]
Hey, Nishikata.

55
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,166
There isn't something you
want to ask me, is there?

56
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,083
No, not at all!

57
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,958
Nope! Not a thing! Really!

58
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,666
[TAKAGI]
Hmm...

59
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,916
Funny.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,083
I was certain you wanted
to ask me for my email.

61
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,583
[NISHIKATA]
She knows!

62
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,833
Wait!

63
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,416
This might be my chance!

64
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,541
All I gotta do is say,
"Actually, you're right,"

65
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,916
and I'll get exactly
what I want!

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,916
You've grown too careless.

67
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:40,916
Uh.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,375
Actually, yeah, you're right.

69
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,416
I am? Then why'd
you lie about it?

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,416
Are you embarrassed?

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,875
Or what?

72
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,250
Huh?

73
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,291
[NISHIKATA] She found a
way to flip this one on me.

74
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,083
Uh. Who, me?

75
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,541
Embarrassed? No way.

76
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,333
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

77
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,208
I think you are.

78
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,791
[NISHIKATA] It's just good to
have in case something happens.

79
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,250
[TAKAGI]
If what happens?

80
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,666
[NISHIKATA]
I dunno something.

81
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,916
So who else did you ask?

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm not the only one, am I?

83
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,583
Nah.

84
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,041
So far Kimura and Takao.

85
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,291
And Nakai.

86
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,208
That's all?

87
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,125
It's only been a day.

88
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,958
[NISHIKATA] Yeah, yeah, I'm sure
you've figured it out by now.

89
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,041
You're the first girl
I've asked, whatever!

90
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,250
Just hurry up and give it
already, this is killing me!

91
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,000
So what?

92
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,458
Do you want to message me?

93
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,541
Of course not!

94
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,041
I just want your
stupid contact info,

95
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,000
so I can tease you
when we're not at school!

96
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,250
It has nothing to do with
wanting to talk to you!

97
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,000
Seriously!

98
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,833
That's all!

99
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,041
It's nothing weird, I swear!

100
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:51,791
[laughs]

101
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,625
I knew it had to be
something like that.

102
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,791
[TAKAGI]
Well, your plan to tease me

103
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,833
has been thoroughly crushed.

104
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,625
Do you still want my email?

105
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,583
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah.

106
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,166
[TAKAGI]
To make up for teasing me.

107
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,166
Help me clean up next week
when I'm on day duty.

108
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,875
[NISHIKATA]
I didn't tease you, though!

109
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,291
I was going to tease you!

110
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,708
Well, yeah.

111
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,625
But if I hadn't found out,
you would have eventually.

112
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,375
[NISHIKATA]
Y-Yeah.

113
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,375
Then it's a deal.

114
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,458
I'll talk to you soon.

115
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,041
When I get home.

116
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,958
She'll talk to me
when she gets home?

117
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,125
[NISHIKATA] Does that mean
she's gonna tease me

118
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,333
when I'm at home too?

119
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,541
I wish I had a cell phone.

120
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,125
[MINA] But I asked my mom
if I could get one yesterday

121
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,208
and she said I was
too young to have a phone.

122
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,875
Of course, she'll say no when
you ask her out of the blue.

123
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,833
You do say things
out of the blue a lot.

124
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,750
[MINA]
Hey, that's not true!

125
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,625
For your information,
I've wanted one forevs.

126
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,125
How long is "forevs"?

127
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,875
[MINA]
Umm...

128
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,541
If I had to put it into words,

129
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,541
a week?

130
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,916
So in not-Mina time, it's
been three days, give or take?

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,250
Either way, that's
still way too sudden.

132
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,875
[boys laugh]

133
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,041
Dude what's up
with that picture?

134
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:31,958
It's ridiculous!

135
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:32,625
So dumb!

136
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,708
It's Super Ponpoko!

137
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,166
Pon, pon, po-pon, pon!
Pon, pon, po-pon, pon!

138
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,833
But there's no denying a lot of
kids have them these days.

139
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,458
I guess I kinda want one, too.

140
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,625
I know, right?

141
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,416
I wish we all had 'em!

142
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,541
We should totally all bug our
moms till they buy 'em for us!

143
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,750
You want one too, right, Sanae?

144
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,500
No. Not really.

145
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,250
What?

146
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,458
Why the heck not?

147
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,500
We could message
each other and stuff!

148
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,583
Because, hold on,

149
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,041
I have one.

150
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,083
What? How did that happen?

151
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,083
Sometimes I get home
late from my club,

152
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,083
so my parents
wanted me to have it.

153
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,958
[YUKARI]
That makes sense.

154
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,625
Still, you should have
told us when you got it.

155
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,208
[MINA]
I know!

156
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,208
If I tell my parents
Sanae has one,

157
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,875
maybe they'll buy one for me!

158
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,958
Hey. That's not a bad idea.

159
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,166
I'll do the same thing.

160
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,250
[MINA] This time
my mom'll agree for sure!

161
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,125
Then I can get
a group chat going!

162
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,041
And I can download tons
of games and play them

163
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,125
until I fall asleep!

164
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,833
[SANAE]
Group chats are the worst

165
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,083
[YUKARI]
That childish attitude

166
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,541
is why your parents don't
wanna get you one.

167
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,541
[MINA]
I'm not childish!

168
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,833
Hit me with a scary story!

169
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,416
What, you think
not getting scared

170
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,916
means you're not childish?

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
[SANAE]
Mm-hmm.

172
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,500
Yeah. So what? It's true!

173
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,500
Just tell me one, okay?

174
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,041
Late one night.

175
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,125
You get a call from an unknown
number on your new phone.

176
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,416
You answer it
and hear something soft.

177
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,166
A faint groaning of some sort.

178
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,416
You quickly hit "end call,"

179
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,083
and never hear from
that number again.

180
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:02,916
[MINA]
That's goo--

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,291
But you're just so curious,

182
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,875
you have to call back.

183
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,541
[MINA gasps]
Why?

184
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,833
But this time,

185
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,916
you hear nothing on
the other end of the line.

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,125
[MINA]
What a relief.

187
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,750
At the end of the month.

188
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,875
You look at your phone bill

189
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,583
and find a hundred
thousand yen charge.

190
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,083
[YUKARI shrieks]

191
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,250
If that happened
my parents would kill me!

192
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,916
[MINA] You're gonna kill me if
you keep screaming like that!

193
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,250
[NISHIKATA]
"Horror."

194
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,125
[door slides open]

195
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,000
Huh? Good morning, Nishikata.

196
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,625
[NISHIKATA]
Hey. Morning.

197
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,208
[TAKAGI] I see you decided
to keep your promise.

198
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,916
I appreciate that.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,375
[NISHIKATA]
Well, yeah.

200
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,375
[yawns]

201
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,416
Let me help.

202
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,208
Sure, thank you.

203
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,791
[yawns]

204
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,375
You're looking tired today.

205
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,291
Really?

206
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,250
Guess so.

207
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,750
Were you up late again?

208
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,583
Watching a recording
of <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> ?

209
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,375
[NISHIKATA]
Huh? No!

210
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,708
[TAKAGI]
Really?

211
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,916
What was it, then?

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,041
Nothing worth mentioning.

213
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,083
[TAKAGI] Were you messaging
some of your friends?

214
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,500
[NISHIKATA]
Uh. Kinda.

215
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,041
What about?

216
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,000
[NISHIKATA]
That's weird.

217
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,666
It's unusual for her to pry
into something this much.

218
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,833
Wait a second.

219
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,166
Fun, right?

220
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,333
I mean, messaging your friends

221
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,375
when you get your
very first cell phone.

222
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:43,333
Honestly, I was hooked
when I got mine, too.

223
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,750
And then before you know it,

224
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,041
you end up getting in trouble
for doing it too much.

225
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,708
[NISHIKATA] Takagi messaged
someone enough times

226
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,583
to get in trouble?

227
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,291
Who does she know that well?

228
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,833
Oh yeah?

229
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,750
With a girl from class I assume?

230
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,208
[TAKAGI]
Nope.

231
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,833
[NISHIKATA]
Calm down.

232
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,166
She's tricked you with
something like this before.

233
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,708
The last time I rode on
the back of someone's bike.

234
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,250
I was riding with my dad.

235
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,916
[NISHIKATA]
I know!

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,416
Was it your dad?

237
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,750
[TAKAGI] Why would I get in
trouble for texting my dad?

238
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,750
[NISHIKATA]
Touché.

239
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,625
[TAKAGI]
Curious?

240
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,666
[NISHIKATA]
Not really.

241
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,750
[TAKAGI] If you tell me what
you chat about with the boys,

242
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,833
I'll tell you who
I was talking about.

243
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,833
Sound like a deal?

244
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,791
[NISHIKATA]
I don't care that much.

245
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,291
[NISHIKATA]
Wait...

246
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,833
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

247
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:44,333
Sorry about this, but your
fun stops here, Takagi.

248
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,500
Actually, yesterday
we were sharing videos.

249
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,458
Mostly funny ones, but there
were a couple others mixed in.

250
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,666
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

251
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,166
Like what?

252
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,875
[NISHIKATA] Yes, yes, by all
means, keep taking the bait.

253
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,000
[NISHIKATA] I'll send her
that link that Kimura sent me.

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,041
[NISHIKATA]
It's thanks to this goat

255
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,333
I didn't sleep well last night.

256
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,458
[phone beep]

257
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,416
[TAKAGI]
Did you send me something?

258
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,958
Yeah.

259
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,416
It's a video of a cute animal
someone sent me last night.

260
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,166
[TAKAGI]
It's not some pervy site, right?

261
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,708
Of course not!

262
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,791
Huh...

263
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,625
Let's see then.

264
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,125
[NISHIKATA] It's so scary that
you'll be at a loss for words!

265
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,000
Just give it a second.

266
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,291
Nishikata?

267
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,083
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah? What's up?

268
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,500
Do you like this stuff?

269
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,333
Like, do you look
at it all the time?

270
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,916
[NISHIKATA]
Huh? Huh?!

271
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,125
Whoa, whoa, hold on,
why is that on your phone?

272
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,333
What even is that?

273
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,833
It's definitely not
what I sent you, is it?

274
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,000
[TAKAGI]
Nope. Just thought I'd ask.

275
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,916
Huh?!

276
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,583
Now then, let's take a
looksee at what you sent.

277
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,250
'Kay?

278
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,208
[NISHIKATA] This is pathetic,
she got me again!

279
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,666
Huh? It is an animal video.

280
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,416
Aww.

281
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,750
He's kinda cute.

282
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,083
Is he a goat?

283
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,375
[NISHIKATA] Good, good,
she's let her guard down.

284
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,000
Here comes the fun part.

285
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,583
[NISHIKATA]
That's it! That's the part!

286
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,041
Cower in fear, Takagi!

287
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,083
Oh. Scary.

288
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,250
Huh?!

289
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,666
Yeah. It is, right?

290
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,958
Crazy scary.

291
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,958
[TAKAGI]
Yeah, then again.

292
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,375
It's not that scary when
you watch it in the morning.

293
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,708
[NISHIKATA]
I'll give her that.

294
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,166
Huh... So this is what
you guys talk about.

295
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,541
Boys are into such weird things.

296
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,750
So I held up my end.

297
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,125
What did you talk about
with who exactly?

298
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,500
[TAKAGI]
Mmm...

299
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,375
Just the usual stuff.

300
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,083
That doesn't answer the
question, and you know it!

301
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,416
[TAKAGI]
It doesn't?

302
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,250
Well, I talk with someone
that starts with "Kuh."

303
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,208
Heh.

304
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,875
That's your clue.

305
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,458
"Kuh"?

306
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,208
Like, Kaede?

307
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,916
[TAKAGI]
Wrong.

308
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,708
After that, is "zih." 

309
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,916
Kuh-zih?

310
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,833
Kazi?

311
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,541
Wait, Kazi?

312
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,708
That boy?

313
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,125
[TAKAGI laughs]
No, it's not Kazi, either.

314
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,250
But the last bit is "in."

315
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,291
Kuh-zih-in?

316
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,500
[TAKAGI laughs]

317
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,666
[NISHIKATA]
What?

318
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,666
[NISHIKATA]
Ninety-seven.

319
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,208
Ninety-eight.

320
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,583
Ninety-nine!

321
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,500
Freakin' Takagi.

322
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,375
I really thought I'd be able to
get back at her for once, today.

323
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,583
But somehow,
she outplayed me yet again.

324
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,208
No.

325
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,041
The day's not over yet.

326
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:18,375
It didn't work in the morning,
but I bet it will at night.

327
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,791
There's an even scarier video
Kimura told me about

328
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,375
after school today.

329
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,333
Since it's scary,
I haven't watched it myself.

330
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,333
But this will surely
freak her ou--

331
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,125
How does she always know?

332
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,250
Why do I get the feeling

333
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,041
I'm gonna have to do more
push-ups after this call?

334
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,875
[TAKAGI]
Hello? Nishikata?

335
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,166
Yeah?

336
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,250
[TAKAGI]
I was thinking it's about time.

337
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,291
Uh. About time for what?

338
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,333
[TAKAGI] For you to
send me a scary video.

339
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,416
[NISHIKATA] Huh? I dunno
what you're talking about.

340
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,916
[TAKAGI]
Huh?

341
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,333
[NISHIKATA]
Get real, Takagi.

342
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,041
You think I'm gonna reveal
my plan just like that?

343
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,791
This battle is far from over--

344
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,666
[TAKAGI] Just you wait until
after we get off the phone.

345
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,541
Huh?!

346
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,791
[TAKAGI]
That's what you were thinking.

347
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,583
What? No. Not me, I wasn't.

348
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,750
[TAKAGI]
Really?

349
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,958
Yes, of course, really.

350
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,250
Then, are you going
to go to sleep soon?

351
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,833
[NISHIKATA]
Uh, yeah. Probably.

352
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,541
[TAKAGI]
I see.

353
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,250
I was just about
to do that, too.

354
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,041
Oh. Cool.

355
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,208
This feels kind of weird.

356
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,666
[NISHIKATA]
Huh?

357
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,125
[TAKAGI] I don't think we've
ever talked to each other

358
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,291
at night before.

359
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,791
Kind of makes my heart flutter.

360
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,791
[TAKAGI]
See you tomorrow, then.

361
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,375
Good night.

362
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,708
Yeah.

363
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,791
G'night to you, too.

364
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,291
[TAKAGI]
Nishikata?

365
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,583
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah?

366
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,083
[TAKAGI]
You haven't hung up yet.

367
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,625
Why not?

368
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,250
I dunno, I think you
should hang up first.

369
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,833
[TAKAGI]
I called you.

370
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,958
So you're supposed to hang up.

371
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,333
And why's that?

372
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,625
[TAKAGI laughs] Okay, okay,
on the count of three.

373
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,833
We'll both hang up.

374
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,541
[TAKAGI]
One, two...

375
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,416
[TAKAGI]
Liar.

376
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,000
C'mon, you didn't
hang up either!

377
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,625
[TAKAGI laughs]

378
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:45,250
[NISHIKATA] Man. Two nights
in a row I can't sleep.

379
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,583
[NISHIKATA]
"Picture."

380
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,833
[TAKAGI]
Those cats are fighting.

381
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,750
Give me like
two minutes, Takagi!

382
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:58,750
What are you doing?

383
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,750
Good. Just like that.

384
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,750
Stay put right there
for me, kitty-cats.

385
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,750
[NISHIKATA]
Yes, that's perfect!

386
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,541
Great.

387
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,333
Add that to my collection
of blurry photos.

388
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,416
What's with you?

389
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,375
Into photography now?

390
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,541
No, not particularly.

391
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,791
I'm just competing with the guys

392
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,791
to see who can
take the best picture.

393
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,291
Has anyone already
taken the lead?

394
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,416
[NISHIKATA] Yeah, Kimura's
unbeatable with this.

395
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,916
Whoa!

396
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,500
Gotta admire the commitment.

397
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,625
[TAKAGI]
Funny pictures are great.

398
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,416
[NISHIKATA]
Mm-hmm.

399
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,958
Wait! I've got an idea!

400
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,083
Let me take a picture
of that funny face you do!

401
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,166
Huh?

402
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,958
That can totally beat
Super Ponpoko!

403
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,041
Help me out!

404
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,625
[TAKAGI]
Hmmm...

405
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,625
I'll agree on the condition that
you do anything I ask of you.

406
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,916
Huh? What kind of "anything"?

407
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The word pretty
much covers it all.

408
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,208
[NISHIKATA]
Scary!

409
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,333
She has what it takes
for me to win, but...

410
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,541
Oh. By the way...

411
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,291
[laughs]

412
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,708
That's the one!

413
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:17,916
I did the face.

414
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,250
That was your chance.

415
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,708
Wait! Do it again!

416
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,166
No can do.

417
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,333
[NISHIKATA growls]
No, it's okay.

418
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,166
I know her.

419
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,500
She enjoys this too much.

420
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,583
She'll want to do it again!

421
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,291
I'll just act as though
I'm upset to lead her on.

422
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,166
Hey, guess what?

423
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:35,875
[NISHIKATA]
I knew it!

424
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,875
Here's my chance!

425
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,791
[shrieks]

426
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,541
[laughs]

427
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,375
Really?

428
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,708
You had a toy snake on you?

429
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,291
[TAKAGI]
That's a great picture.

430
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,166
Huh!? Wait,
you took my picture?!

431
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,791
Hey! Delete that!

432
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,875
[TAKAGI]
No way!

433
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,833
It's too good!

434
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,833
If you do anything I ask,

435
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,250
then I'll delete it for you.

436
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,041
[NISHIKATA]
Come on, Takagi!

437
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,375
That was a cheap shot,
and you know it!

438
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,250
[TAKAGI] Wow.
I got such a great picture.

439
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,166
Do you wanna see it?

440
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,166
No, I definitely don't.

441
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,625
[TAKAGI]
Just look!

442
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,666
You had burst mode on?

443
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,125
[TAKAGI]
Cool, huh?

444
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,041
The way your face changes?

445
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:26,875
[laughs]

446
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,750
[NISHIKATA]
Takagi, you're the worst!

447
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,833
[NISHIKATA]
I know!

448
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,166
I'll take a picture
of her laughing

449
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,416
with her mouth hanging
wide open, just like that!

450
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,250
That'll teach her!

451
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,958
Do I look okay?

452
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,291
Well, we're even now.

453
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,958
[NISHIKATA]
We're not even close to even!

454
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,166
If you want me
to delete this shot,

455
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,125
then you gotta
delete yours, too.

456
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,291
[TAKAGI]
Nuh-uh.

457
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,625
I'll keep it.

458
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,708
So you don't have to
delete my picture, either.

459
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,833
Wait.

460
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,875
But that's not the point.

461
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,250
Well, see ya.

462
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,750
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah.

463
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,166
She had fun.

464
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,875
But I didn't get a single funny
picture to show the guys.

465
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,458
Hey, Nishikata?

466
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:27,291
Do me a favor, and don't
show my picture to anyone.

467
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,416
It's embarrassing.

468
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,125
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah, right.

469
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,125
Like I could show
this to anyone!

470
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,458
What would people say about
me having a photo like this?

471
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,833
It's not worth keeping!

472
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,750
Better delete it.

473
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,083
[NISHIKATA]
She did say it's embarrassing.

474
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,208
So maybe I can use it for some
kind of blackmail one day.

475
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,083
[NISHIKATA]
Might as well keep it.

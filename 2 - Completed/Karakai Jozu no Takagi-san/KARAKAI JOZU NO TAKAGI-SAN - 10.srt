1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,416
[NISHIKATA groans]

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
There's gotta be some way I can
beat Takagi at her own game.

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:20,000
I gotta get that last laugh!

4
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,041
Or, at the very least,
I have to do something

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,625
to stop her from
teasing me every day.

6
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,458
[gasps]
Sorry, I didn't see you--!

7
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,625
[TAKAGI]
Hey, Nishikata.

8
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,791
Good morning.

9
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,458
Oh. Ah. Good morning.

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,083
Uh. Something wrong?

11
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,250
Oh, no.

12
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,541
Not at all.

13
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,791
[TAKAGI]
Hmm...

14
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,750
Well, you want to go
to school together?

15
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,500
Uh...

16
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,083
Sure.

17
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,791
[NISHIKATA]
"Who's Taller?"

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,416
[NISHIKATA]
Did she see that?

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,958
Did she see me
apologize to a pole?

20
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:34,916
Hey, Nishikata.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,250
Yeah? What's up?

22
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,000
Want to tandem ride?

23
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,208
You already know my answer.

24
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,666
We'll get in trouble
if we're seen.

25
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,250
You're just too embarrassed.

26
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,625
No, I am not!

27
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,583
Yeah. Right.

28
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,708
[NISHIKATA] Well, she hasn't
said anything strange.

29
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,166
Guess she must have
just missed seeing me.

30
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,708
Phew.

31
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,458
Took you long enough.

32
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,250
Breaking out the winter uniform?

33
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,375
Yeah. It's been getting
colder lately,

34
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,083
so I thought the time
was just about right.

35
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,333
Wh-What?

36
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,875
Did you grow?

37
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,500
Huh?

38
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,500
I think that uniform looked

39
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,833
a little bigger on
you last spring.

40
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,625
[NISHIKATA] Now that I think
about it, she might be right.

41
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,166
This thing feels like it
was tailor-made for me.

42
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,791
I didn't even notice.

43
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,458
Could it be?

44
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,166
Am I finally having
a growth spurt?

45
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,458
[chuckles]

46
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,000
Man.

47
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,750
I'm growing so much lately,
I might need a new uniform soon.

48
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,291
Must be one of those
"growth spurts."

49
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,583
But by comparison,
you sure haven't changed much,

50
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,583
have you, Takagi?

51
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,250
[TAKAGI]
That's sexual harassment.

52
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,291
"Haven't changed much."

53
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,625
[NISHIKATA]
N-No!

54
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,041
That's--

55
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,333
Come on, you know that's
not what I was talking about.

56
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,583
Uh. I was talking
about your height.

57
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,250
Huh? Well, yeah, I was too.

58
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,333
Why, what did you think I meant?

59
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,750
N-Nothing.

60
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,750
Oh?

61
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,416
Now what?

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,208
[TAKAGI]
Hmm...

63
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,541
You know what?

64
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,375
I take it back, maybe
you haven't gotten taller.

65
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,666
Huh?!

66
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,625
What do you mean?

67
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,208
I totally grew!

68
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:30,000
In fact, I'd be willing to bet
I'm taller than you now, Takagi!

69
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,458
Yeah? Do you care
to find out for sure?

70
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,291
[NISHIKATA]
Why're we doing it here?

71
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,166
[TAKAGI] So we can take
our shoes off to be fair.

72
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,541
[NISHIKATA]
We're gonna be late for school.

73
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,541
[TAKAGI]
Nah, this'll be quick.

74
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,833
Here, turn around.

75
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,541
[TAKAGI]
Let's see.

76
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,583
[NISHIKATA]
She's kinda... warm.

77
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,500
[TAKAGI]
Uhh...

78
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,041
[NISHIKATA]
So, Takagi?

79
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,208
[TAKAGI]
Huh?

80
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,958
Normally, wouldn't
you stand against a wall

81
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,791
and make a mark
to measure height?

82
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,041
Yeah, but I think
it's more accurate

83
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,958
if we stand together like this.

84
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,083
[TAKAGI] I think we're
about the same height.

85
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,541
[NISHIKATA]
Huh? Really?

86
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,291
Really.

87
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,958
If you don't believe me,
check for yourself.

88
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,000
No way, you're right.

89
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,666
Told yah.

90
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,791
Hey.

91
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,458
You're not like,
on your tiptoes are you?

92
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,666
[TAKAGI]
Why? You don't trust me?

93
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,166
All right then.

94
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,791
Is this better?

95
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,125
You'll be able to tell
if I'm cheating now.

96
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,833
Uh. Yeah. I guess.

97
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,166
Wait.

98
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,625
Now it kinda looks like.

99
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,833
I'm taller.

100
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,375
That's because I was
on my tiptoes before.

101
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,875
[NISHIKATA] So you were
cheating, I called it!

102
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:19,708
You're a liar!

103
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,791
[laughs]

104
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,916
I never said I wasn't
on my tiptoes.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,208
Good for you though.

106
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,041
You're taller after all.

107
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,416
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah, walk away.

108
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,833
You're acting all
cool on the outside,

109
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,916
but on the inside,
I bet you're really bitter!

110
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,291
Oh. By the way,

111
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,208
if you think I'm bitter,
you're wrong.

112
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,708
Know why?

113
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,333
When your body grows too fast.

114
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,666
You might run into things.

115
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,958
Like, utility poles.

116
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,041
Huh?

117
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,291
Wait! Does that mean
you saw me do that?

118
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,041
Are you ready?

119
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,083
School's a-waitin'!

120
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,875
Takagi.

121
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,708
Hey.

122
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,416
Takagi?

123
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,541
So cold.

124
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,208
I dunno, I feel fine.

125
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,375
You're so sensitive
to the cold, Yukari.

126
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,791
Take that!

127
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,291
[YUKARI]
Mina, your hand is freezing!

128
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,666
[SANAE]
"I Hate the Cold"

129
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,416
[YUKARI]
Jeez.

130
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,333
You do that again,
and I'll hate you forever.

131
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,166
[SANAE]
Forever?

132
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,166
[YUKARI shrieks]

133
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,458
[laughter]

134
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,083
[YUKARI]
Will you stop it?

135
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,000
Why?

136
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,416
[YUKARI]
Because I hate it!

137
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,541
Why are your hands
so cold anyway?

138
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,250
[laughs]
You know why.

139
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,500
You just don't
want to accept it.

140
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,791
People who have cold
hands have warm hearts!

141
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,500
I don't think a person
with a warm heart

142
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,833
would enjoy torturing
their friends for kicks.

143
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,041
Now, now.

144
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,208
There's no need
to hold a grudge.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,125
[YUKARI]
I'm not kidding.

146
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,791
If you do it again,
I'm gonna be really mad.

147
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,625
[MINA]
You're already mad.

148
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,291
[SANAE]
Gotcha.

149
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,083
[shrieks]
So cold!

150
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,541
[laughs]
Stop it!

151
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,958
I said stop, Sanae!

152
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,666
That's the "My heart
is so warm" attack.

153
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,708
[MINA]
Help me, Yukari!

154
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,875
[YUKARI]
Take this!

155
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,583
Now let's see how you like it!

156
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,166
Your hands are so warm.
It's scary.

157
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,458
That must mean
you've got a cold heart.

158
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,666
[YUKARI] That is not what
it means and you know it!

159
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,625
Stay away, cold-heart!

160
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,083
[YUKARI] Prepare for the
"Cold heart frozen soul" attack!

161
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:46,958
[SANAE]
Equally as fearsome!

162
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,791
[MINA]
It's not even close!

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,666
[TAKAGI]
Hey.

164
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,208
So cold!

165
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,250
What'd you do that for?

166
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,416
Get me back if you can.

167
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,666
[MINA]
You get back here!

168
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,750
[YUKARI whines]
Stop that!

169
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,208
Quadruple cold hands!

170
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,750
[MINA]
Four times the power!

171
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,708
No way can I do that.

172
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,625
[screams]

173
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,458
Will you stop it?!

174
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,791
Your hands are cold as ice!

175
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,833
Leave me alone!

176
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,208
Did you know
they say that people

177
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,875
with cold hands
have warm hearts?

178
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:24,750
[NISHIKATA growls]

179
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,333
Nope!

180
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,416
It's Takagi and
Nishikata, again.

181
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,041
I saw them show up
to school together today.

182
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,625
Those two are so close.

183
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,083
Well, maybe they are going out.

184
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,791
[TAKAO, KIMURA]
"Invitation."

185
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,500
[YUKARI]
I really can't help but wonder.

186
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,875
Do you think they're going out?

187
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,916
Who knows?

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,958
You don't sound very interested.

189
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,041
They're so close,
it makes me want to know.

190
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:56,958
Why is that?

191
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,541
Are you jealous of them?

192
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,375
[gasps]

193
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,833
Am I jealous?

194
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,583
Well, not exactly, but...

195
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,083
Mina.

196
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,791
Yukari says she wishes she
had a boy she could flirt with.

197
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,791
That's not even
close to what I said!

198
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,000
Hey.

199
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,916
You listening?

200
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,333
[SANAE]
Mina?

201
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,750
Sanae!

202
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,875
I'm on the toilet. Don't talk
to me right now, please!

203
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,791
You're gonna make me
lose my concentration!

204
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,833
Huh?

205
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,916
You are too much
sometimes, Sanae.

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,708
It's good.

207
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,125
You should watch it later.

208
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,750
[STUDENT]
Really? Cool, I will!

209
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,708
[SANAE]
Hey, Takagi?

210
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,833
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

211
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:38,541
[NISHIKATA chuckles] I just
came up with the perfect plan!

212
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,708
It's the ultimate, fail-proof
plot to tease Takagi

213
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,208
on our way home from school!

214
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,708
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

215
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,833
What are you smirking to
yourself about over there?

216
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,083
Something pervy?

217
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,250
No.

218
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,125
It's nothing dirty
or weird or whatever.

219
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,333
Dirty or weird?

220
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,291
That's what I said!

221
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,125
[laughs]

222
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,916
Your face is turning red.

223
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,750
[NISHIKATA]
Whatever.

224
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,375
Just you wait
until after school!

225
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,875
By the way, Nishikata.

226
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,708
Later, do you wanna
walk home together?

227
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,583
Yeah, sure!

228
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,291
[NISHIKTA]
Oh, no!

229
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,583
Was I too eager?

230
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,458
Did she realize
I'm up to something?

231
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,833
[coughs]

232
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,958
I mean.

233
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,166
Yeah, sure.

234
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,916
Isn't that what you just said?

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,291
Uh-huh.

236
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,166
That a problem?

237
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,625
[TAKAGI]
Hmm...

238
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,166
No.

239
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,708
But just in case you change
your mind before school's out,

240
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:38,208
you can give me a
definite answer later.

241
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,666
See ya.

242
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,875
[NISHIKATA]
Well that was weird.

243
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,916
As long as she isn't on to me,
I guess it's fine.

244
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,083
[KIMURA]
Hey, Nishikata!

245
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,708
We were gonna play
"Super-Pro" at my house today.

246
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,208
You want in on that?

247
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,125
Um...

248
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,125
Sorry. I can't today.

249
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,791
You spending time with
your girlfriend again?

250
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,000
My "girlfriend"?

251
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,000
Takagi, right?

252
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,083
I called it.

253
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,416
Huh?! What are
you talking about?

254
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,916
We're not like that at all!

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
[MINA] It's true, Takagi and
Nishikata are not going out.

256
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,666
I know 'cuz we just asked
her in the bathroom

257
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,541
Aw, really?

258
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,541
Yeah!

259
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,250
Oh man, I seriously gotta go.

260
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,833
Bathroom, here I come.

261
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,250
Uhh... What was she doing

262
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,666
in the bathroom before
if she has to go now?

263
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,666
All right, putting that aside,

264
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,083
if you're not
going out with her,

265
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,541
why are you walking
home with her for like,

266
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,875
the hundredth time?

267
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,250
Well, because she asked me to?

268
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,666
Asked you?

269
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,375
And you're sure that's not
because you're going out?

270
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,958
Uh.

271
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,083
I don't think so, at least.

272
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,208
[TAKAO]
Hmm?

273
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,333
Okay, whatever.

274
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,375
Hey, isn't next
period in the lab?

275
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,375
You're right, let's hurry!

276
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,916
[NISHIKATA]
No way.

277
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,541
I don't buy it.

278
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,000
Takagi just wants to tease me.

279
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,208
[MINA]
Ready to get going?

280
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,208
Yeah. But we're going
straight home today, okay?

281
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,208
Huh?!

282
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,958
But I had it all planned out!

283
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,166
I wanted to get
a Ponkan Popsicle!

284
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,291
Don't you think it's
a little bit cold for that?

285
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,833
Not when you go inside
and pump the heat it's not!

286
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,958
You said it.

287
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,166
[NISHIKATA] If she's not
gonna say anything about it,

288
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,875
then to give her
my "definite" answer,

289
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,833
I've gotta ask her myself.

290
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,208
[NISHIKATA]
That's kinda embarrassing

291
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,375
now that I'm face
to face with it.

292
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,250
I've never been the one to ask
her to walk home with me before.

293
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,833
[TAKAGI]
Nishikata.

294
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,583
Yeah? What's goin' on?

295
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,791
Oh, good!

296
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,666
If she asks me,
all I have to do is say yes!

297
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,791
That's easy!

298
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,333
[TAKAGI]
You know what?

299
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,541
Earlier today someone asked me
if I was going out with you.

300
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,833
Huh?!

301
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:57,833
And...

302
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,416
After I told them we weren't,

303
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,166
they said that they
thought I liked you.

304
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,750
I'm always asking you
to walk home with me.

305
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,791
Maybe that's why
they thought that.

306
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,708
[NISHIKATA]
I should have known!

307
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,750
This is what you were
after the whole time!

308
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,416
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

309
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,708
[NISHIKATA]
You orchestrated everything,

310
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,458
so I have no choice but to ask
you to walk home with me!

311
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,083
Just so you can watch me squirm!

312
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,375
You okay?

313
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,958
[NISHIKATA]
Try to sound calm.

314
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,458
Just say something like,
"Oh yeah? That's funny."

315
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:31,750
Oh yeah? Tha-That's funny!

316
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,500
Nice!

317
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,208
Uh.

318
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,333
So, anyway.

319
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,875
About your request
from this morning.

320
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,166
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

321
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,125
Uh.

322
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,708
I don't have any plans, so uh...

323
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,458
Let's...

324
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,500
"Let's" what?

325
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,166
[NISHIKATA]
Hang in there, man!

326
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,208
If you can get through this,

327
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:57,083
then you get your chance
to mess with Takagi!

328
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,833
Let's walk home together.

329
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,666
I'll have to think about it.

330
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,083
Huh?!

331
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,208
[laughs]

332
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,541
I'm just kidding.

333
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,041
Let's go.

334
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,583
[TAKAGI]
I can't wait.

335
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,708
Because... it looks like
you're scheming something.

336
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,708
[NISHIKATA]
She's on to me!

337
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,250
[TAKAGI] If she's already
suspicious of me,

338
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,375
should I hold
off on my plan?

339
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,875
But I came up with
such a good idea!

340
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,083
Not that I've thought about
how to carry out said idea

341
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,333
to begin with, though.

342
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,708
[TAKAGI]
Want to get some juice?

343
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,916
Now that I think about it,
my mouth is dry.

344
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,291
[TAKAGI]
Aww.

345
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,625
Most of them are sold out.

346
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,958
[NISHIKATA groans] I really
wanted to get something cold.

347
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,416
But all they have is...

348
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,833
Sweet red bean soup
and whatever that is!

349
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,833
What do we do?

350
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,875
[NISHIKATA]
I need something,

351
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,916
but I'm in a no-win
situation here!

352
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,500
[NISHIKATA]
A "no-win situation"?

353
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,166
Should we find another
vending machine?

354
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,750
[NISHIKATA]
Nah.

355
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,291
I'm thirsty, so I guess...

356
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,750
...I'll just go for this one.

357
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,208
Gross.

358
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,208
[laughs]

359
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,083
With a name like that, duh.

360
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,208
[NISHIKATA]
On any other day,

361
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,750
I'd completely
regret buying this.

362
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,708
But now I know for sure
that my new plan will work!

363
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,291
Hey, Takagi.

364
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,500
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

365
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,625
Say there's one juice
that's really tasty

366
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,791
but gives you a fever.

367
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,416
And another that's
just plain disgusting.

368
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,458
Which would you choose?

369
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,458
[TAKAGI]
Hmm...

370
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,500
[NISHIKATA]
"Two-Choice Question."

371
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,750
One juice that's really
tasty but gives you a fever

372
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:15,041
and another that's
just plain disgusting?

373
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:15,916
Hmm...

374
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,875
[NISHIKATA]
How's it feel?

375
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,000
You can't decide, can you?

376
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,125
Feel the unease!

377
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,333
I want to see
your face contorted

378
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,708
with conflicting emotions!

379
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,208
'Kay, question.

380
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,583
So if I drank the tasty juice
and got a fever.

381
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,166
Would you come and visit me
while I'm stuck at home?

382
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,208
What?

383
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,000
What's the point
in asking me that?

384
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,625
Does it affect your answer?

385
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,041
Significantly.

386
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,625
You wouldn't visit, then?

387
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,041
[NISHIKATA]
Uh.

388
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,958
Hey. I didn't say that.
Don't put words in my mouth.

389
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,000
If you were out sick,
then I'd visit you.

390
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,666
Then I'd take the tasty one.

391
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,500
[NISHIKATA]
Well, this is weird.

392
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,791
What's going on?

393
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,666
I expected her to be conflicted,

394
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,916
but she doesn't have
a care in the world.

395
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,041
Hold on.

396
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,000
I feel a little weird now.

397
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,541
Am I the loser here?

398
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,000
Has my "two-choice
question" plan failed?

399
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,416
No, it's still too
early to give up!

400
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,083
'Kay!

401
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,666
Next question!

402
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,791
[TAKAGI]
Okay.

403
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,750
No more allowance
for your whole life,

404
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,791
or no more teasing me ever?!

405
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,458
No allowance for life.

406
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,166
So quick!

407
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,333
I'd be fine.

408
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,541
I've been saving up
my New Year's money

409
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,708
and anything else I've
gotten for a while.

410
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,333
And once I'm in high school,
I'd just get a job.

411
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:37,041
Clearly, the better
choice is to keep teasing you.

412
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,875
[NISHIKATA growls]
I underestimated her!

413
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,666
I'll need a better
question than that.

414
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,708
Nishikata.

415
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,125
What?

416
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,625
Well, you've asked me
two weird questions in a row.

417
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,291
What's your angle?

418
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,875
Are you just trying
to give me a hard time?

419
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,791
Huh?

420
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,958
Not really.

421
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:56,791
Fine.

422
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,541
Then I'll ask you one, now.

423
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,541
Would you rather
that I disappear

424
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,291
or that you'd have to
be teased by me forever?

425
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,750
What'll you choose?

426
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,833
Huh?

427
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,083
What do you mean "disappear?"

428
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,000
Poof, I'm gone.

429
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,625
[NISHIKATA] I don't want to be
teased for the rest of my life

430
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,333
but for her to disappear?

431
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,541
That feels like a step too far.

432
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,541
I'd, uh, choose to be teased.

433
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,583
Thought so.

434
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,291
You do like being teased.

435
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,291
No, I don't!

436
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,416
Why would anyone like that?

437
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,625
It's just...

438
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,125
I don't exactly want you
to disappear either.

439
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,416
That would suck.

440
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,625
You want to be with me?

441
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,625
That it?

442
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,541
That's not...

443
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,666
[laughs]

444
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,291
Made you blush!

445
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,375
[NISHIKATA] Man, why does
she always have to do this?

446
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,916
Is it that fun to see me
uncomfortable?

447
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,666
I gotta come up with a good
question to get back at her.

448
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,791
Question two.

449
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,625
[NISHIKATA]
Huh? You're not done?

450
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:58,166
You get zeroes on all
tests for the rest of your life,

451
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,041
or you have kiss me.

452
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,250
Which is it?

453
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,500
A "kiss"?!

454
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,583
Gotta choose one.

455
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,125
I'd get a zero even
if I study well?

456
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,000
Yep.

457
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,541
It doesn't matter what you do.

458
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,958
[NISHIKATA]
I couldn't live with that!

459
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,375
My parents would take away
my allowance immediately,

460
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,208
and there's no way
I'd get into high school!

461
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,416
But if choose the kiss,

462
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,083
she's gonna make fun of me
like there's no tomorrow!

463
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,916
Hard decision, huh?

464
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,333
[NISHIKATA]
Man!

465
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,833
The more I struggle to choose,
the happier she gets!

466
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,583
I gotta choose quickly.

467
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,791
All zeroes for life is too much!

468
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,916
But!

469
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,791
I have no choice!

470
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,750
I'll pick not getting zeroes
on my tests.

471
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,666
Sorry, which option
was that again?

472
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,541
Th-The one with the kiss.

473
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:59,041
Ho, ho?

474
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,250
Is that so?

475
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,833
Okay, then.

476
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,625
[TAKAGI]
Aww, man.

477
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,708
Looks like you were right.

478
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,041
You are taller than me.

479
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,333
What's with that look?

480
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,500
I was just making sure.

481
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,166
[NISHIKATA sighs]

482
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,541
She's messed with me
so many times today.

483
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,833
But I have this
all figured out now.

484
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,833
One option has to be
something she'd never choose,

485
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,541
and the other just has to be
something I can

486
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,041
make fun of her for picking!

487
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,208
That way, I win no matter what!

488
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,708
Okay, Takagi. I got one--

489
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,375
All right, next question.

490
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,458
You have to go around the school
while doing a handstand,

491
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,500
or you and I--

492
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,000
[NISHIKATA]
Whoa, hold on a second!

493
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,000
I can't even do a hand stand,
that option doesn't work!

494
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,666
And when can I ask
the questions again?

495
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,500
[TAKAGI] As soon as you're done
answering my questions.

496
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,083
[NISHIKATA]
What? Why?

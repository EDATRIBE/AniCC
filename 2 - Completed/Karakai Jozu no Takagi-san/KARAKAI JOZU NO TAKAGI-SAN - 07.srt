1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,916
A brand new issue.

2
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,666
Day-one purchase.

3
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,125
[NISHIKATA]
"Shopping."

4
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,166
[TAKAGI'S MOM]
Here you go.

5
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,625
[TAKAGI]
Thanks, Mom.

6
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,375
[TAKAGI'S MOM] I have a
few stores I want to browse,

7
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,583
so let's meet back here
when you're done.

8
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,375
[TAKAGI]
Gotcha.

9
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:08,625
[TAKAGI'S MOM] And don't get
anything too showy, okay?

10
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,375
I won't.

11
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,125
Thank you, come again.

12
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:16,208
[NISHIKATA chuckles] Volume
five of <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> !

13
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,916
I wonder what type
I should try on first.

14
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,666
[TAKAGI]
Hmm...

15
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,916
Actually, what type
does he like?

16
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,333
[TAKAGI]
Hmm...

17
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,333
[NISHIKATA]
I can't wait to get home

18
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,250
and read this cover to cover!

19
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,000
Nishikata!

20
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,750
[NISHIKATA shrieks]

21
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,625
What are you doing here?

22
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,500
[TAKAGI]
Uh, shopping?

23
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,625
Same as you.

24
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,208
[NISHIKATA]
Again?

25
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,916
Why does she always have to show
up at the worst possible time?

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,958
I swear, she's gotta be
following me or something!

27
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,083
No.

28
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,291
Now's not the time
to think about that.

29
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,166
I need to focus
my energy into making sure

30
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,083
she doesn't find
out what I bought.

31
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,333
Anyway, I saw you
leaving the bookstore.

32
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,250
[NISHIKATA]
Here it comes!

33
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,041
Gotta think quick!

34
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,416
[TAKAGI]
Did you buy somethi--?

35
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,041
So you're shopping?
That's cool! Whatcha getting?

36
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,041
[NISHIKATA]
That was too close a call.

37
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,541
I hope changing the subject is
enough to get out of this alive.

38
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,958
Mainly, a bathing suit.

39
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,666
[NISHIKATA]
A bathing suit?

40
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,333
Are you blushing?

41
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,000
No, it's just hot in here!

42
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,750
Hey.

43
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,541
What kind of girl's bathing suit
do you think looks best?

44
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,333
Uh, what kind of...?
Why you asking me?

45
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,791
I-I don't know,
they're all probably fine.

46
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,833
You've seen 'em all?

47
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,291
You're quite the connoisseur.

48
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,541
No, you don't get it!

49
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,958
I mean that
I couldn't care less!

50
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,083
I'm not some expert!

51
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:32,958
Hot in here?

52
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,166
Yes, it's hot in here.

53
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,083
Typical. Of course,
she messes with me

54
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,791
the second we
bump into each other.

55
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,291
All right,
I'm gonna go home now.

56
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,833
[TAKAGI]
'Kay.

57
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,708
[NISHIKATA] At least, I was able
to hide the manga from her.

58
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,333
You just bought the new volume
of <i>Unrequited Love,</i> right?

59
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,250
Could I borrow it?

60
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,250
[NISHIKATA]
I was so close!

61
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,708
Was she watching me?

62
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,166
[chuckles]

63
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,083
I don't know what
you're talking about.

64
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,416
You don't? Was I wrong?

65
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,083
[NISHIKATA]
Hey, wait.

66
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,916
There's no way she could
have seen from outside

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,541
with the register where it is.

68
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,583
She's bluffing.

69
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,500
[chuckles]

70
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,791
Dodged a bullet there.

71
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,208
Yeah, totally wrong.

72
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,833
You couldn't be more off.

73
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,791
Oh yeah?

74
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,750
Then what did you buy?

75
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,416
[NISHIKATA]
Uh, <i>Robot Zombie</i> ?

76
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,125
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah, sure, whatever, that!

77
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,625
It's like, the last thing a
girl would be interested in!

78
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,833
It's way too ridiculous!

79
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,708
Yeah, right.

80
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,666
You bought <i>Unrequited Love,</i>
didn't you?

81
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,333
Yup! Sure did!

82
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,916
Gah!

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,458
N-No.

84
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,208
Let me see it, then.

85
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,666
[NISHIKATA] Man. She backed
me into a corner again.

86
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,416
[NISHIKATA]
This is what always happens.

87
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,458
No matter what I do, I can never
beat Takagi at her own game.

88
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,916
[gasps]

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,458
Wait, I take that back.

90
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,750
Okay, but first,
shall we make a bet?

91
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,833
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

92
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,083
[NSHIKATA]
We can bet on whether or not

93
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,166
the book I bought is
<i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

94
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,000
I say our usual
condition applies.

95
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,500
If you're wrong, you have
to do whatever I tell you to.

96
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,875
Fine with me.

97
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,583
And if I get it right,
then you do whatever I want.

98
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,666
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah, okay.

99
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,333
So, then what is it you
think I purchased?

100
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,500
Heh.

101
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,541
It's all in the presentation.

102
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,041
It's your move, Takagi.

103
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,416
I'm sure my level of confidence

104
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,708
will have you second
guessing yourself.

105
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,083
[TAKAGI]
Huh?

106
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,166
Nishikata sounds so much
more confident than normal.

107
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,666
Maybe it's actually not
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i> !

108
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,041
[NISHIKATA] Oh yeah.
If she's gonna find out anyway,

109
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,458
I might as well teach her
a lesson in the process.

110
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,416
Think you can just
get me like that again?

111
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,416
Nuh-uh. I've learned.

112
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,541
Know what?

113
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,583
I'm gonna bet that it's
<i>Unrequited Love.</i>

114
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,250
Huh?

115
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,500
Y-You sure about that?

116
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,250
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hmm.

117
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,500
Let's see it.

118
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,541
Awesome!

119
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,166
I got it right!

120
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,166
[NISHIKATA] I don't know how she
saw through me that time.

121
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,083
I should just go home
and read this.

122
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,208
That'll make me feel better.

123
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,750
Ugh. I'll see yah around.

124
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,625
[TAKAGI]
Where do you think you're going?

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,958
Help me out.

126
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,125
I need a bathing suit.

127
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,541
We said if I won.

128
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,666
I'd get to tell you
what to do, didn't we?

129
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,375
[NISHIKATA]
I have to help her pick one?

130
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,166
Hot in here?

131
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,083
Yes, it's still hot!

132
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,208
[NISHIKATA]
"Bathing Suit."

133
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,458
Which one do you like most?

134
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,750
Uh. They all look nice to me.

135
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,833
[TAKAGI] Will you actually
look and pick one?

136
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,625
You did lose our bet.

137
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,166
[NISHIKATA]
I don't think she realizes

138
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,833
what she's asking of me.

139
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,458
It's embarrassing
just being here!

140
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,958
I can't look directly
at the bathing suits!

141
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,208
Oh. Check it out.

142
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,625
What do you think of this one?

143
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,166
[NISHIKATA]
I guess I just have to pick one

144
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,666
if I want to get this over with.

145
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,375
I-I think that one's nice.

146
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,875
[TAKAGI]
Oh?

147
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,166
In that case,
I might as well try it on.

148
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,000
Huh?

149
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,083
Stay right there.

150
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,041
I'll only be a minute.

151
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,958
[NISHIKATA]
What am I doing?

152
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,666
How did I end up
in this situation?

153
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,958
Right now, just
beyond that curtain.

154
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:11,541
Takagi is taking off her...

155
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,500
How's it look?

156
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,750
I dunno, fine?

157
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,125
That's all?

158
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,541
I'll try on another, then.

159
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,041
[NISHIKATA]
You mean you're not done?

160
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,333
Until you tell me
I look good in one.

161
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,250
No, I'm not.

162
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,750
[NISHIKATA] Huh?
Tell her she looks good?

163
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,166
That's way too
embarrassing for me to say!

164
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,708
[TAKAGI]
Hey, Nishikata.

165
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,000
Sorry, can you hand
me that bathing suit?

166
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:48,875
Huh?!

167
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,208
The yellow one I was looking at.

168
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,916
[NISHIKATA] She's covering
herself, does that mean?

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,041
It's to the left of that one.

170
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,500
Uh-huh, that's it.

171
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,458
[NISHIKATA]
Just a few feet to my right.

172
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,708
She's totally naked.

173
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,625
Sorry again.

174
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,125
[gasps]

175
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,666
Thanks a bunch.

176
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,208
[NISHIKATA]
Oh, gimme a break!

177
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,333
That was totally on purpose!

178
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,750
But forget that,

179
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,166
I need to get out of this
store as soon as possible.

180
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,666
If someone from school
sees me here with Takagi,

181
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,458
I'll never hear the end of it.

182
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,958
Wow, there are so many!

183
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,333
All right! How's this one?

184
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,958
Uh.

185
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,541
Oh. Hi, Takagi!

186
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,250
Hey, Mano!

187
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,208
Hey, Nakai.

188
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,708
Uh, hey, what's goin' on?

189
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,125
You're here
to get a bathing suit?

190
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,458
Yeah, I assume that's
why you're here, too?

191
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,250
Ow...

192
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,458
Hey, Mano, it's
embarrassing being here.

193
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,166
Can we hurry it up already?

194
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,041
Wha?! We've barely
been here five minutes!

195
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,208
If I rush, I might miss
something I'd really like!

196
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,708
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

197
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,125
[gasps]

198
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,083
How 'bout we come back later?

199
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,625
What? But you said--

200
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,208
It doesn't matter.

201
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,083
See you later, Takagi!

202
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,750
'Kay!

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,958
[gasps]

204
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,833
Don't worry, the coast is clear.

205
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,250
They're gone.

206
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,750
Oh. Is that so?

207
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,125
[TAKAGI]
You get so shy sometimes

208
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:13,875
What do you mean?

209
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,125
No I don't.

210
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,083
[TAKAGI]
Well then.

211
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,791
[NISHIKATA] Back to
trying on more, I assume.

212
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,000
We should probably hurry up
and pick one of these out.

213
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,916
Otherwise, you'll
die of embarrassment.

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,208
Oh, shut up. I'm fine.

215
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,958
[TAKAGI]
So...

216
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,750
...which of these
do you like better?

217
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,791
Uh. I dunno, whichever
you like, I guess?

218
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,375
[TAKAGI]
Then how about this one here?

219
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,458
Think this one's good?

220
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,416
Uh-huh.

221
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,208
I keep coming back
to this pink one.

222
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,625
Do you think it's good too?

223
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,916
Uh-huh.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,750
And this one-piece?

225
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,083
[NISHIKATA]
Mm-hm.

226
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,500
Wanna go swimming
together sometime?

227
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,166
Uh-huh.

228
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,416
It's a date.

229
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,916
Okay.

230
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,083
I'll buy you something
to drink later.

231
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,375
You're burning up again.

232
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,500
Yeah, I mean,
it is super-hot in here!

233
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,166
They should really
fix the air conditioning!

234
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,375
The ocean!

235
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,750
We swimmin' or what?

236
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,416
[MINA]
Of course we are, come on!

237
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:33,041
[sighs]

238
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,000
[YUKARI]
Water.

239
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,541
[YUKARI]
"Ocean."

240
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,375
[MINA]
We got the waves!

241
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,625
We got the sun!

242
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,708
[SANAE]
We got the seaweed.

243
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,875
Stop Sanae.
It's all gross and slimy!

244
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,375
[MINA]
What are you doing, Yukari?

245
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,375
[sighs] What does
it look like I'm doing?

246
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,333
I'm pumping air into this.

247
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,541
But we're at the beach.

248
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,541
You should at least
go for a swim, first.

249
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,625
I wouldn't be doing this if
I could just jump in the water.

250
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,583
Ah! What, you can't swim?

251
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,458
You do sit out
during swim lessons.

252
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,375
Though you'd probably
learn if you didn't.

253
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,500
[YUKARI]
Whatever.

254
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,500
Just go have fun,
I'll be there soon.

255
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,583
Shoo. Shoo.

256
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,875
Ah! That was fun, but I'm wiped!

257
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,291
Yeah, let's take
a break for now.

258
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,791
Huh?

259
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,583
[MINA]
What happened?

260
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,500
You okay, Yukari?

261
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,708
Yeah, I'm okay.

262
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,625
But I managed to
break the pump somehow.

263
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,166
So I was blowing it up on
my own, and I got winded.

264
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:09,041
Man, Yukari, do you ever have
fun, or do you just suffer?

265
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,916
You don't know my life!

266
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,291
And just for that,

267
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,416
I'm not gonna help you
with your homework anymore!

268
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,166
Hope you can do it on your own!

269
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,125
You what?

270
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,166
But I can't!

271
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,083
Please have mercy!

272
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,458
I won't make fun of you anymore!

273
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,500
Crying won't get you anywhere.

274
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,333
[TAKAGI] Nishikata,
are you making progress

275
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,958
on your summer homework?

276
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,041
[NISHIKATA]
Uh...

277
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,166
Yeah.

278
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,333
I guess you could say that.

279
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,833
Oh?

280
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:45,500
Hey, wanna do our
homework together?

281
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,708
Uh. Yeah, sure, that's cool.

282
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,291
But I have plans
in the afternoon.

283
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,291
That's fine.

284
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,208
Let's just work on
it until noon.

285
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,000
You can copy my answers.

286
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,416
Huh?

287
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,250
Okay, then where
should we do it?

288
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,291
At the library?

289
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,750
Or, wait.

290
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,500
We wouldn't have very much
time to get our stuff, then.

291
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,833
You're overthinking this.

292
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,375
We could just go
over to your house.

293
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,083
[NISHIKATA]
"Room."

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
[NISHIKATA]
What is my life?

295
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,500
Out of nowhere, Takagi,

296
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,458
a girl is coming to my room!

297
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,000
Are we going in?

298
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:33,833
[gasps]

299
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,416
Sorry. Spaced out for a sec.

300
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,166
This place is nice.

301
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,208
[NISHIKATA]
You don't have to be polite.

302
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,875
My parents aren't here anyway.

303
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,208
This feels like a dream.

304
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,916
Is this a dream?

305
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,833
Takagi is actually in my room.

306
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,125
It feels so surreal.

307
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,708
What's wrong?

308
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,083
You spaced out again.

309
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,750
Oh.

310
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,541
It's nothing!

311
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:11,708
Hey!

312
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,625
It's your favorite girl's manga!

313
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,625
[NISHIKATA gasps]

314
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,916
Aww, you found me! Squeal!

315
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,875
[TAKAGI]
You have every volume!

316
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:20,500
Huh?!

317
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,375
Don't touch that!

318
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,250
[gasps]

319
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,583
S-Sorry.

320
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,375
[TAKAGI]
Why are you apologizing?

321
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,166
Well, you know,
because we were just so--

322
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,291
You like this, right?

323
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,166
If you like something,
you should just admit it.

324
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,750
[NISHIKATA]
What does she mean?

325
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,541
"This" as in her being
in my room?

326
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,666
How am I supposed
to respond to that?

327
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,458
Maybe this is a dream after all!

328
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,458
<i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

329
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,750
You do like it, right?

330
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,625
There's really
no need to hide it.

331
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,375
[NISHIKATA] That's what
she was talking about?

332
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,375
Now that I've had a
chance to look around,

333
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,500
this room just screams "you."

334
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,166
Is that supposed
to be a compliment?

335
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,708
[TAKAGI]
Hmm...

336
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,916
No, not exactly.

337
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,375
But either way, I like it.

338
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,416
[NISHIKATA]
W-Want to start our homework?

339
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,666
Read my mind!

340
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,250
[NISHIKATA]
Oh right.

341
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,791
But I only have one desk.

342
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,000
Do you have a folding
table or something?

343
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,500
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah, but they're all being used

344
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,666
in different rooms.

345
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,041
[TAKAGI]
Too bad.

346
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,875
Then should we sit
in the same chair?

347
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,458
[NISHIKATA]
Uh...

348
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,083
Huh?!

349
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,375
[laughs]

350
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,291
I'm just messing around.

351
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,375
Oh, I know.

352
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,791
We could use your bed.

353
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,000
[NISHIKATA]
Uh. Um.

354
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,250
Move this.

355
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,375
And we've basically got
one big desk right here!

356
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,125
You okay?

357
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,708
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

358
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,583
Good idea.

359
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,666
Ohh?

360
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,416
What's the problem?

361
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,666
Lay off.

362
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,875
No problem.

363
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,916
Come on.

364
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,791
Let's start.

365
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,083
[NISHIKATA]
Wait, I'm sitting there, too?

366
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,083
So, hey, uh...

367
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,083
Remember what you said
about your answers?

368
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,541
Of course, they are right here.

369
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,791
Awesome, thanks a ton!

370
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,583
Though, I only grabbed these.

371
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,458
Kanji writing drills.

372
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,250
That's so not fair;
you tricked me!

373
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,916
[TAKAGI]
No, I didn't.

374
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:58,041
[laughs]

375
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:58,958
That's enough.

376
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,541
Let's work.

377
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:06,583
[NISHIKATA]
Wait.

378
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,541
If we're just practicing kanji,

379
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,000
was there ever any reason
to do our homework together?

380
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,666
[NISHKATA]
Oh no!

381
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,958
I saw this exact thing on
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i> !

382
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,208
[KYUNKO] Jeez. I don't
know why I have to make curry

383
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,958
with this jerk of all people!

384
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,416
He makes me so mad!

385
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,708
Um. You can let go
of my hand now.

386
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,750
Why would I want to do
something like that?

387
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:55,666
C'mere.

388
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,958
Let me see that face.

389
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,166
[KYUNKO]
Squeal!

390
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,875
[NISHIKATA]
I can't do that!

391
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,458
You can use it.

392
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,166
It is your eraser, after all.

393
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,041
That's my bad.

394
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,333
Uh. Okay.

395
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,250
[TAKAGI]
Your hand.

396
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,666
[NISHIKATA gasps]
Sorry!

397
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,291
You want somethin' to drink?

398
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:18,958
Like tea?

399
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:19,875
You want tea?

400
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,250
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hmm.

401
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,375
[NISHIKATA]
Comin' right up!

402
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,458
[TAKAGI]
Thanks for having me.

403
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,958
[NISHIKATA]
All she did was mess with me.

404
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,000
I think.

405
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:53,916
Bye!

406
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,666
I'll come again.

407
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:01,833
Huh?

408
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,958
She'll come again?

409
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,333
[NISHIKATA]
Maybe... I should clean my room.

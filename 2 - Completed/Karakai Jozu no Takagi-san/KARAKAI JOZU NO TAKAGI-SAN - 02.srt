"Calligraphy."

2
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,791
[TEACHER]
All right.

3
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,666
Now, we're
practicing calligraphy,

4
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,125
so write down your
favorite thing.

5
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,041
Due by the end of the day.

6
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,416
[KIMURA]
Well, I know what I'm writing.

7
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Grilled meat.

8
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,416
My favorite.

9
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,333
Having trouble deciding?

10
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,500
[NISHIKATA]
Sorta.

11
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,166
Did you figure out
what you're gonna write?

12
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,833
[TAKAGI]
Hmmm... Not just yet.

13
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,666
I know.

14
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,833
How about we both
write down something

15
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,958
that we want from each other?

16
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,000
What we want from each other?

17
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,250
Uh-huh.

18
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,125
[NISHIKATA]
Hmm...

19
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,458
Okay.

20
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,416
[NISHIKATA]
What I want from Takagi?

21
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,041
Hmm...

22
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,708
[NISHIKATA]
Duh!

23
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,333
For her to stop teasing me!

24
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,166
This'll be a good way
to tell her off!

25
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,333
[NISHIKATA]
Wait.

26
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,208
Now that I think about it,
that might actually backfire.

27
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,541
She'd probably call me a wuss
and make fun of me more.

28
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,125
I need to find a way
to make her sorry

29
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,958
without provoking her further.

30
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,291
This is harder
than it should be.

31
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,666
You done? Because I am.

32
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,541
Cool.

33
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,041
Let's show each other.

34
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,000
[NISHIKATA]
Howdya like this?

35
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,416
"Restraint"?

36
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,541
Uh, yeah.

37
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,791
With what?

38
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,250
I can't really help
if you don't specify.

39
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:21,416
Uh... Well, it's, uh,
a few different things.

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,666
She clearly doesn't get it.

41
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,666
But then again,
at this point if she did get it,

42
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,833
she'd probably get upset.

43
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,541
This is tricky.

44
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,166
So what about you?

45
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,291
What do you
mean by "status quo"?

46
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,916
[TAKAGI]
Oh, you don't get it?

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,250
Well, it means you're
easy to tease,

48
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,541
and I want you to
stay that way, 'kay?

49
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,833
[NISHIKATA] Red alert!
She's going on the offensive!

50
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,375
It's an ambush!

51
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,666
If that's how she
wants this to go, fine.

52
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,041
Two can play at that game.

53
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,958
I'm ready for it now.

54
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,583
Are you okay with a do-over?

55
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,333
Yeah, sure.

56
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,375
[NISHIKATA]
Get set to get wrecked, Takagi!

57
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,958
I'm about to
fight fire with fire!

58
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,375
[FEMALE STUDENT B]
So, did you finish?

59
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,875
[FEMALE STUDENT C]
Almost.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,958
[NISHIKATA chuckles]

61
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,333
This should make Takagi realize

62
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,500
that she isn't
exactly kind to me.

63
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,000
Can't misinterpret this!

64
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,833
Forget what I said before,
now I want to upset you!

65
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,500
Huh... What should I write?

66
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,250
[NISHIKATA]
Ho-ho what's this?

67
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,000
Having trouble coming up
with something?

68
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,583
Perhaps if you
were a bit kinder,

69
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,541
it'd be easy to come up with a
nice, wholesome request from me.

70
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,041
Oh. I wanted to
tell you earlier,

71
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,208
you have really
nice handwriting.

72
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,875
It has an interesting flare.

73
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,750
Have you been
taught calligraphy?

74
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,958
Uh, no, not really.

75
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,666
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

76
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,708
Well, either way,

77
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,666
I like it a lot.

78
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,625
Here.

79
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,833
[NISHIKATA]
Uh...

80
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,458
Thanks.

81
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,666
[NISHIKATA]
That's weird.

82
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,416
She's being so nice
all of a sudden.

83
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,083
What's going on?

84
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,791
[NISHIKATA]
Could it be?

85
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,958
Is Takagi actually nice,

86
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,250
and I just haven't
noticed it until now?

87
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,500
No way.

88
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,916
I'd have picked up on that.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,041
[gasps]

90
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,041
Nishikata, stay
still for a second.

91
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,291
Huh?!

92
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,333
Huh?

93
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,208
Got it.

94
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,166
Something was on your face.

95
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,375
Okay!

96
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,875
I think I have
something to write now.

97
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,458
[TAKAO] Do you like
my beautiful artwork?

98
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,666
[KIMURA] You're a weird
guy, you know that?

99
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,083
[SANAE]
What?

100
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,416
Okay.

101
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,458
I'm done.

102
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,750
How about you
show me yours first?

103
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,125
Uh... Why not
at the same time?

104
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,333
Just show me already.

105
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,625
Ahhh...

106
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:22,083
[NISHIKATA] I was a little more
obvious this time, at least.

107
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,208
You really do have
interesting handwriting.

108
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,958
That's all you
have to say? Come on.

109
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,375
I'm trying to
spell it out for you.

110
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,541
Stop teasing me.

111
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,041
What? I can't!

112
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,625
[NISHIKATA grunts] You didn't
even give it some thought.

113
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,041
All right, I'm sorry.

114
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,041
I'll hold back from now on.

115
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:38,833
Thank you.

116
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,500
So what's yours say?

117
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,625
Curious?

118
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,333
Then let's see.

119
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,625
Here.

120
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,666

121
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,916
[laughs]

122
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,958
[NISHIKATA]
When she touched my face.

123
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,708
Didn't you just say that you'd
hold back from now on?

124
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,500
Yeah, but I said that
after I already set this up.

125
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,541

[MINA moans]

128
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,166
So hot.

129
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,333
Yeah, I guess so.

130
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,541
[MINA] We should start wearing
our short-sleeve uniform soon.

131
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,583
Yeah. I guess so.

132
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,083
Let's just tell Sanae

133
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,291
that we're gonna start wearing
them tomorrow, sound good?

134
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,708
[YUKARI]
Yeah, I guess so.

[SANAE]
You guess what?

136
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,458
Huh?

137
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,291
Hey.

138
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,666
[SANAE]
Long sleeves?

139
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,583
Aren't you hot?

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,541
[SANAE]
What?

141
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,541
We said that we'd all change
our uniforms at the same time!

00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,291
Come on!

143
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,750
Wait, we did?

144
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:26,875
Yes, we did!

145
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,875
You forgot?

146
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,583
[SANAE]
Hmm?

147
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,916
Yeah.

148
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:43,916
Ahhhh! It's a lot cooler wearing
short sleeves, isn't it?

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,250
Yeah, I guess so.

150
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,125
[SANAE]
Hey.

151
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,833

[MINA]
Hey, Sanae.

153
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,416
Good mor... ning.

00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,125
[SANAE]
I thought you said

155
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,583
we were all gonna change
our uniforms together?

I guess I forgot to tell you.

162
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,000
"That's right. Walk down this
street to the post office

163
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,041
and turn left there."

164
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,000
You will see the station.

165
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,833
It takes five minutes from here.

166
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,583
[NISHIKATA] Somehow I have
to get back at Takagi today.

167
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,791
But the ever-present
question is: How?

168
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,958
[NISHIKATA] I haven't made
a jack-in-the-box in a while.

169
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,291
No, I don't have
enough materials.

170
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,166
At this point, I wouldn't
finish in time, anyway.

171
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,333
Uhh.

172
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,666
Let's see, who should
I put on the spot?

173
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,875
Nishikata.

174
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:01,791
Huh?

175
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,541
Uhh.

176
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,500
Yes, sir!

177
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,291
Don't "Huh? Yes, sir!" me.

178
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,916
Hurry up.

179
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,750
Don't worry, it's 16.

180
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,500

00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,416
You don't even know
what class you're in, kid?

183
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,916
It's English, not Math!

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,541
I told you to read aloud!

185
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,458
Uh... I'm sorry, sir.

186
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,541
[TANABE]
Forget it. Sit down.

187
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,541
I told you we were on line 16.

188
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,458
Way to drop the ball there.

189
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,458
[NISHIKATA] Yeah, right,
you were intentionally vague,

190
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,541
so I'd mess it up.

191
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,750
Really.

192
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,541
I didn't think you'd
actually mess that up.

193
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,583
[NISHIKATA]
Called it.

194
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,916
[TAKAGI laughs]

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,125
What's wrong?

196
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,666
Are you preoccupied
with something?

197
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,708
You could say that.

198
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,916
Mind if I ask what it is?

199
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,500
Ehh.

200
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,500
It's really not
worth mentioning.

201
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,750
Huuuuh...

202
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,125
[TAKAGI]
Then...

203
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,166
Were you thinking about
something naughty?

204
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,208
Wha...?!

205
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,083
No way! Of course not!

206
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:09,958
[TAKAGI]
Really?

207
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:10,666
[NISHIKATA]
I would never!

208
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,875
Not in a million years!

209
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,000
What kinda guy
do ya' think I am?!

210
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,166
I know. I know.

211
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,375
You were just trying to think
of new way to get back at me

212
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,958
for all the teasing I do, right?

213
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,041
Nuh-uh.

214
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,791
No idea what you mean.

215
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,500
I know I'm right.

216
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,541
You were looking
at me earlier, so...

217
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,416
...it wasn't that
hard to figure out.

218
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,583
[NISHIKATA] If you already
knew, then why'd you ask?

219
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,291
'Cus it's fun to see how
you react when I mess with you.

220
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,375
So what?

221
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,416
Did you come up
with a good idea?

222
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,916
[NISHIKATA]
Hmph!

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,250
Yup, sure did.

224
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,791
You see, I came up
with the perfect plan.

225
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,416
Oh and this time
it's absolutely foolproof.

226
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,708
So...

227
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,833
[TAKAGI]
Hmm...

228
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,583
I'll believe it when I see it.

229
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,166
[NISHIKATA]
She's not worried at all.

230
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,541
It's like she can read my mind,

231
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,500
so she knows
I don't have a plan!

232
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,541
Spill it.

233
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,166
What's this plan of yours?

234
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,416
What idiot would tell you that?

235
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh fine, how about just a hint?

236
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,250
I'm not telling you!

237
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,000
Just pay attention.

238
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,041
[gasps]

239
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,166
Wait, today's the eighteenth.

240
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,458
The teachers
always call on the kid

241
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,208
whose student number
matches the date.

242
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,041
And today that's Takagi!

243
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,625
If I can get her attention
away from class,

244
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,541
she might get in trouble
for not knowing

245
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,875
where we are in the textbook!

246
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,250
Hey, Takagi?

247
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,708
D'you eat breakfast today?

248
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,166
Whadja have?

249
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,333
Yeah, mountain yam over rice.

250
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,708
Why ask?

251
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,875
Ehh.

252
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,583
Just curious.

253
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,333
So you like mountain yams?

254
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,916
[TAKAGI]
Yeah, I like 'em.

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,041
I usually have energy all day
when I eat them in the morning.

256
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:44,833
Huh.

257
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,958
Yeah, I kinda getcha.

258
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,250
What'd you eat?

259
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,250
Me?

260
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,583
Uh, I had...

261
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,916
Bet you can't guess.

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,625
[TAKAGI]
Hmm, I wonder.

263
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,125
Rice?

264
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,041
Rice? Why's that?

265
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,208
Well, I didn't peg
you as a toast kinda guy.

266
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,166
Am I wrong?

267
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,333
No. You're right, I had rice.

268
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,500
It's working!

269
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,833
Just keep her attention
off of the lesson!

270
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,416
So uhh... you on team rice?

271
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,916
I want someone to read
the next page aloud.

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,833
Today's the eighteenth,
so how about Takagi.

273
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,083
[NISHIKATA]
Here we go! Heh heh heh.

274
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,208
[NISHIKATA] You don't
know where we are, do you?

275
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,916
Do you?

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,458
"I will not do such a thing."

277
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,125
[TANABE]
Thank you. Very nice.

278
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,333
[NISHIKATA]
What?

279
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,666
[TAKAGI]
Hmph.

280
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,083
[TAKAGI]
Nice try.

281
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,750
[NISHIKATA]
Wh-What are you talking about?

282
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,416
[NISHIKATA]
Man, she's good!

283
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,000
I can never seem to get her!

284
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,916
Gotta come up with another plan.

285
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,250
Maybe I can take it
back to basics

286
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,833
and hit her with the
old jack-in-the-box?

287
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,541
No, I don't have the materials!

288
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,333
Been over this!

289
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,333
Okay.

290
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,708
What is it this time?

291
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,750
Uh? It's, uhh...

292
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,916
Nothing, forget it.

293
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,416
By any chance, were you
thinking about me again?

294
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,833
No, not really.

295
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,708
Not in so many words.

296
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,916
Plus, why would
I think about you?

297
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
That'd be weird, wouldn't it?

298
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,708
[TAKAGI] Oooh, then you were
thinking something naughty.

299
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,208
No! I swear!

300
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,583
[laughs]

301
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,041
I know.

302
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,083
I'm always thinking
about you, though.

303
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,791
Hey, you're blushing!

304
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,708
[NISHIKATA]
No I'm not.

305
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,250
And gimme a break.

306
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,083
You're just always thinking
about different ways

307
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,458
to tease me, aren't you?

308
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,541
Eh...

309
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,458
[NISHIKATA] Why did she
take so long to answer?

310
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,916
[TANABE]
Today's June eighteenth.

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,791
If I add the month
and date together, it's 24.

312
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,875
Number 24!

313
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,666
Nishikata!

314
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,333
[NISHIKATA]
"Pool."

315
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,000
It's the first day
we get to go in the pool,

316
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,291
but all I can do is watch.

317
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,125
Why'd I have to hurt my hand?

318
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,375
[NISHIKATA]
It's just not fair.

319
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,500
They're all having fun
without me.

320
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,958
Right?

321
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,750
And of course this happens

322
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,375
on the first day that
they let us swim.

323
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,500
It sucks!

324
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,875
So you're sitting
out too, I take it?

325
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,750
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hmm.

326
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,291
For you it's because
of your hand, yeah?

327
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,750
How'd you hurt it?

328
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,041
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah.

329
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,708
Well, you know, things happen.

330
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,916
I bet you tried to pet a cat,
but then it bit you.

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,125
Huh?! Wait,
how did you know that?

332
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,166
I made an effort not
to tell anyone!

333
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,916
[TAKAGI laughs]
I'm actually right?

334
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,041
I just took a shot in the dark!

335
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,416
You are something else!

336
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,833
[laughs]

337
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,541
So what's your excuse?

338
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,958
Why are you just watching
everyone swim... today?

339
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,625
That reminds me.

340
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,708
Any girl who sits out
during swimming

341
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,500
is usually on her period.

342
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,625
According to the textbook,

343
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,458
it causes abdominal pain
and discomfort.

344
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,458
[NISHIKATA] So says Takao,
the King of Health Class.

345
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,625
Oh, uh, it's nothing, forget it.

346
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,833
I shouldn't ask.

347
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,458
It's not really any of
my business anyway.

348
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,291
[TAKAGI] You wanted to ask
why I'm not swimming today,

349
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,333
didn't you?

350
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,875
[NISHIKATA]
Of course she heard me.

351
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,125
Oh. Hey. How about
because I figured out

352
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,375
your reason is your hand,

353
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,375
you take a shot at
guessing my reason?

354
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,416
[NISHIKATA]
You're not feeling good?

355
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,625
[TAKAGI] You have to be
more specific than that.

356
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,458
[NISHIKATA]
No. Forget it.

357
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,708
I wasn't actually gonna ask you.

358
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,583
Oh?

359
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,583
Then are you admitting defeat?

360
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,458
All right, fine.

361
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,125
I might as well take a guess.

362
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,583
Only one, though.

363
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,416
Well, not that you'd
get it with more tries.

364
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,250
[NISHIKATA]
She's got me cornered now.

365
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,375
Is she this confident because
she thinks I can't say "period"?

366
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,833
Because if that's it,
I'll show her!

367
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,083
I'll say it ten times!

368
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,833
But wait, this is
Takagi we're talking about.

369
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,333
It could be a trap!

370
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,666
Even if I gathered my courage
and answered, "Period"!

371
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,541
I know what'll happen!

372
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,791
No, and that's very rude of you!

373
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,875
[NISHIKATA groans]

374
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,125
[NISHIKATA]
So that's out of the question.

375
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,333
But knowing her,
she probably already has an idea

376
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,875
of what's going through my head.

377
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,583
I'm hesitating, that's enough
for her to figure it out.

378
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,750
But if I don't answer at all,

379
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,458
well, I think I know
how that'll go, too.

380
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,041
You don't even know the
reason why a girl is sitting out

381
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,666
when she could be swimming?

382
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,083
Ha! That means I win, then.

383
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,625
[NISHIKATA]
Is this a trap or not?

384
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,000
Is she making it seem genuine
so I'll fall into a trap?

385
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,583
Or is she making it seem like a
trap, so I'll worry and mess up?

386
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,000
Agh. I'm just going
around in circles here!

387
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,125
This sucks.

388
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,583
What was with that face before?

389
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,083
And was she gripping
her stomach or what?

390
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,500
Okay, what else could it be?

391
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,541
Maybe an injury?

392
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,500
[NISHIKATA] I don't know;
it doesn't seem like it.

393
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,125
It doesn't really look like
she's feeling too sick

394
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,625
to be exercising either.

395
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,416
Then that leaves.

396
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,791
What's left?

397
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,791
No.

398
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,916
[NISHIKATA] They don't know
how good they have it.

399
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,583
They get to goof around
and cool off in the pool.

400
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,708
Meanwhile I'm here in the
heat using all my brain power

401
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,291
to battle Takagi.

402
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,958
Come on, Nishikata,
we don't have all day.

403
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,500
You're not just
checking out all the girls

404
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,416
in their swimsuits, are you?

405
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,125
What? Of course I'm not!

406
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,375
Are you sure about that?

407
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,750
Because you know what I heard?

408
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,250
Boys are ususally
looking at girls' chests.

409
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,333
Whatever, then
I'm the exception!

410
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,333
[NISHIKATA]
I could never say this out loud.

411
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:22,208
But Takagi doesn't
have a very big chest.

412
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,125
I heard that
small-chested girls are...

413
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,375
...sensitive about it.

414
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,500
So you probs
shouldn't bring it up.

415
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,666
[NISHIKATA] So says Kimura,
the King of Early Lunch.

416
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,083
Could it be that
she's not swimming

417
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,750
because she has some sort
of complex about her body?

418
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,916
Like, she's self-conscious?

419
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,208
I had a feeling you
wouldn't figure it out.

420
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,541
That means I win today, too.

421
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,041
Oh, Takagi.

422
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,250
I do know why.

423
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:50,041
It's obvious that you're just
self-conscious about your chest!

424
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,833
[NISHIKATA]
Ugh! Yeah, right!

425
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,000
Like I could ever say that!

426
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,125
It's beyond rude!
It's super rude!

427
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,541
The only answer I have left
is that she's on her period!

428
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,958
But that's plenty rude, too.

429
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,500
What do I do?

430
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,291
You're still thinking it over?

431
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,041
We have to go back inside soon.

432
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:07,916
[NISHIKATA]
No!

433
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,083
They even say in the textbook

434
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,041
that it's nothing to be
embarrassed about!

435
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,291
It'll be fine!

436
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,333
You got this.

437
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,875
Just say it with
your head held high!

438
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,666
It's now or never!

439
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:20,208
[NISHIKATA] The reason you're
sitting out in swim class is...

440
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,208
...you're on your period.

441
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,625
[TAKAGI]
Incorrect.

442
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,250
[TAKAGI] And that's
pretty rude to say to a girl.

443
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,375
Uh! I just thought that
since it was mentioned

444
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,375
in our health
textbook, it might--

445
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,875
[laughs]

446
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,125
Man Nishikata,
your face is bright red!

447
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,208
[NISHIKATA]
Then is it actually

448
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,291
because she's self-conscious
about her chest?

449
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,541
That's all I got!

450
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,875
Ahhh... Too funny.

451
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,041
Upsy-daisy.

452
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,041
And for the record.

453
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,291
Being too self-conscious
about my chest...

454
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,708
...is also incorrect.

455
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,500
[NISHIKATA]
Wha...?!

456
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,250
[TAKAGI]
Excuse me!

457
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,916
I changed my mind,
is it okay if I swim?

458
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,541
[SWIM TEACHER]
That's fine!

459
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,083
[NISHIKATA]
Uh... I don't get it.

460
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,333
Then why was she sitting out?

461
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,541
Okay.

462
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,208
Now that I've gotten
my fill of funny faces.

463
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,250
It's time for a quick swim.

464
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,166
Oh, don't tell me you were
sitting out that whole time

465
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,875
just so you could tease me more!

466
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,000
Hey. When your hand heals...

467
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,416
...then we can swim together.

468
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,625
[TAKAGI]
It's cold!

469
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,291
[NISHIKATA]
I won't fall for it.

470
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,625
When we do swim together,

471
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,000
I'd bet anything she's
gonna mess with me again.

472
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,833
After all, that's the
kind of person she is.

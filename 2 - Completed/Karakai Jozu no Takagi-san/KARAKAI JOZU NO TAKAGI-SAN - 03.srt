1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,500
[MINA]
"Coffee."

2
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,041
Ugh. Bitter.

3
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,875
What's goin' on with your face?

4
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,166
Ugh.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,916
Huh? Wait. Isn't that coffee?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,833
I thought you
hated the stuff, Mina.

7
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,333
Why would you
buy it i you hate it?

8
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,250
Well, I'm becoming
more of an adult now,

9
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,291
so I thought I should try
to get myself used to it.

10
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,625
Huh?

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,916
How exactly are
you more of adult now?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,958
Ah! Hey, I may not be tall,
but I'm growing in some ways!

13
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,041
I'd like to see
you drink this, Sanae!

14
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,291
No problem.

15
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,500
I like it black.

16
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,750
Huh?

17
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,958
You like it black?

18
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,833
[gasps]

19
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,333
Do you wanna
trade with me, then?

20
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,416
[gasps]

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,583
I do. But I'm an adult, so...

22
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,875
Three, two, one--

23
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,791
[MINA]
Okay, whatever, let's trade!

24
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,416
Yes!

25
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,250
Ahhh... So good.

26
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,958
You sure you're okay with this?

27
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,333
Yeah.

28
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,125
There's gotta be some adults
who can't drink coffee.

29
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,083
You know you're a kid right?

30
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,000
[gasps]

31
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,375
Why're you so mean?

32
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,333
Ahh!

33
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,958
Ahhh! Ow!

34
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,416
Oh great.

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,250
Adults don't try to tackle
their friends, Mina.

36
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,541
[NISHIKATA]
As I've come to expect,

37
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:25,083
Takagi made fun
of me a ton today.

38
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,750
[groans]

39
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,083
[NISHIKATA]
But I'll get her tomorrow!

40
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,625
[TAKAGI]
Nishikata.

41
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,500
[NISHIKATA]
Takagi!

42
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,041
Oh.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,958
On your own today?

44
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:44,875
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah.

45
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,958
Cool. Let's walk home together.

46
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,500
Uh. Wait, why?

47
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:51,500
[TAKAGI]
What?

48
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,583
Um, sorry.

49
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,333
I thought I heard something.

50
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,041
But, um, you're
on your bike, and all.

51
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,708
[TAKAGI]
I'll just push.

52
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,750
[NISHIKATA]
"Empty Can."

53
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,958
That's that new drink
that just came out, isn't it?

54
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,833
Is it good?

55
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,416
[NISHIKATA]
What is this?

56
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,375
Some kind of trap?

57
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,833
I like it.

58
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,458
You wanna have a sip?

59
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,333
Can I?

60
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,416
[NISHIKATA]
Mm-hmm.

61
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,250
Great. Thank you.

62
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,583
Not that I really mind,

63
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:32,166
but won't it be like we're
indirectly kissing or something?

64
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,000
[NISHIKATA]
How's that, Takagi?

65
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,291
Super embarrassing, right?

66
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,000
You're so embarrassed!

67
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,625
Wha...? How?

68
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,458
She's not embarrassed
in the slightest!

69
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,083
What is with her?

70
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,333
Ahh...

71
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,750
Boy, that was good.

72
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,458
Thanks again.

73
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,916
Can't drink it?

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,750
No. Of course I can drink it.

75
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,416
[NISHIKATA]
It's nothing.

76
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,458
No big deal.

77
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,791
It's like an indirect kiss.

78
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,291
Aah!

79
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,333
[TAKAGI laughs]
You're so jumpy.

80
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:26,333
[NISHIKATA] There's gotta
be a trash can around here.

81
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,958
Man!

82
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,125
Wow!

83
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,791
That was a pretty
good shot, Nishikata.

84
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,583
[NISHIKATA] I just threw
it without thinking.

85
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,000
I didn't expect to make it in.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
[NISHIKATA]
This is crazy!

87
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,750
I didn't know
I was such a good shot!

88
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:51,791
All right.

89
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,916
I wanna give this a go.

90
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:04,166
[laughs]

91
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,833
What are you aiming at?

92
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,000
You weren't even close!

93
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,500
You're terrible at this!

94
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,333
Oh? Care to make it interesting?

95
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,291
[laughs]
Yeah, fine.

96
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,750
I can't say "no" when
winning's a sure-thing.

97
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,125
[TAKAGI] Then, we'll each
throw one can at a time.

98
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,916
The first person
to make it in, wins.

99
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,750
[NISHIKATA] Challenging me to
a match she can't possibly win.

100
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,541
Takagi's really
lost her cool this time.

101
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,208
And it feels awesome!

102
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,625
So if you somehow win,

103
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,291
then I guess I'll do
anything you want me to.

104
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,333
I'm gonna hold you to that.

105
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,375
You better not
chicken out later.

106
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,708
No way.

107
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,958
Besides, it's not like
I'm gonna lose to you.

108
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,000
Glad to hear it.

109
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,125
[gasps]

110
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,416
[laughs]

111
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,916
If you miss, that means I win.

112
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:02,833
[NISHIKATA]
Ugh.

113
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:06,250
She totally tricked me again.

114
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,333
[NISHIKATA]
Just stand at the same place

115
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,166
and use the same angle.

116
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,916
Okay.

117
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,458
[NISHIKATA]
I can do this.

118
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,625
It's a walk in the park!

119
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:19,958
Oh, yeah.

120
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,625
So, uh, if you happen to win,

121
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,750
then I'll let you
have my first kiss.

122
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,208
[moans]

123
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,708
[TAKAGI laughs]

124
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,125
Looks like I win!

125
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,625
[NISHIKATA]
That wasn't fair.

126
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,458
What wasn't?

127
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,916
Whaddya mean "what wasn't"?

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,583
As I threw it, you said--

129
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,666
[TAKAGI]
Hmm? Said what?

130
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,333
Oh, forget it.

131
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,208
[TAKAGI]
Okay.

132
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,708
Well, a promise is a promise.

133
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,625
Now what should I make you do?

134
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,250
[NISHIKATA] I don't even want to
think about what she might say.

135
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,083
[TAKAGI]
Know what?

136
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,625
How about this?

137
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,666
You can do whatever.

138
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,000
Wait, where are
you going Takagi?!

139
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:16,750
Don't pity me!

140
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,208
I need consequences!

141
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,625
Letting me off like
this makes me feel like

142
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,875
I'll never beat
you at anything.

143
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,875
[TAKAGI] You never
will beat me at anything.

144
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,708
[NISHIKATA] Huh?
What's that supposed to mean?

145
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,083
Hey!

146
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,666
[MINA]
"Soda."

147
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,291
Ahh!

148
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,958
So fizzy.

149
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,375
What is it this time?

150
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,750
[YUKARI] Huh?
You're drinking soda?

151
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,583
I thought you didn't
like soda, though.

152
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,666
Why do sodas
have to be so fizzy?

153
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,833
It stings!

154
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,375
Is there a reason you
keep buying drinks

155
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,791
you don't even like?

156
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,041
Pretending to be an adult again?

157
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,375
No, not that.

158
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,541
I just love the flavor.

159
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,750
[screams]

160
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,583
But it stings bad!

161
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,791
My poor tongue
is hurting so bad!

162
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,125
You're so annoying.

163
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,291
What?

164
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,375
Don't act like it
doesn't hurt your tongue

165
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,708
when you have this stuff!

166
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,750
It doesn't.

167
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,666
Prove it. Have some right now.

168
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,625
All right.

169
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,333
Ahh!

170
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,291
The pain'll bubble
up inside you soon.

171
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,208
Yeah, not likely.

172
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:26,750
Tell the truth.

173
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,250
You're feeling it, aren't you?

174
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,000
No, I'm not.

175
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,291
[MINA]
Hmm...

176
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,000
[YUKARI]
What pain is she talking about?

177
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,375
I'm fine.

178
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,541
Oh no.

179
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,375
I'm about to burp.

180
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,791
Ha! You feelin' it now?

181
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,125
[YUKARI]
Nuh-uh.

182
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,875
If I burp right now,
she's gonna make fun of me.

183
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,750
[YUKARI] But this stupid
fizz is still coming up.

184
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:57,250
I can't hold it much longer!

185
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,416
Agh! It's so tingly, I hate it!

186
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,166
Ahhh...

187
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,666
What's your problem?

188
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,291
Nothing.

189
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:16,125
[MINA]
Why am I still drinking this?

190
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,250
[TAKAGI laughs]

191
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,958
See you tomorrow!

192
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,083
[NISHIKATA grunts]
Just you wait, Takagi.

193
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,166
Including the walk home,

194
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,291
she teased me 15
times in total today.

195
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,458
[TV TRAINER] Each time I make
a mistake during a game,

196
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,916
I make a note of it.

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,708
Then I train ten times
harder for each one.

198
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,625
I believe that will lead me
to my next victory.

199
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,833
[NISHIKATA]
That's it!

200
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,208
Today I had 15 losses.

201
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,375
And that times ten is 150!

202
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,708
Uh... That might be
too much for my first go.

203
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,708
Okay.

204
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,041
Let's try three times first.

205
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,791
One, two, three.

206
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,041
Eighteen.

207
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,750
Nineteen.

208
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,041
[NISHIKATA] This is a
lot harder than I thought!

209
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,125
Maybe I shouldn't do so many.

210
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,458
No, I have to!

211
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,416
This is my punishment
for letting Takagi mess

212
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,583
with me so many times!

213
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,041
[NISHIKATA]
I'll savor this agony

214
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:35,208
and use it as motivation
to get back at her next time!

215
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,125
I can do this!

216
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,291
[NISHIKATA]
"Muscle Training."

217
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,208
What's wrong?

218
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,458
Is your arm hurt?

219
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,500
Pull a muscle?

220
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,291
Huh? Oh, no,
it's nothing like that.

221
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,500
It's just extra sore is all.

222
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,875
Huh?

223
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,416
[shrieks]

224
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,875
I just said it was sore!

225
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,916
That really hurts!

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,666
Does that count as
her first teasing of the day?

227
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,583
I should probably be
holding myself accountable.

228
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,416
So I guess that's one.

229
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,916
Hey!

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,416
[laughs]

231
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,041
That was way too easy!

232
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,041
You must be really sore
if flinching hurts.

233
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,791
Okay, well that
was definitely teasing,

234
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,791
no doubt about it.

235
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,791
So... wanna tell me why
you're sore all of a sudden?

236
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,791
Uhh. I started to work out
yesterday, so you know.

237
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,041
Interesting.

238
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,041
I hope you don't quit
after like, three days.

239
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,541
[NISHIKATA]
Hah. Go ahead.

240
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,750
Laugh it up now.

241
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,458
[NISHIKATA]
Why?

242
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,500
She teased me 23 times today!

243
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,083
Is that a record?

244
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,166
Either way, it's much
more than yesterday!

245
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:49,125
[NISHIKATA]
One, two, three.

246
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,208
[TAKAGI] Hey, whatever happened
to working out, Nishikata?

247
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,000
[NISHIKATA]
Nothing, I still do it daily.

248
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,291
Oh wow.

249
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,083
So you didn't
quit three days in?

250
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,625
Yes, thanks to you.

251
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,458
Oh! But you know what I heard?

252
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,000
Huh? No, what?

253
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,166
They say if you work out too
much during your growth spurt,

254
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,708
it'll stop you
from getting taller.

255
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,291
Uh, wait?

256
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,583
Huh?! Oh no!

257
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,708
I think I did hear that
somewhere before!

258
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,125
That's not good!

259
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,916
If she ends ups taller than
me because I'm stunting

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,666
my own growth,
I'll never heard the end of it!

261
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,208
She'll make fun of me forever!

262
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,583
What do I do, what do I do?

263
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,166
But that is just a rumor.

264
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,041
Just a rumor?

265
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,250
In fact, I've also heard
moderate exercise

266
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,125
actually supports your growth.

267
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,000
So, that being the case,
you should keep working out.

268
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,875
Nothing to worry about.

269
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,291
It's a good idea.

270
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,416
And to be honest,

271
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,875
you kinda look
a bit more muscular.

272
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,458
[NISHIKATA]
You think?

273
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,875
What's wrong?

274
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,583
You're quiet.

275
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,166
Don't tell me
that you're blushing.

276
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,875
I'm not blushing.

277
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,958
But your face is red.

278
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,166
[laughs]

279
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,708
Yeah, you're definitely
blushing all right.

280
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,458
Why do you always have
to tease me every single day?

281
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,375
Because I like seeing
your reactions, duh.

282
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,666
By the way,

283
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,708
I wasn't lying when
I said you look muscular.

284
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,833
Honestly, you've
looked pretty good lately.

285
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,666
[laughs]

286
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,125
You're even redder now!

287
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,833
Whatever! It's just
because it's hot outside!

288
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:25,583
Hey!

289
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,500
Takagi!

290
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,958
Come back!

291
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,333
The count is 54 today.

292
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,250
Oh, 55 including this last one.

293
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,708
But I'm starting to think that
I should keep working out

294
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,500
even if Takagi doesn't tease me.

296
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,541
[SANAE] Chester dear, are you
eating dinner at home tonight?

297
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,916
[MINA] Well, I reckon'
that depends on work.

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,375
If we go too late, I'll just eat
with Jirou on my way home.

299
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,416
[SANAE] I'm glad you've
found a close friend in Jirou,

300
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,208
but you should have
dinner at home sometimes.

301
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,291
It's starting to
feel lonely without you.

302
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,416
[MINA] Yeah, but it's mah job,
what can yah do?

304
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,583
Can we please just go home?

305
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,625
No way! We're havin' fun!

306
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,083
[YUKARI] Why are you
still talking like that?

307
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,166
So annoying.

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,000
Uh...

You jerk!

310
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,708
Am I really so
unimportant to you?

311
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,208
[MINA] Aww, Puddin',
don't be like that.

312
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,333

Why are you cryin' mah darlin'?

315
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,333
Well, it's as if Jirou

316

and your work have taken
you away from me.

317
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,625
I just...

318
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,666
I don't think
I can take it any longer.

say such a thing, Chester? Oh!

322
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,375

333
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,250
Aww! Of course it starts
raining right when school ends.

334
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,000
Huh?! No one told me it
was gonna rain today!

335
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,416
If I knew, I would
have brought my raincoat!

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,333
Hey, don't be so mean to Mina.

338
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,875
You want to take
the bus home, then?

339
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,250
[MINA] I don't have
any bus money either.

340
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,041
See what I mean, dumb.

341
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,666
Oh, you be quiet.

342
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,791
I'll lend you some cash,
don't worry.

343
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,333
[NISHIKATA]
Man.

344
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,125
I got teased a ton today, too.

345
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,625
Huh? Aren't you
heading home, Takagi?

346
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,791
Not yet.

347
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,833
I didn't bring a raincoat
or an umbrella.

348
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,500
[laughs]

349
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,125
[NISHIKATA]
You are such an airhead!

350
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,458
You really didn't know it
was gonna rain today?

351
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,791
How ditzy can you be?

352
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,000
[NISHIKATA]
No comeback?

353
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,500
[TAKAGI]
Oh.

354
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,458
Come to think of it, your
umbrella is pretty big, right?

355
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,791
Huh?

356
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:16,875
[NISHIKATA]
We look like a couple

357
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,708
under this umbrella together.

How in the world
did this happen?

359
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,708
I feel so weird!

360
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,583
It's super awkward!

361
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,083
What should I do?

362
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,708
Fill the silence, I guess.

363
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,541
So, uh, what about your bike?

364
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,291
It's still at school,
but I'll walk tomorrow.

365
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,458
Oh. Okay.

366
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,375
[NISHIKATA]
It's even more awkward now

367
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,833
that I tried
to fill the silence,

368
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,791
and it worked for
all of five seconds!

369
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,041
Ugh. I'm so embarrassed that
it's getting hard to breathe.

370
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,750
I need to distract
myself somehow.

371
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,416
Hey, Takagi!

372
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,666
[NISHIKATA]
How's this?

373
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,666
Are you scared?

374
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,291
Surprised?

375
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,333
Give me something!

376
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,041
Aww. He's so cute!

377
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,833
[NISHIKATA]
Excuse me?

378
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,708
Ugh, what was I thinking?

379
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:14,333
This is Takagi I'm dealing with,
of course she's fine!

380
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,000
Wait, what?

381
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,625
[shrieks]

382
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,125
[laughs]

383
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,083
Don't freak, it's just a frog.

384
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:26,166
[laughs]

385
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,958
By the way, Nishikata.

386
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,958
Is your shoulder
getting wet over there?

387
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,083
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah, sort of.

388
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,666
It's not that bad, though.

389
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,916
[TAKAGI] Getting wet
at all can lead to a cold.

390
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,166
I'm gonna scoot closer,

391
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,791
so get yourself all the
way under the umbrella.

392
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,458
[NISHIKATA]
My heart's pounding so fast.

393
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,375
It feels like
it's about to burst!

394
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,916
Calm down, calm down, Nishikata!

395
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,125
If she finds out you're nervous,

396
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,666
she's gonna make
fun of you again!

397
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,416
Just talk about something.

398
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,791
Anything!

399
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,291
So hey, uh...

400
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,666
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

401
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,333
It's pretty unusual for you
to forget your umbrella

402
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,791
when it's supposed to rain.

403
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,541
Could it be that you
really are an airhead,

404
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,708
and I was right all along?

405
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,500
[NISHIKATA]
Was that too harsh?

406
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,375
[TAKAGI]
Hmmm...

407
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,750
Yeah, maybe.

408
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,791
I do tend to be
sort of forgetful.

409
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,041
[NISHIKATA]
Did I hear that right?

410
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,500
Did she just admit
she has a fault?

411
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,541
What a rare occasion!

412
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,541
I feel like I've won for once!

413
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,208
I'm having trouble remembering
something right now, actually.

414
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,291
Oh, yeah?

415
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,666
Do you need help?

416
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,083
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hmm.

417
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,125
The two of us, all close,
sharing the same umbrella.

418
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,958
We must look like a...

419
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,416
What was the word for it?

420
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,708
I just can't seem
to remember it.

421
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,666
Uhh.

422
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,708
Wait, you don't mean...

423
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,291
It's on the tip of my tongue!

424
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,625
Uh... We look like a couple?

425
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,583
Huh? What was that?

426
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,375
I didn't quite hear you.

427
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,750
Oh, I remember!

428
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,250
It was "couple"!

429
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,833
Come on, there's
no way you forgot that!

430
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,708
Oh, what about that
thing that couples do?

431
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,833
You know.

432
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,916
It's a way they
express their love.

433
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,125
When they take their lips

434
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,250
and then press them up
against each other?

435
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,708
[NISHIKATA] If I don't
answer her, then I lose!

436
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,208
A... A kiss?

437
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,166
Huh? I can't hear you,
the rain's too loud.

438
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,166
What do you mean?

439
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,083
It's not raining
that hard anymore.

440
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,125
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

441
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,666
So don't pretend
you didn't hear me.

442
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,333
I said it's a kiss.

443
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,250
Ahh. That was it.

444
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,791
So how about that
phrase they always use

445
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,500
to show their feelings?

446
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,333
Know that?

447
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,166
You know.

448
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,041
That one.

449
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,791
Not I "like" you, but...

450
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,791
Pretty sure
it starts out the same.

451
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,625
"I" something.

452
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,666
Uh, I dunno.

453
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,333
[TAKAGI] I think the next
word starts with "L," too.

454
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,250
[NISHIKATA]
I said I don't know!

455
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,458
Nah, you know this one.

456
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,041
"I"...

457
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,708
The next word starts with "L-O."

458
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:26,166
"I lo"...
What's the next letter?

459
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,708
You know it.

460
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,291
Th-That's enough.

461
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,250
Oh! The last word is "you."

462
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,083
You're not gonna
let up, are you?

463
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,416
Ugh, man!

464
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,625
Hey, check it out,
the rain stopped!

465
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,750
Yeah, you're right.

466
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,000
[NISHIKATA]
I'm saved!

467
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,583
There was no way
I could survive that treatment

468
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,750
until we reached her house!

469
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,625
Well, my place is this way.

470
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,500
Now that the skies are clear,
I'll be going.

471
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,833
Where are we?

472
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,333
I don't know how
to get home from here.

473
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,416
Ugh!

474
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,375
Will you ever give me a break?

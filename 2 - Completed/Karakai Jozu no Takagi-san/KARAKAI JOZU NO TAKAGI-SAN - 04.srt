1
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,125
[TANABE]
All right, buddy,

2
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:14,458
I'm sure you know,

3
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,625
but you've been way too
loud during class lately.

4
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,875
I expect you to shape up.

5
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,000
Uh. Yes, sir.

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,916
Sorry about that 

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,125
[TANABE]
So I'm putting you in charge

8
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,000
of cleaning the
science room after school.

9
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,375
Huh?

10
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,875
[TANABE] Don't forget to
wipe the desks down, too.

11
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,250
[NISHIKATA]
Huh?!

12
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,416
[NISHIKATA]
"Cleaning Duty."

13
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,125
[NISHIKATA sighs]

14
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,500
It's not fair that it's just me.

15
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,583
Takagi should be
getting punished, too.

16
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:19,208
She's the one who's always
teasing me during class.

17
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,000
[sighs]

18
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:24,208
But I guess the problem is
that my reactions are too loud.

19
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,458
Let's just get this
over with and head--

20
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,958
[screams]

21
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,291
What are you doing
hiding in the closet?

22
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,833
[laughs]

23
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,166
I was trying to scare you.

24
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,791
Ahh...

25
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,250
That was so worth having
to waste time in there.

26
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,625
Wait.

27
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,333
Lemme guess, you have
to clean as punishment, too?

28
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,583
Why don't we
just get it over with?

29
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,500
Okay?

30
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,750
So, I have a proposal for you.

31
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,125
Before we start,

32
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,583
let's make a game out of
cleaning, so it's more fun.

33
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,791
A game?

34
00:02:58,875 --> 00:02:59,833
[TAKAGI]
Yep.

35
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,500
How about we do
rock-paper-scissors,

36
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,250
and the loser has to clean
a quarter of the room?

37
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,333
You in?

38
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,333
[gasps]

39
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,333
[NISHIKATA]
Hold on.

40
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,750
That means
if I win all four times,

41
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,500
I won't have to clean anything!

42
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,791
[NISHKATA]
Heh! Sure.

43
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,541
[TAKAGI]
All right, let's get started.

44
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,500
Round one!

45
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,708
I'll use rock.

46
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,000
[NISHIKATA gasps]

47
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,041
Why's she telling me what
she's gonna choose?

48
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,500
Rock. So if I go
with paper, I'll win?

49
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,333
But she knows that, so--!

50
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,583
[TAKAGI laughs]

51
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,500
I told you I was
going with rock.

52
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,125
[NISHIKATA]
I hate you!

53
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,166
You need to trust me more.

54
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,625
[NISHIKATA]
I won't be tricked twice.

55
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,458
I'll take her word
for it next time.

56
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,875
Oh!

57
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,791
And I'm not gonna tell
you what I'm picking anymore.

58
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:49,875
[NISHIKATA]
Man.

59
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,083
I knew it.

60
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,041
She's messing with me again.

61
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,291
[NAKAI]
Hmm?

62
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,291
Nishikata!

63
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,125
Uh. Hey, Nakai!

64
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,833
What's goin' on in here?

65
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,833
You two just felt
like hangin' out?

66
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,291
No, I was loud in class,

67
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,625
so I have to clean
the room as punishment.

68
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,333
[NAKAI]
Hm. That's rough, man.

69
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,541
[NISHIKATA]
What about you?

70
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,041
Me? I'm, uh...

71
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,250
...just hangin' around.

72
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,458
You know.

73
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,291
[NISHIKATA]
Oh. Okay.

74
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,666
Hey, Nakai.

75
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,458
Let's not get
in their way, yeah?

76
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,541
Oh. You're right.

77
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,625
Well, we'll be on our way.

78
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,041
[NISHIKATA]
Cool. See yah around.

79
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,541
[NAKAI]
Oh, and Nishikata.

80
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,666
Huh?

81
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,250
Good luck to yah, dude!

82
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,208
Uh. Oh, right.

83
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,291
With this?

84
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,125
[MANO] Come on,
let's just get out of here.

85
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,250
Sorry, Takagi!

86
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,166
[TAKAGI]
Mm-hm.

87
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,208
See yah!

88
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,041
By the way,
bet you didn't know.

89
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,416
They're going out.

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,916
Wait, what? They are?

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,708
Seriously? I had no idea.

92
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,958
I mean, I did notice
them hanging out

93
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,208
a lot lately, but still...

94
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,083
It's not like they're
trying to hide it.

95
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,583
It's just that they're
both the kind of people

96
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,166
who wouldn't announce it.

97
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,666
True.

98
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,458
He said he's hanging around,
and she was with him.

99
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,500
But if you notice, they were
on their way to the rooftop.

100
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,791
The... The rooftop?

101
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,625
And right about now,

102
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,000
they're probably
all alone up there.

103
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,083
[NISHIKATA]
Huh? Just the two of them?

104
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,625
[TAKAGI]
You gonna clean?

105
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,583
Huh? Uh. Yeah!

106
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,750
I am.

107
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:39,000
Aww. Enjoying their time.

108
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,625
[NISHIKATA]
With each other.

109
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,583
Up there together.

110
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,583
I wonder what-- 

111
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,875
[TAKAGI]
I wonder what it's like.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,166
Up there.

113
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,541
Right?

114
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,333
Yeah. I guess so.

115
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,250
Hey. I finished.

116
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,041
[TAKAGI]
Okay, then.

117
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,416
[BOTH]
Rock, paper, scissors.

118
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,333
[NISHIKATA] How did I
end up losing every time?

119
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,791
Well, that's finally done!

120
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,833
Let's go. It's getting late.

121
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,416
So casual.

122
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,000
I hope you learned your lesson
and won't tease me in class now.

123
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,083
I guess.

124
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,583
I could always
just be more discreet.

125
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,791
[NISHIKATA] We're gonna
get in trouble no matter what!

126
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,416
Yeah, well,
if it happens, it happens.

127
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,291
Not to mention.

128
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,875
I wasn't even told to
clean in the first place.

129
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,208
Huh? You've gotta be kidding!

130
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,708
Okay, for real.

131
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,250
Why am I the only one who
gets in trouble all the time?

132
00:06:55,333 --> 00:07:00,083
So you're just here to
mess with me, like usual?

133
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,833
[TAKAGI]
There's that, but...

134
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,875
...I wanted to
enjoy my time, too.

135
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:11,000
Huh? Enjoy...

136
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,000
...your time?

137
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,625
[TAKAGI]
And on that note,

138
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,708
you're buying me
juice on our way home.

139
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,708
[NISHIKATA]
What? Why?

140
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,875
[NISHIKATA]
"Kickover."

141
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,500
The sun's killing me.

142
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,833
Yeah, me too.

143
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,458
I'm really thirsty.

144
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,958
Oh! I know.

145
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,041
How about a competition
and the loser buys drinks.

146
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,041
Yeah, why not?

147
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,166
Can I decide what
we compete in then?

148
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,833
Think I've got a good idea.

149
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,375
[TAKAGI]
The high bar?

150
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,541
Uh-huh. Whichever one
of us can't do a kickover

151
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,125
on the high bar is the loser.

152
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,250
[NISHIKATA] I just happened
to try doing a kickover

153
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,958
on the high bar recently.

154
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,375
And bam!

155
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,708
I was actually able to
for the first time in my life!

156
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,583
[NISHIKATA] Ever since then,
I've been itchin' for my chance

157
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,916
to show Takagi up in a duel!

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,458
To be honest, I wouldn't
be all that surprised

159
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,708
if she could do one, too.

160
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,916
[NIHSIKATA]
But!

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,750
Hey, Nishikata.

162
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,291
You realize,
I'm wearing a skirt, right?

163
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,791
[NISHIKATA]
Exactly!

164
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,500
Can't flip over the
bar wearing a skirt!

165
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,083
She's unable to compete!

166
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,041
I win!

167
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,166
Oh, well.

168
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,333
I call dibs on
going first, then.

169
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,083
[NISHIKATA]
Eh?

170
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,041
Really? You want to?

171
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,416
Yeah, it's fine.

172
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,333
However, I'd like
to add one extra rule.

173
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,541
You can't watch me.

174
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,500
Huh?

175
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,750
You're surprised?

176
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,875
I am wearing a skirt.

177
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,500
So if you look at me on my turn,
then you're the loser.

178
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,833
[TAKAGI]
Here I go!

179
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,791
Okay.

180
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,416
Your turn, show me what you got.

181
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,541
[NISHIKATA]
Did she really do it?

182
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,500
I have no way of knowing.

183
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,583
Whatever, now's not the time.

184
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,458
I've gotta focus
on the task at hand!

185
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,458
Whoa.

186
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,583
Well, we both
were able to do it.

187
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,000
So what now?

188
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,375
One more time. Do over.

189
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,500
All right.

190
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,500
Then I'll go first again, 'kay?

191
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,166
[NISHIKATA]
No hesitation.

192
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,750
That's not a good sign.

193
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,125
She's either really confident
or hiding something.

194
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,833
I bet she's not even
doing a kickover.

195
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,458
She said I lose if
I look during her turn.

196
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,000
But it's a different story
if she's cheating.

197
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,041
Today's the day
that I finally beat her!

198
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,375
[NISHIKATA]
No way!

199
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,666
She's actually doing it?

200
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,708
[NISHIKATA]
Shorts?!

201
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm done.

202
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,750
You can turn around now.

203
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,125
[TAKAGI]
What's wrong?

204
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,333
[NISHIKATA]
Sorry, Takagi.

205
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,166
I lose.

206
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,291
Here.

207
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,375
[TAKAGI]
Thanks.

208
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,625
Though, I don't really
feel like a winner.

209
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,708
Since you disqualified
yourself and all.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,083
Yeah, about that.

211
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,625
If you had shorts
on the whole time,

212
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,208
then why didn't you
let me watch you do it?

213
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,250
Pervert.

214
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,666
[gasps]

215
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,833
Hey, don't get the wrong idea!

216
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,000
I just wanted to make sure

217
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,000
you were actually
swinging over the bar!

218
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,166
[TAKAGI]
Really?

219
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,166
[NISHIKATA]
Yes, really!

220
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,583
[TAKAGI]
All right, then.

221
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,208
So you thought
I was cheating, is that it?

222
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,750
[NISHIKATA]
What?! No, I just... Ugh...

223
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,833
All right, what's the big idea?

224
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:41,250
Why are you always picking
on me, day in and day out?

225
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,000
It's nothing.

226
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,250
[KYUNKO]
Huh? Ba-dump!

227
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,500
Be straight.

228
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,916
You like being treated
this way, don't you?

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,791
[KYUNKO]
Ahh... Squeal!

230
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,041
I said,

231
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,083
"You like being treated
this way, don't you?"

232
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,375
[KYUNKO]
Ahh... Squeal!

233
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,583
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i>
is so good!

234
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,375
[NISHIKATA sneezes]

235
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,791
[NISHIKATA]
"Cold."

236
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,541
Pay attention,
this part's important.

237
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,708
And you can bet it's
gonna be on the test.

238
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,250
So make sure you remember it.

239
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,958
[NISHIKATA]
Morning. Sorry I'm late.

240
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,875
Hey, Nishikata.

241
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,333
I wasn't expecting you.
I thought you were out sick.

242
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,750
Are you feeling better?

243
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,750
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah. I think so.

244
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:00,041
[TAKAGI]
Morning. You have a cold?

245
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,583
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah.

246
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,291
But it's nothing.

247
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,666
I can handle it.

248
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,208
No big deal.

249
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,708
Nailed it!

250
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,041
Huh?

251
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,083
I bet you just stayed up
watching <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

252
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,083
[NISHIKATA]
How did she figure that out?

253
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,708
[KYUNKO]
Squeal, squeal!

254
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,625
Don't say that so loud,
it's embarrassing!

255
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,541
[TANABE] Funny,
I only heard you screaming.

256
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,625
You're right. Sorry, sir!

257
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,291
Come on, that was
really low, Takagi.

258
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,208
[coughs]

259
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,041
[TAKAGI]
You okay?

260
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,208
You're coughing.

261
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,291
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah. It's not that bad.

262
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,791
[NISHIKATA]
Man.

263
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,041
She won't pull any punches
even when I'm sick!

264
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,541
Heh...

265
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,791
But luckily, I have the ultimate
plan to defeat her today!

266
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,333
[KYUNKO] Wait, what's
a guy like him doing here?

267
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,708
Him and his perfect hair!

268
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,916
Now I'm really mad!

269
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,291
I'm going to give him
a piece of my mind!

270
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,500
Hey!

271
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,541
Oh wow.

272
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,875
You're so cute.

273
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,500
[KYUNKO gasps]

274
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,250
Squeal!

275
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,708
[NISHIKATA]
I can do that!

276
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,541
I may have caught a cold,
but it was worth it

277
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,500
for the invaluable
knowledge I've gained!

278
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,416
[NISHIKATA]
Okay, Takagi. Come at me.

279
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,458
Gimme your best shot!

280
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll counter it
and make you blush!

281
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:38,625
Ni--

282
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,291
[coughs]

283
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:52,916
[NISHIKATA]
Come on!

284
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,291
Whenever you're ready!

285
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,708
[slap, slap]

286
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,291
[NISHIKATA]
Uh...

287
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:00,833
Uh. What?

288
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,333
Don't worry. 'S nothing.

289
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,166
[NISHIKATA]
Weird.

290
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,291
She isn't making her move.

291
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,416
I can't stay in
this pose forever.

292
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,625
And my right hand's on my chin,
so I can't even take notes.

293
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,083
[gasps]

294
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,458
Wait, what if she figured
it out because of the pose?

295
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,166
Is it too obvious
I've got a counter-trap ready

296
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,541
to spring on her?

297
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,416
[NISHIKATA]
One way to find out.

298
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,875
Sit normally.

299
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,541
[NISHIKATA grunts]
What's her deal today?

300
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,041
I don't understand!

301
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,166
Any other day, she'd have
teased me three times by now!

302
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,291
Is she sick or something?

303
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,791
Huh?

304
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,750
[NISHIKATA] When she's quiet,
she's really...

305
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,166
[gasps]

306
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,250
[NISHIKATA]
Uh-oh.

307
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,958
I think I'm starting to
second guess my plan here.

308
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,250
Countering with "You're cute,"

309
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,791
when she messes with
me might be embarrassing.

310
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,541
Duh, of course it is!

311
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,250
How did I ever think
I'd be able to say that?

312
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,208
I bet it's because I'm sick, and
didn't get any sleep last night.

313
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,250
[TAKAGI]
Are you okay?

314
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,166
Hey.

315
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,041
[NISHIKATA gasps]
Uh. Yeah.

316
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,333
It's all good.

317
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,125
Your face is a little red.

318
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:45,833
Huh?

319
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:46,875
And you look tired.

320
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,250
Sure you're good?

321
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,041
[NISHIKATA]
Yes, I'm fine.

322
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,583
But you're getting even redder.

323
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,125
Do you have a fever?

324
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,958
[NISHIKATA] Why are you being
so nice to me today, Takagi?

325
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,375
How many times
do I have to tell you?

326
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,041
I'm totally okay!

327
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:00,875
Really?

328
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,000
[NISHIKATA]
Really!

329
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,583
When I said I was feeling sick,

330
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,666
it was more like
an excuse, anyway.

331
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,541
I really just woke up
at like, eight-thirty,

332
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,833
so that's why I was late.

333
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,791
I'm fine! Promise!

334
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,500
[TAKAGI]
Okay.

335
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,500
I guess I believe you.

336
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,125
It's about time!

337
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,166
So... I can tease you again.

338
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,958
Huh? What do you mean?

339
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,583
[NISHIKATA]
And of course,

340
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,166
she ended up making fun of
me more than usual that day.

341
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,958
Young love!

342
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,291
Squeal!

343
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,625
Yukari, Sanae,
what's with the snail's pace?

344
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,958
Power walk, let's go!

345
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,666
Why should I exert
myself that much for a popsicle?

346
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,875
Cus, it's the baked
sweet potato flavor!

347
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,583
It's a summer exclusive!

348
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,458
That's a weird flavor
for summer.

349
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,541
They're sold out of it
everywhere that I've looked.

350
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,666
But I think this one
snack store will have it.

351
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,833
So we gotta check
before they sell out too!

352
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,375
What are you doing?

353
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,666
There's no point
in taking a shortcut

354
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,708
if you're gonna drag
your feet the whole time!

355
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,583
[YUKARI] I just noticed
Takagi and Nishikata

356
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,875
are inside the store.

357
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,083
[MINA]
Oh hey. You're right.

358
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,625
[YUKARI] Could it be
that those two are...?

359
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,458
Mina, maybe we
shouldn't get in their way--

360
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,500
[MINA]
Hey! Takagi!

361
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,875
[sighs]

362
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,291
[MINA]
"Tailing."

363
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,875
Sha-bam!

364
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,791
Got my sweet potato pop!

365
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,500
Uh. I'm happy for you.

366
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,083
See you tomorrow.

367
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,291
They're so lucky.

368
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,375
Lucky how?

369
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,000
Well, look at the two of them.

370
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,000
You know.

371
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,708
A guy and a girl together.

372
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,333
It's just nice.

373
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,625
[NISHIKATA]
Huh? Why?

374
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,125
[TAKAGI laughs]
You didn't notice?

375
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,291
Don't blame me,
it was your idea.

376
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:54,958
[laughs]

377
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,583
Hey. Why exactly
are we following them?

378
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,416
We live in the
opposite direction.

379
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,416
[YUKARI]
Shhh!

380
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,958
They're gonna notice us.
Shut up!

381
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,416
Just tell me what you think.

382
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,750
Don't you feel,

383
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,083
I dunno, like something's
going on between them?

384
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,208
[MINA]
Hmm...

385
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,375
Oh! They've got
a bike right there!

386
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,750
They should be
riding it together, right?

387
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,875
That is so romantic!

388
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,708
Riding home
together after school.

389
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,583
Oh, but that's a tough decision,
because you can spend

390
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,666
a lot more time together
if you walk instead!

391
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,583
Maybe if you trade off
every other day?

392
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,083
Can I have a bite of that?

393
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,375
Uh. Yeah,
but just one bite, okay?

394
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,666
[sighs]

395
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,708
[SANAE]
Hey, Takagi.

396
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,458
You wanna race somewhere?

397
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,000
Are you challenging me?

398
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,041
Uh-huh!

399
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,583
We'll start once
we turn that corner.

400
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,458
The first one to make it
all the way to the shrine wins.

401
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,791
Hmm. Okay, why not?

402
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:47,000
Haha. She either has to
ride her bike or pull it.

403
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,166
With that flat tire,
she'll lose either way.

404
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,458
You have way
too wild an imagination!

405
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,083
I guarantee you they're not
talking about a race!

406
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,208
They're talking about something
more intimate than that.

407
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,000
I just know it!

408
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,916
Nishikata.

409
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,666
I'm up for us
racing to the shrine.

410
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,083
But before that...

411
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,583
[NISHIKATA]
Hmm?

412
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,208
[YUKARI]
They're gone?

413
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,375
Did they make it all the
way to the shrine already?

414
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,000
No way!

415
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,375
[YUKARI] Maybe they realized
we were tailing them.

416
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:32,166
[MINA] Ugh, come on,
let's go home already.

417
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,166
[YUKARI]
Uh. Yeah.

418
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,625
[MINA] I say we buy more
popsicles on the way.

419
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,166
[SANAE]
Will you let me have a bite?

420
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,250
[MINA] Just buy your own if
you're gonna keep eating mine!

421
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,125
[NISHIKATA]
So close.

422
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,541
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

423
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,625
Ah. Did we lose them?

424
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,750
Any idea why they
were following us

425
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,416
in the first place?

426
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,083
No.

427
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,416
Hey, uh...

428
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,625
Now that I think about it,

429
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,708
we should have gone
around that corner too.

430
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,041
It would have been a lot
easier to hide over there.

431
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,416
[TAKAGI]
Huh.

432
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,708
I hadn't thought about that,
guess you're right.

433
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,666
But I wonder...

434
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,000
Would you have
preferred if we did?

435
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,416
Well, no.

436
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,000
It doesn't really matter.

437
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:30,958
Good!

438
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,166
I'm glad.

439
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,750
Oh, I almost forgot!

440
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,125
We're racing to
the shrine, yeah?

441
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,875
Ready, set go!

442
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,500
Huh?! Hey, hold on!

443
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,375
I'm callin' you out!

444
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,666
That's a false start, Takagi!

445
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:21,125
[MINA] Tailing those two turned
out to be kinda fun in the end.

446
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,166
Takin' the long way home.

447
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,958
[YUKARI] They probably did
notice us following them.

448
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,291
I better apologize
to Takagi tomorrow.

449
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,208
[MINA screams]

450
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:33,500
They're out of the
baked sweet potato flavor!

451
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,500
It's okay!

452
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,500
They got red bean soup!

453
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,500
What is with you wanting
these flavors in the summer?

454
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,583
So you gonna let me have a bite?

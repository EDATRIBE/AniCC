1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,625
Well...

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,625
As I'm sure you know, summer
vacation starts tomorrow.

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,916
Try not to get into any trouble.

4
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,541
[class cheers]

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,458
[MINA] Summer vacation
is gonna be awesome!

6
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,916
[TAKAO]
Hey.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,958
We're thinking of going to
the beach tomorrow, you in?

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,458
Yeah, you know it, dude.

9
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,291
[KIMURA] I suddenly have
a huge craving for watermelon!

10
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,500
[NISHIKATA]
I'd eat some watermelon.

11
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:30,958
[TAKAO] Perfect!
Let's get one for tomorrow!

12
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:31,958
[NISHIKATA]
Good idea!

13
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,833
[NISHIKATA]
"Tandem Riding."

14
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,083
Summer vacation.

15
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,500
You excited?

16
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,750
Yeah.

17
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,000
It feels like I've been
waiting for it forever.

18
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,000
Now I can play
as much as I want!

19
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,208
I'm a free man!

20
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,541
You better not forget
about your homework.

21
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,291
Knowing you, you'll put it off.

22
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,125
I bet you're thinking
"play first, work later."

23
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,083
[NISHIKATA]
How'd you know?

24
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,833
Haha! So I was right?

25
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,208
Well yeah.

26
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,708
But the whole point of
a break is to relax, right?

27
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,750
I wanna go to the pool, hit the
beach, and go camping and stuff.

28
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,166
Man, I barely have
enough time to do all that!

29
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,166
[sighs] I wish we could just
have summer vacation forever.

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,666
Yeah?

31
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,291
I like going to school,
too, though.

32
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,166
Because...

33
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,666
[TAKAGI]
It's fun.

34
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,500
[TAKAGI] No more of
that for a while, huh?

35
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,708
So hot!

36
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,500
But the breeze feels great!

37
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,750
Can you go faster? This rocks!

38
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,416
[NAKAI] You wouldn't be saying
that if you were pedaling!

39
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,375
[TAKAGI]
It's hot out.

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,375
Should we do what
they were doing?

41
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,458
Huh?!

42
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,000
Of course, you'd
have to be in the front.

43
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,708
No. We can't!

44
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,041
Uh. 'Cuz it'd be dangerous
with cars driving by, you know?

45
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,416
There are no cars around.

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,625
It's not even a public road.

47
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,916
Yeah, but.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,958
Hold on.

49
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,541
Are you embarrassed
or something?

50
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,333
No! Of course
I'm not embarrassed!

51
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,083
Oh.

52
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,750
You can't do it, then?

53
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,333
Tandem riding is super easy.

55
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:50,000
I just don't think we should
do it, 'cuz it's not safe.

56
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,875
[TAKAGI] Let's go to
the vacant lot, then.

57
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,041
Huh?!

58
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,916
If you can't do it,
then you owe me a juice.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,541
[NISHIKATA]
I hope you're not too thirsty,

60
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,833
because I got this, no sweat.

61
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,458
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

62
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,250
That was just the practice run!

63
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,958
I can do this!

64
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,750
I'll take grape.

65
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,166
Could ya gimme a second?!

66
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,416
Is it really this hard to ride

67
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,083
with someone sitting
on the back of a bike?

68
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,666
Just checking, but you're
not trying to throw us

69
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,791
off balance on purpose, are you?

70
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,250
Of course not.

71
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,291
Are you sure.

72
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,750
I'm just sitting
how I usually sit.

73
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,083
If we can't get it to work,

74
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,958
then it's gotta be your fault.

75
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,791
I mean...

76
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,625
...the last time I did
this with someone.

77
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,916
They didn't have
any trouble peddling.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,916
Oh, really?

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,375
That's cool.

80
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,416
I take it they were a girl?

81
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,416
[TAKAGI]
Nope.

82
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,750
Not a girl.

83
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,625
I see.

84
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,958
[growls]

85
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,458
One more time.

86
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,583
I think I've almost got it!

87
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,750
This time for sure!

88
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,583
What's going on?

89
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,708
Why do I feel so frustrated?

90
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,750
I'm just riding a bike!

91
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,541
What's up?

92
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,625
You're getting into this.

93
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,000
No, I'm not!

94
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,375
I just don't wanna waste
my hard earned money on you!

95
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,625
Yeah, that's it!

96
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,916
I just don't want to buy
her a drink! That's all!

97
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,625
Hey!

98
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,958
We're moving!

99
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,875
By the way, Nishikata,

100
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,583
the last time I rode on
the back of someone's bike,

101
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,833
it was my dad's.

102
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,375
I think I was four at the time.

103
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,875
[crash]

104
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,500
Take it.

105
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,541
Why, thank you.

106
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,250
[gasps]

107
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,166
Ahh...

108
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,875
That's good!

109
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,250
Are you not gonna get
yourself a drink, too?

110
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,750
Uh. Nope.

111
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,833
I'm, uhh, not thirsty.

112
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,208
I can't tell her I have
no money to buy my own.

113
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,041
How would that look?

114
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,625
Want some?

115
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,750
No.

116
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,333
I'm fine, thanks.

117
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:16,333
She'd just call it an indirect
kiss again to get me to blush.

118
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,083
Come on, I know you're thirsty.

119
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:18,875
Have some.

120
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,291
I really don't want any.

121
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,291
[NISHIKATA]
Endure it.

122
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,416
You can do it.

123
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,791
Endure.

124
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,750
[clank]

125
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,083
Drink this.

126
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,833
We can't have you
getting heatstroke.

127
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,416
I can have it?

128
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,000
[TAKAGI]
Yeah.

129
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,916
Besides.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,333
I know you.

131
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,750
You don't want mine
because it's an indirect kiss.

132
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,625
Huh?!

133
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,125
Tha-That's not it!

134
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,916
I'm just not thirsty!

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,166
Right.

136
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,708
But you'll drink yours?

137
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,750
Well, you already bought it.

138
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,416
It'd be a waste
when it's this hot.

139
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,875
Thanks for the drink.

140
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,625
We won't be walking
home from school for a while.

141
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,583
Ahhh...

142
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,458
Got that right.

143
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,375
We're on vacation, after all.

144
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,541
I know!

145
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,791
How about starting tomorrow,

146
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,583
we practice tandem
riding here until noon?

147
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,166
[NISHIKATA]
Okay, I guess.

148
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,208
But not on the road.

149
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,333
[TAKAGI]
That's what I meant.

150
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,041
We'll just ride here.

151
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,500
If we're only
ever gonna ride here,

152
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,583
there's no point in practicing.

153
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,916
Yeah, there is.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,041
You know.

155
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,583
Summer vacation.

156
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,833
It starts tomorrow.

157
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,708
[NISHIKATA]
What does that mean?

158
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,666
[TAKAGI]
All right!

159
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,083
Well, we should head home.

160
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,375
[TAKAGI]
Summer vacation.

161
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,625
Huh?

162
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,541
I'm excited.

163
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,000
It'll be fun!

164
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,875
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah, obviously.

165
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,500
[MINA]
"First Day of Summer Vacation."

166
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,208
[SANAE] Why'd it have
to rain on our first day off?

167
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,333
[MINA]
I know.

168
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,791
Summer vacation's
barely even started,

169
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,875
and my plans are already ruined!

170
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,750
It's not like it's supposed
to rain tomorrow.

171
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,166
[MINA] I wanted
to go to the pool today.

172
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,708
And I'm never
getting that time back!

173
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,291
Please stop crying.

174
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,166
You know we can't do
anything about the rain.

175
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,000
Let's just start our homework.

176
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,250
--Huh?
--Huh?

177
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,958
What's with those faces?

178
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,750
Don't tell me you
two didn't bring yours.

179
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,208
I told you guys to bring
your homework over

180
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,500
since it's raining out!

181
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,458
I figured I must
have misheard you.

182
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,666
Unbelievable!

183
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,875
Why do we get assigned homework

184
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,041
during summer vacation
in the first place?

185
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,958
It's a violation
of human rights.

186
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,875
It's hardly a break
with homework.

187
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,250
Right?

188
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,000
Dream all you want,
we still have to do it.

189
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,791
[MINA whines]

190
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,541
Ugh! Do me a personal
favor, Yukari:

191
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,833
Quit doing your
homework and relax!

192
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,250
Seeing you do yours reminds me

193
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,125
that I have to do mine,
and now I can't enjoy myself!

194
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,166
Whatever!

195
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,833
Maybe you need the reminder!

[groans]

197
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,666
It's only the first day still.

198
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,125
Just forget about school.

199
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,458
[YUKARI] Typical, from a
person who will be crying

200
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,958
with regret on
August thirty-first.

201
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,791
You're so stubborn.

202
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,958
Forget you.
I'm gonna read manga.

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,916
Yeah?

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,166
Fine.

205
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,708
Hey, Yukari?

206
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,000
[YUKARI]
Hmm?

207
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,250
I got a great idea.

208
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,375
Can we write our
book report on manga?

209
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,333
Yes, please.

210
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,041
Can you two just
go home already?

[NISHIKATA]
"Test of Courage."

212
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,916
It stopped raining.

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,583
Awesome!

214
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,791
Wait, why exactly am
I happy about that again?

[approaching footsteps]

216
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,833
[TAKAGI]
Nishikata.

217
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,416
[chuckles]

218
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,458
You're here.

219
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,666
Yeah, we made a
promise, didn't we?

220
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,125
Guess so.

221
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,208
Something wrong?

222
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,208
Uh.

223
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,333
No.

224
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,166
It's nothing.

225
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,208
Whoa.

226
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,125
There are so many puddles here.

227
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,458
Well, you know what they say.

228
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,208
When it rains, it pours.

229
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,000
[NISHIKATA] I didn't recognize
her for a second there.

230
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,500
Come to think of it,

231
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,833
I've run into her a few times
on our days off by chance,

232
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,541
but this is our first
time meeting up.

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,666
[gasps]

234
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,666
[NISHIKATA]
No way!

235
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,916
This isn't like, a date, is it?

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,708
No, obviously not!

237
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,041
We're just here to
practice tandem riding,

238
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,291
like we agreed to!

239
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,458
Nishikata?

240
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,916
Huh?! What's up?

241
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,875
You hear me?

242
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,750
Hello?

243
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,791
No. Sorry.

244
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,750
What did you say?

245
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,250
[TAKAGI] This place is in
pretty bad riding condition.

246
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,583
[NISHIKATA]
Uh, yeah.

247
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,916
Actually,

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,916
I was planning to go out
after we practiced today.

249
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,458
No sense going back home.

250
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you wanna hang out
with me to kill some time?

251
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,916
[NISHIKATA gasps]
Okay.

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,041
Is this a date?

253
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,750
No, no, no.

254
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,750
No way!

255
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,791
Uh. Yeah, that's fine.

256
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,625
But let's go someplace where
there aren't too many people.

257
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,333
There's no telling what
our classmates would say

258
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,750
if they saw us!

259
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,458
[TAKAGI]
Hmmm...

260
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,041
How about...

261
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,875
That's it!

262
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,791
[NISHIKATA]
A test of courage?

263
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,666
[TAKAGI]
Perfect for summer, right?

264
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,958
Wouldn't it be scarier
if we did it at night?

265
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,333
[TAKAGI]
Not by much.

266
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,791
I heard it gets pitch black
when you're in there.

267
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,416
Some say, there's a presence.

268
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Sorry.

269
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,208
What?

270
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,333
A presence?

271
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,125
Well, that's what I heard.

272
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,666
This tunnel doesn't
have any sharp turns.

273
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,083
But for some reason,

274
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,833
a lot of cars ended up crashing
straight into the walls.

275
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,500
So they had to make
a new road nearby.

276
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,416
And since then,
every night, without fail,

277
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,708
a bloodthirsty ghost appears.

278
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,125
Looking for cars to prey upon.

279
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,041
But there's even more to it.

280
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,125
Rumor has it.

281
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,625
People are spirited away here.

282
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,083
Dozens.

283
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,291
Maybe more have disappeared
right in this very tunnel.

284
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,750
Are you going in?

285
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,958
Or are you chicken?

286
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,166
I am so not chicken!

287
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,208
It's the middle of the day!

288
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,416
Why would I be scared

289
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,416
of going in some dusty,
stupid, old tunnel?

290
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,333
[NISHIKATA]
It's way darker than I thought.

291
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,125
Why is the wind making
such a weird noise?

292
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,041
Hey.

293
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,166
Check out what's on the wall.

294
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,750
[NISHIKATA]
A talisman?

295
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,750
For spirits.

296
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,166
It keeps them away.

297
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,708
So clearly,

298
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,666
there must be
something evil in here.

299
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,208

00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,458

301
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,583
I'm not surprised you're scared.

302
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,458
I'm not!

303
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,916
I was just shocked, that's all!

304
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,958
Look!

305
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,416
Uh, great; what is it this time?

306
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,500
[TAKAGI]
Weird.

307
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,750
I wonder what this
steel barrel is doing here.

308
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,875
Uh. Yeah.

309
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:14,666
All right.

310
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,208
I vote you look inside.

311
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,125
Huh?

312
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,291
Are you scared?

313
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,958
Will you stop saying that?

314
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,125
I'll look.

315
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,416
It's not that big of a deal.

316
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,250
[TAKAGI]
Ah!

317
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,458

[sighs]

319
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,333
That's what I was
really worried about!

320
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,375
Takagi?

321
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,666
Takagi?

322
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,833
Where'd you run off to?

323
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,500
Quit messing with me.

324
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:03,916

Didn't she mention something

325
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,541
about being spirited away?

326
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,625
But that couldn't...

327
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,958
Takagi!

328
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,833
Answer me!

329
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,583

What are you freaking out for?

333
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,625
It's just me.

334
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,291
Where'd you come from?

335
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,541
Hey.

336
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,250
You were looking for me
just now, weren't you?

337
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,958
Huh? Yeah right.

338
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,833
Why would I do that?

339
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,291
So she lured me in here
to jump-scare me a ton.

340
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:38,500
Whoa.

341
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,916
Look at that.

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's a big hole.

343
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,625
Why don't you take
a peek inside it?

344
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,208
[NISHIKATA] Like I'd fall for
the same trick twice.

345
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,500
Don't make me laugh!

346
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,875
Oh no, I'm stuck!

347
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,958
My hand's stuck in the hole!

348
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,375
How do you like my acting?

349
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,458
I've been working on it.

350
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,541
I'm gonna freak you out so bad!

351
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,125
I don't know what,

352
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,083
but it feels like something's
pulling me from the other side!

353
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,250
Help me--!

00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,208

357
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,583
Did I scare you?

358
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,250
No.

359
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,250
What is that?

360
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,750
I dunno,
I found it on the ground.

[NISHIKATA growls]

00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,291
Oh!

363
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,125
Glad your hand came loose.

364
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,083
[NISHIKATA]
Man.

365
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,875
I gotta find some way to get
her before we leave this tunnel!

366
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,208
[water droplet]

367
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,541
[laughs]

368
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,625
As jumpy as usual.

369
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,750
Ahh...

370
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,166
Some fresh air!

371
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,416
This sucks.

372
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,791
I couldn't find anything
to get her back with.

373
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,750
Must be another couple on
a date in the spooky tunnel.

374
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,333
Don't bother them.

375
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,125
Let's go.

376
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,041
[GIRL]
Okay.

377
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,208
[chuckles]
She called it a "date."

378
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,416
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

379
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,125
[TAKAGI]
Hmm?

380
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,125
What is it?

381
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,875
You're blushing again.

382
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,875
Did you have fun back there?

383
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,291
Because I did.

384
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,750
I guess.

385
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,458
Yeah, but...

386
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,708
It's almost noon,
we should go back home soon.

387
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,541
Yeah, let's.

388
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,125
What way are you going?

389
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,208
[NISHIKATA moans] You want
to go back through there?

390
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,250
[TAKAGI]
Yeah, why not?

391
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,333
Are you scared?

392
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,708
[NISHIKATA]
When am I ever?

393
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,875
[NISHIKATA]
I met my quota for the day.

394
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:27,583
Wait.

395
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,125
It's summer vacation.

396
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,416
Why do I still have just as
many push-ups to do as normal?

397
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,375
[YUKARI]
"Summer Science Project."

398
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,958
[MINA] Yes, the consommé
flavor is quite good.

399
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:39,875
[SANAE]
Don't lie.

400
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,083
Your eyes are watering.

401
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,500
[MINA]
No, they're not.

402
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,875
And I know it's better
than your kelp flavor.

403
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,333
[YUKARI]
They both sound awful.

404
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,125
There are so many
flavors to choose from.

405
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,791
Why would you pick those?

406
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,416
[MINA] You wouldn't
understand, miss watermelon.

407
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,000
[SANAE] Take risks while
you're still young, right?

408
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,875
[YUKARI] That's some philosophy
to apply to popsicles.

409
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,541
[MINA] Hey, did you
two decide on subjects

410
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,000
for the science project?

411
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,000
[SANAE]
Not yet.

412
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,458
[YUKARI]
Me neither.

413
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,541
[SANAE]
You?

414
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,500
[MINA]
I'm still thinking, too.

415
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,541
[MINA] Isn't there
something easy I can do?

416
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,500
Like, finish-in-a-day easy?

417
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,458
Just do actual research.

418
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,000
[SANAE]
Hmm...

419
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,000
A dog observation diary?

420
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,583
Ah! Awesome idea!

421
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,333
That sounds super easy!

422
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,041
And dogs basically behave
the same way every day.

423
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,500
So I can just copy the entries
and change the dates!

424
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,000
If you're gonna lie,
write it by hand at least.

425
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,166
Besides, dogs
barely do anything.

426
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,083
They wake up, bark
for a walk, bark to be fed,

427
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,958
and sleep every chance they get.

428
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,916
Maybe they'll wake up
and bark for attention,

429
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,250
but then they'll just
bark for food again.

430
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,625
Why would anyone
want to observe that?

431
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,791
You're such a
stick in the mud, Yukari.

432
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,875
Well she is the class president.

433
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,666
It comes with the territory.

434
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,250
Right?

435
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,916
[YUKARI]
Shut up.

436
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,083
Anyway, have you two started
to do your homework yet?

437
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,000
We've still got plenty of time.

438
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,458
Right?

439
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,250
[sighs]

440
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,166
Just so you know.

441
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,041
You're not copying mine.

442
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,250
Not even if I do your
science project for you?

443
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,125
On a dog?

444
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,291
No, thank you.

445
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,833
You say this now,
but you're gonna end up

446
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,708
sharing your answers
with us anyway.

447
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,583
She wants the class
to get good grades.

448
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,166
Right?

449
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,708
[YUKARI] Maybe I should
do an observation diary

450
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,000
on their procrastination habits.

451
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,916
[NISHIKATA]
"Water Tap."

452
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,916
So hot.

453
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,333
This is the worst day
of vacation yet.

454
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,750
[shrieks]

455
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,666
Are you kidding?

456
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,125
First, I overslept.

457
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,666
[NISHIKATA]
And then I had a flat tire.

458
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,083
[NISHIKATA]
But at least all this happened

459
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,208
on a day we're not
practicing tandem riding.

460
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,958
Takagi said she was going
on a family vacation.

461
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,916
[NISHIKATA] When's she
coming back from that?

462
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,916
I was gonna stay home
for a few hours and do chores,

463
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,416
so I could have
the afternoon free,

464
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,458
but of course I was
sent on a shopping trip.

465
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,375
Truly this is the
darkest of vacations.

466
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,125
That kinda sounded poetic,
I should write it down.

467
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,875
[NISHIKATA]
That looks like...

468
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,625
[NISHIKATA]
Yeah, it's Takagi.

469
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:14,833
Huh.

470
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,000
I guess she's back.

471
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,666
I might as well use this
opportunity to follow her.

472
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,125
[chuckles]

473
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,416
Maybe I can find a weakness
to exploit in the future.

474
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,041
[gasps]

475
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,250
[NISHIKATA]
Uh oh.

476
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,958
Did she see me there?

477
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,125
Maybe it was my imagination.

478
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,125
No, she did see me!

479
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,625
But I can see her hat sticking
out around the corner.

480
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,708
You think you're gonna
surprise me, don't you?

481
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,750
Not while I still may breathe!

482
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,625
I should write that down, too.

483
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,500
[laughs]

484
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,166
[NISHIKATA]
She... She got me!

485
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,166
Going somewhere?

486
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:08,875
Yeah.

487
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,708
Just grocery shopping.

488
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,375
Hey.

489
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,583
What a coincidence.

490
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,291
I am too.

491
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,625
We could take your bike,
ride tandem?

492
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,708
Come on.

493
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,750
We agreed no doing
that in the road.

494
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,541
[NISHIKATA] When did she
find out I was following her?

495
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,333
Fine.

496
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,333
Let's walk together, then.

497
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,583
[shrieks]

498
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,166
[NISHIKATA]
Oh no! I gotcha!

499
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,875
Are you okay?

500
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,541
[NISHIKATA] And the
curse of today continues.

501
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,375
[TAKAGI]
You're hurt.

502
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,083
[NISHIKATA] Nah. It's nothing.
I'll just let it be.

503
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,458
Don't do that.

504
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,625
You should wash it off.

505
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,125
[sighs]

506
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,666
[NISHIKATA]
How embarrassing.

507
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,625
[TAKAGI]
Does your knee hurt that much?

508
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,958
[NISHIKATA]
No.

509
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,625
It's just that I was
already having a bad day,

510
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,708
and now I got a cut, too.

511
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,666
I'm wallowing in how
much this vacation sucks.

512
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,875
And it's not like I can
write about my misfortunes

513
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,833
for my summer homework.

514
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:09,416
[TAKAGI]
Here.

515
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,958
Huh?

516
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,375
But it'll stain.

517
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,500
Don't worry, just take it.

518
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,541
[NISHIKATA]
Uh.

519
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,916
Thank you.

520
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,208
That feels nice!

521
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,166
[TAKAGI] So you tried
to catch me before, right?

522
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,958
Thanks for that.

523
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,208
You should come in.

524
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,166
The cold water's really nice.

525
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,583
Uh, No, I...

526
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,708
[TAKAGI]
You know you want to.

527
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,666
Cooling you down?

528
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,291
Uh.

529
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,208
You know what?

530
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,541
I had a good day.

531
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,708
Because I got to see someone.

532
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,291
Huh?

533
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,875
Wh-Who do you mean?

534
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,666
You'll get your
souvenir tomorrow.

535
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,500
[splash]

536
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,666
[NISHIKATA]
Hey!

537
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,000
Stop that Takagi,
the water's really cold!

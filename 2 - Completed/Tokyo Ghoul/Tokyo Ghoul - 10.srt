Hello, CCG Control Center-

Sir, A band of ghouls we believe

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,625
to be Aogiri Tree has
attacked the branch and--

[MARUDE] Are you there?

18
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:04,791
[TATARA] Yeah. Are
you ready to go, Eto?

19
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:08,708
[ETO] Mm-hm. Ready when
you are, Mr. Tatara.

20
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:49,125
This is terrible. What
do we know about them?

21
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,958
[YOMO] Apparently,
they're a band of ghouls

22
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,791
who call themselves Aogiri.

23
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,708
Unfortunately, we don't know
how many of them there are.

24
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,791
But we do know that
their leader...

25
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,958
...would be the
One-Eyed King.

26
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,333
Is that so?

I wonder why it's
been so slow lately.

30
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,833
Prob'ly 'cause of the
increase in doves.

[KANEKI]
Excuse me?

38
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,583
I asked you if your manager
is here, ya dumb ass!

39
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,333
No, I'm sorry. he stepped
out for a little while.

You wanna tell me
where he went, buddy?

You heard me the first time.

44
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,041
If you've got business here,

45
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,208
then you could at least
order a cup of coffee.

Um, sir.

If you need to talk
to our manager,

00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,583
I can relay a message
to him for you.

50
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,875
Nah, don't bother. I'll just
ask the two of you instead.

Know a girl named
Rize Kamishiro?

I'm lookin' for her.

54
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,541
I'm from the 11th Ward, in fact,
that's where I first met her.

55
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,166
So, what makes you think

56
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,833
that she would
show up here?

00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,333

headed to the 20th Ward.

you could say we're close--

idea where I can find her?

She isn't here anymore.

121
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,333
Oh. I gotcha.

122
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,333
I should've known. Ya can't
tie down a free spirit like her.

123
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,833
[KANEKI] I'm sorry. I
know that's not much help.

if I ask a favor of you?

Uh, no. So what's up?

Thanks, man. If you
see Rize again,

127
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,291
I need you to tell
her something for me.

128
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,708
Please tell her to run.

129
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,041
What?

130
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,333
[BANJO] A few months
ago, a band of ghouls

131
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,750
called Aogiri Tree
popped up outta nowhere.

132
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,875
They muscled their way
into the 11th Ward

133
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,833
and made it clear that
they were takin' over.

134
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,291
Since then, they've set their
sights on overpowering the doves

135
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,250
and driving them
out of our ward.

136
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:58,125
And I'm sure they'll do it. In
fact, I wouldn't be surprised

137
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,166
if they've killed all
of the doves by now.

138
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,041
Look, I've got nothing to do
with them, I'm just a runner.

139
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,333

they're headed this way.

They're searching for Rize.

00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,541
I don't know why but it
can't be anything good.

142

They're headed here?

143
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,875

same shit in the 20th Ward

144

that they pulled on us.

here before it's too late.

00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,041
I dunno where I am.

175
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,750
[JUZO]
I've spotted a police box!

176
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,750
Things are looking up!

177
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,833
The group we're dealing
with is called Aogiri Tree.

178
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,708
They have over two hundred
members that we're aware of.

179
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,791
We've never seen this many
ghouls band together before.

180
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,083
[MARUDE] So we don't
know what to expect.

181
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,333
What do you think
their objective is, sir?

182
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,416
I really wish I
could tell you.

183
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,708
Who knows what the
ghouls are thinking?

184
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:58,625
At this point, they have
control of the 11th Ward.

185
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,666
That's all we know for certain.

186
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,375
[MARUDE] We expect
their numbers to grow.

187
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,166
When word gets out
that Aogiri Tree

188
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,875
have taken control
of an entire ward,

189
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,708
the ghouls who've been
acting on their own

190
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,958
will most likely
join their ranks.

191
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,291
We must prepare for a war
between humans and ghouls!

192
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,708
And the CCG is going to be
fighting on the front lines!

193
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,500
We'll give our lives
for the cause!

194
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,083
And that's an order, by the way!

195
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,916
From here on, the 11th Ward
special task force will be--

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,166
Um, excuse me!

197
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,166
[INVESTIGATORS]
Huh?

198
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,458
Hi, I'm
Mr. Shinohara's underling,

199
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,000
the name's Juzo Suzuya!

200
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,541
Sorry to barge in late but I
kinda got lost on my way here.

201
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,041
[MARUDE gasping]

202
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,541
Juzo.

203
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,583
I hope that you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

204
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,583
So, who's this, Ayato?

205
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:49,666
[NICO] My, my. Y'know, I'd heard
your older sister lives here.

206
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,666
But no one told me she's
as gorgeous as you.

207
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,375
Oh, I'd ravish you both.

208
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:01,083
So, how did you know
I was here, Yamori?

209
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,958
[YAMORI] Easy. I just
followed your boy, Banjo.

210
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,541
Gotta say, your men
are first-rate.

211
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,500
They lead me right to ya.

212
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,500
Look, Rize isn't here
so leave them--

213
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,333
[BANJO groaning]

214
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,208
[YAMORI sniffing]

215
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,083
That stench. It reeks in here.

216
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,291
[knuckle cracks]

217
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,291
I feel like I've smelled
it somewhere before.

218
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,750
And it seems to be
comin' from you.

219
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,708
Hey, Nico.

220
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,666
You think that this one'll do?

221
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,208
Sure, why not? If that's who
you want, let's kidnap him.

222
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,458
[YAMORI chuckles]

223
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,958
Just try it! You'll
have to get through me!

224
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,750
Yeah? Okay.

225
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,458
[TOUKA grunts]
[KANEKI gags]

226
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,333
[YAMORI] There's no
standing between me

227
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,166
and what I want, little lady.

228
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,666
[KANEKI grunting]

229
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,458
[KANEKI groaning]

230
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,875
[TOUKA]
Kaneki!

231
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,083
Okay, kid. Get up, or stay down.

232
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,083
Y'know, if you play
your cards right

233
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,041
you might be able to make
it outta this ordeal alive.

234
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,375
But you've gotta behave, got it?

235
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:18,208
[KANEKI screaming]

236
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:18,958
[AYATO gasps]

237
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,166
Oh, my.

238
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,916
Whoa. You're one of
them one-eyed ghouls.

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,416
[KANEKI grunting]

240
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,041
[KANEKI coughing]

241
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,208
Damn, you!

242
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,458
[TOUKA groans]

243
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:40,666
You're such a weakling,
Touka. A carbon copy of Pop.

244
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,041
[TOUKA]
He was a hero.

245
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,416
Dad stood up and
fought for our sake.

246
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,833
You don't even have a clue!

247
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,416
[AYATO] You're the one who's
clueless, my dear sister.

248
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,583
Mom and Pop are dead and gone.

249
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,000
They didn't protect anything,
they were just taken from us.

250
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,166
But that's not
gonna happen to me.

251
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,416
It's time to teach
the humans a lesson.

252
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,875
That ghouls are superior
to them in every way!

253
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,416
[AYATO] You can't fly anywhere
on that wing of yours.

254
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,666
Crawl, like the insect you are.

255
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,625
You're so ridiculously
cool, Ayato.

256
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,250
Touka!

257
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,541
[KANEKI grunts]

258
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,666
[YAMORI]
Looks like this one

259
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,750
still has some
spunk left in him.

260
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,250
Crazy how much you
smell like her, kid.

261
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,416
[KANEKI grunting]

262
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah, there ya go.
Give it to him, baby.

263
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,791
[KANEKI groaning]

264
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,541
[YAMORI] You're a
tough guy, aren't ya?

265
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,958
Well, in that case.

266
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,291
How ya like this?

267
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,125
What about this?

268
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,625
Or this?

269
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,750
[KANEKI grunting, gasping]

270
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,875
[YAMORI] All right,
then how do ya like...

271
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,041
...this?

272
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,666
How about this?

273
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,333
How's this feel?

274
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,666
What about this?

275
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,583
How ya like this?

276
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,583
No... Kaneki.

277
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,166
[YAMORI]
How do ya like this?

278
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,750
Well, Answer me, kid!

279
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,833
What about this?

280
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,625
Or this?

281
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,750
Oh, wow!

282
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,041
I can't seem to break
this little guy!

283
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,708
Chill out, Mr. Yamori!

284
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,625
Uh, I mean, we should go, sir.

285
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,000
Huh?

286
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,833
[NICO] I hate to say it, but
goatee here is right.

287
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,125
Okay.

288
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh--

289
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:24,958
yeaaaaah.

290
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,625
Hubba-hubba.

291
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,666
[NICO moaning]

292
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,375
[NICO] Let's save the rest
for when we get home,

293
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,791
Big boy.

294
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,041
[YAMORI]
Thank you, Nico.

295
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,875
[NICO]
Aw, no problem, precious.

296
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,375
[AYATO] You heard the man, we've
gotta start heading back.

297
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,875
Hurry and stuff the one-eyed
freak in the bag, Banjo.

298
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,166
[YOSHIMURA]
Are you all right?

299
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,125
[YOSHIMURA]
They kidnapped him, didn't they?

300
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,250
Yomo. Round everyone
up for a meeting.

301
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,625
Anteiku...

302
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,208
...will have to be
closed for a while.

303
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:32,291
[JUZO humming]

304
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,166
[MARUDE] They are clearly
starting to show signs

305
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,333
of an organized movement.

306
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,125
Unfortunately, that's
all we know

307
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,750
about Aogiri Tree
at this time.

308
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,333
As much as I would love to
charge after them right now,

309
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,875
I'm afraid we have
to be patient.

310
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,708
We will engage the
enemy in one week.

311
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,458
Until then, the 11th Ward
must be evacuated.

312
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,250
Allow me to handle the media.

313
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,666
Be sure to work alongside
local police. That is all.

314
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,625
[MARUDE]
Dismissed!

315
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,041
[INVESTIGATORS]
Yes, sir!

316
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,250
[MARUDE]
So you're Juzo Suzuya?

317
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,875
I gotta admit, you're not
what I was expecting at all.

318
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,208
Uh-oh.

319
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,666
You're an awfully slender
young man, aren't ya?

320
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,250
Well, It's either that or
you're a flat-chested woman.

321
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,916
[SHINOHARA]
Now, now, Maru.

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,041
Suzuya just got here and
I'm sure he's gotta be tired.

323
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,541
Cut him some slack, would ya?

324
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,000
What gives? I was
just making small talk.

325
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:28,625
[SHINOHARA] Yeah, I know.
But it can wait until tomorrow.

326
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,708
[AMON] Suzuya's only a
3rd Class Investigator?

327
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,916
[SHINOHARA]
From what I can tell,

328
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,041
Maru's pulling all
his resources.

329
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,500
He must've decided that
we can use Juzo somehow.

330
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,666
In any case, he was
personally admitted

331
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,583
by Chairman Washu
himself, following Arima.

332
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,083
[AMON]
I see.

333
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,375
We aren't the only ones
with a problem child,

334
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,000
they've got one too.

335
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,625
And who's that, Jason?

336
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,708
Yeah. He's S-rated.

337
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,791
Hails from the 13th Ward.

338
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,291
He's a sadistic bastard
who kills for fun

339
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,833
rather than for food.

340
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,625
I wouldn't wanna go up against
him, that's for damn sure.

341
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,958
[SHINOHARA]
Wait a minute,

342
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,291
you came fact-to-face with
him once, didn't you?

343
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,375
Yeah. Well, Mr. Mado and I.

344
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh, that's right.

345
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,791
[AMON] Why can't I get
his words out of my head?

346
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,500
Please, go.

347
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,375
I don't want to be the
monster you think I am.

348
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,791
[AMON]
What he said,

349
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,583
and his expression.

350
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:30,208
It's dredging up memories that
I don't want to remember.

351
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:35,750
[YOUNG AMON panting]

352
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:44,083
Kotaro. Who said that
you could come in?

353
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,375
[SHINOHARA]
Amon.

354
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,958
Amon!

355
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,708
I'm sorry. Could you
repeat that, please?

356
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,041
It's no big deal.

357
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,625
Breathe. I just asked
if your quinque's broken.

358
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,166
Oh. Yes, sir.

359
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,166
In that case, why don't you
take one from Mado's collection?

360
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,416
[AMON]
Huh?

361
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,333
He left them all to you.
Well, I'll see ya later.

362
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,791
[AMON]
Thank you, Mr. Mado.

363
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,416
[JUZO]
Guess what Rei?

364
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
I've heard there are lots
of ghouls in the 11th Ward.

365
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,666
And I might be able to
get a new quinque.

366
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,875
I'm so excited. I can't wait!

367
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,333
[JUZO laughing]

368
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,583
Don't want mama mad again.
So I'd better behave.

369
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,875
I have to be a good boy.

370
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,333
[MARUDE]
At this point in time,

371
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,875
we're increasing our
presence in the 11th ward.

372
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,125
and working to pinpoint this
ghoul organization's base.

373
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,916
Once we can do that,
I'm confident

374
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,833
it won't take us long
to close the case.

375
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,125
[MALE REPORTER]
Do you really think

376
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,166
a full-scale evacuation
of the area is needed?

377
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,500
I mean, doesn't that
seem like overkill?

378
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,250
[MARUDE]
We feel it's necessary

379
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,416
to guarantee our
citizens' safety.

380
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,250
You can count on us. The
CCG are fighting for you.

381
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,458
In return, I ask--

382
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,208
C'mon, text me Kaneki.

383
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,625
I'm worried.

384
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,708
[TOUKA]
Hey, Hinami.

385
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,750
He'll be okay.

386
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,458
[NISHIKI] Yeah, No doubt.
The kid can take a licking.

387
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,875
Yeah, I guess so.

388
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,375
[door clicking]

389
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,250
[YOSHIMURA] I'm glad
to see you're all here.

390
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,375
A few more will
be joining us later.

391
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,333
but let's go ahead
and get started.

392
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,125
[YOSHIMURA]
We need to discuss

393
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,250
the problems unfolding
in the 11th Ward.

394
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:44,000
And then we must decide what
action Anteiku should take.

395
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,958
[YOSHIMURA]
But before we get into that,

396
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,333
let me address
Kaneki's kidnapping.

397
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,791
and what it means
for the rest of you.

398
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,333
Do yourselves a favor

399
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,666
and forget about ever
seeing him again.

400
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,291
What the hell? How could
you say such a thing?

401
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,625
[TOUKA]
Shut up!

402
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,291
Quit yelling.

403
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,083
We're going, right?

404
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,583
[NISHIKI]
To save him? Well?

405
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,125
You have to understand,

406
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,291
Aogiri Tree is a
heartless organization.

407
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,708
They are ghouls who
live to fight.

408
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,083
[YOSHIMURA] It won't be easy
to sneak into their base

409
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,166
and rescue Kaneki.
They'll do everything

410
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,875
in their power to stop us.

411
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,958
But why? That's so mean.

412
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,541
[YOSHIMURA]
And then, there's the CCG,

413
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,375
we can't ignore their movements.

414
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,916
I'm sure it's only a matter
of time before they start

415
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,750
sending their troops
to the 11th Ward

416
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,375
in the hopes of wiping
out Aogiri Tree.

417
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,041
If we try to save him,

418
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,416
there's a very good chance

419
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,083
that we'd be the ones
who end up dead.

420
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,125
We gotta do something!
We can't just abandon him!

421
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,125
He's one of us!

422
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,625
[TOUKA]
I'm going.

423
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,375
Have you forgotten
our policy, sir?

424
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,416
If you're not gonna save him...

425
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,250
...then I'll go alone.

426
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,250
I'll go with you.

427
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,541
Might as well. I owe him one.

428
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,166
[HINAMI]
I wanna help, too!

429
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,666
Kaneki's done so much for
me, it's the least I can do.

430
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,916
Just let me know how I
can help and I'll do it!

431
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,208
[TOUKA]
Hinami.

432
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,833
It appears that there's
been a misunderstanding.

433
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,791
I'm in no way abandoning Kaneki.

434
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,041
I always planned
on rescuing him.

435
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,375
[ALL gasp]

436
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,500
[YOSHIMURA] I would never
abandon a ghoul in need,

437
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,041
especially not one of our own.

438
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:35,125
That being said, I cannot
guarantee your lives.

439
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,708
If you want to save Kaneki,

440
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,208
then you have to be
willing to risk everything.

441
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,583
It will be tough.

442
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,500
But you won't be alone,
Yomo and I will protect you.

443
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,000
After all, it is
Anetiku's policy

444
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,166
to help those who are in need.

445
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,416
There's one more thing.

446
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,333
You can come in now!

447
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,125
No way! Not that bastard!

448
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,541
[TSUKIYAMA]
Amour!

449
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,208
Je le coeur brisé!

450
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,375
Imagine my horror
when I was told,

451
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,166
my best friend Kaneki's
life is in grave danger.

452
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,250
The low-life scum who
captured him must pay!

453
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,041
Yes.

454
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,750
I'll make sure of that!

455
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,000
[BANJO]
Hey Jiro.

456
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,416
Think I have a chance with Rize
or is she outta my league?

457
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,791
[JIRO] Where's this coming
from, all of a sudden?

458
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,041
Listen. If you wanna
get on her good side,

459
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,708
why don't you give
her a present?

460
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,083
Get her a present, huh?

461
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,833
I could but I don't know
what kinda stuff she likes.

462
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:57,958
And If I ask--

463
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,541
[JIRO] He's gonna
make me go ask her.

464
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,916
Ugh, what a coward.

465
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,208
[JIRO]
Excuse me, Miss Rize?

466
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,958
I have a question for you.

467
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:09,500
[JIRO] She says she likes
any and all internal organs.

468
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,958
Yeah. I should've known.

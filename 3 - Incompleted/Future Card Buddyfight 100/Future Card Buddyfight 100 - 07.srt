Taste my Dragofearless!

359
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,080
(groans)

360
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,831
End of move.

361
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,335
I'm sure Gao will find a
way to use Sith's abilities.

362
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,004
I call Cait Sith
to the center once more.

363
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,422
It's like I never left.

364
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,760
I call Carved Stallion of
Dreams, Dalahast to the left.

365
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,596
(neighing)

366
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,889
What did you do?

367
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,682
Whenever Dreams
Dalahast is called,

368
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,142
the player must
put three cards

369
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,394
from the top of their
deck into the drop zone.

370
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,021
Now, I'll pay
one gauge and call

371
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:01,317
Dashing in the Moonlight,
Red Cap to the right area.

372
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,362
From this moment on,
the stage is mine.

373
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,199
Dalahast attack
Death Shido.

374
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,368
Okay, Red Cap, now you.

375
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,703
I cast Dragonic Formation!

376
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,665
And I move Extreme Sword
Dragon to the center.

377
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,712
You'll remember the
day you got in my way.

378
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,508
Evil Dispelling
Blade Silver Exorcist!

379
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,010
Cait Sith, go
attack Death Shido!

380
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,303
(meowing)

381
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,179
No, kitty!

382
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,139
That's a bad kitty!

383
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,223
End of move.

384
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,474
I did it!

385
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,184
Your move.

386
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,478
Enjoy yourself while you
still can, fluff ball.

387
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,730
I'm going to destroy
you soon enough.

388
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,023
I draw.

389
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,733
Charge and draw.

390
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,735
I pay one gauge
and buddy call

391
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,114
Systemic Dagger Black Edge
to the right area.

392
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,657
(grunting)

393
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,242
You're close
to the edge.

394
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,744
With a buddy gift,
he regains one life point.

395
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,538
Let's use the Tako scope
to check out the stats

396
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,457
on Death Shido's monster.

397
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,418
Systemic Dagger
Black Edge.

398
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,712
Armordragon
attribute: Size One.

399
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,089
Power and defense
are both 3,000.

400
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,215
A critical of two.

401
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,510
He has one ability,
but no life link.

402
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,931
Now I call Systemic Dagger
to the center!

403
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,933
I don't need
any help from you.

404
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:20,396
(grunting, roaring)

405
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,939
He destroyed
his own monster.

406
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,609
By destroying a Systemic
Dagger Dragon on the field,

407
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,612
Black Edge is free to
unleash his true power,

408
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,821
but before that Thousand,

409
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,657
send that annoying cat
over there to the pound.

410
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,161
‐Impero Veritas!
‐Oh, not again!

411
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,163
Once again, the top
two cards from Gao's deck

412
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,789
are sent to
the drop zone.

413
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,124
We meet again, Gao!

414
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,627
(yells)

415
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,128
Black Edge,
the time has come

416
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,964
to show these numb
skulls your true power!

417
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,090
I am the greatest.

418
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,218
All others pale
in comparison to me!

419
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,510
Black Dance Macabre!

420
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,639
(shouts)

421
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,140
What's happening
down there?

422
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,310
My Tako scope show that Black
Edge has a critical of two.

423
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,020
Normally he does,
but when any card

424
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,648
with Systemic in the name
is sent to the drop zone,

425
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,317
Black Edge gains one extra
critical on that turn,

426
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,985
so his two
becomes a three.

427
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,403
Wow, that's a lot!

428
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,321
That's not all.

429
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,405
When that happens,

430
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,075
my monster also gets
the double attack ability.

431
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,534
Things aren't looking
good for Gao.

432
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,246
If he takes this hit,
he'll drop to one life point.

433
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,872
Red Cap, I owe you one.

434
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,208
I will take
this attack for you.

435
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,167
What's this?

436
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,377
Thanks to Red Cap's ability,

437
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,338
Gao has survived
the double attack.

438
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,632
By sending Red Cap
to the drop zone,

439
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,968
Gao neutralized
his opponent's attack.

440
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,052
A smart play.

441
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,012
Yeah, but he spent
the entire fight

442
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,556
hanging on
the ropes, yo.

443
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,641
This isn't the Gao
I've come to know.

444
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,811
I call Red Cap
to the center!

445
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,687
See?

446
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,522
I told you this
was my stage.

447
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,608
I cast Death Summoning
Tears of the Banshee.

448
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,027
Huh?

449
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,237
That's a very useful spell

450
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,407
that destroys one item
on the field, but...

451
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,908
It can only be
used when a player

452
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,537
has at least six fairy attribute
cards in their drop zone.

453
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,621
Wait, that's it!

454
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,124
Then explain
it to me, yo.

455
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,543
Death Shido sacrificed
Dagger once again

456
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,712
to boost
Black Edge's ability,

457
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,463
and then he called
Jamadhar Dragon

458
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,965
and destroyed Red Cap.

459
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,883
♪

460
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,427

464

Gao has only
one life left.

He's like a candle
in the wind.

466
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,895
My double attack
will finish you.

467
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,732
I cast the
Holy Grail spell.

468
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,067
Quick thinking by Gao
to use a counter spell.

469
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,986
Talk about surviving
by the skin of your teeth.

470
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,279
Why does this keep
happening to me?

471
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,406
‐Your move.
‐My turn.

472
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,532
I draw!

473
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,492
Charge and draw.

474
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,744
Ha.

475
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,664
I call Cait Sith in Boots
to the right position.

476
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,083
Like they say,
third time's the charm!

477
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,461
I can't believe you keep
using that wimpy card.

478
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,546
I think this game
is mine this time.

479
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,508
I'm going to equip
Famous Sword, Hrunting.

480
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,219
This is where the
battle really starts.

481
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,638
You're pulling out
the Gao Formation

482
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,097
at this point
in the game?

483
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,766
It's too little too late.

484
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,269
If you haven't noticed, I
have seven life points left.

485
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,687
He drew it, didn't he?

486
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,314
Oh, yeah.

487
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,108
Seems the little guy's
stronger than I thought.

488
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,320
His power, defense and
critical are fairly low values,

489
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,739
but that doesn't mean
he can't become more, bro.

491

Now, I know what
my special role is.

10 fairy attribute cards

in the drop zone,

500
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,885
Cait Sith gains
a unique ability.

Now, pay attention.

502
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,763
He's about to

00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,254
(Cait Sith sighs)

537
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,881
So, was your first
real Buddyfight

538
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,090
all you thought it'd be?

539
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,550
Boy, was it ever!

540
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,051
I've decided that
from now on,

541
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,887
you're gonna
be my buddy, Gao!

542
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,263
After all
I've done for you?

543
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,139
What do you mean?

544
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,098
I don't
have a buddy,

545
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,392
so what's
the problem?

546
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,561
‐You don't wanna?
‐That's not it.

547
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,897
You came to this world
without getting permission,

548
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,398
and you have
to go back.

549
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,234
You can't become buddies
with me or anyone else.

550
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,402
Meow?

551
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,322
The thing you have to do
is go back to Legend World,

552
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,866
and one day, someone will
draw your buddy rare card,

553
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,159
then they will
be your buddy.

554
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,119
Someone, well,
who will it be?

555
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,329
And when, meow, huh?

556
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,289
If you're lucky,
it'll happen pretty soon.

557
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,248
Lucky?

558
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,875
So it's all about
random chance?

559
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,418
Well, not exactly.

560
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,087
Luck only comes to those
who are prepared for it.

561
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,964
Some say we
create our own luck.

562
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,925
‐Isn't that right?
‐Yeah.

563
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,009
I need to be prepared?

564
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,135
But what do
I have to do?

565
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,845
You just have to
keep living your life

566
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,180
and work hard everyday.

567
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,724
If you do that, eventually
you're bound to catch a break.

568
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,268
But that could
take a long time.

569
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,311
(gasps)

570
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,230
This means you can't
run away from your job

571
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,065
and responsibilities anymore.

572
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,151
Is that why you did all this and
helped me so I'd learn that?

573
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,194
Not at all.

574
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,821
That part's
just a bonus.

575
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,406
Thank you for
everything, meow.

576
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,826
(giggling)

577
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,912
(sighs)

578
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,956
I'd better get home and
start working hard.

579
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,707
I'll see you guys
when I get my buddy!

580
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,460
So long, meow!

581
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,963
Hey, pal, there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

582
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,089
Hmm?

583
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,131
I'm just curious why

584
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,467
you decided to be
so kind to Cait Sith.

585
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,302
Well, I can
relate to the guy.

586
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,804
I mean, there
were tons of times

587
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,389
I got sick of
training every day

588
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,058
and ran away
from home too.

589
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,935
So, you're saying
that he reminded you

590
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,270
of your younger self?

591
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,771
Don't even go there.

592
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,190
But thanks to having a
father who set me straight

593
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,484
and helped me understand the
right way of doing things,

594
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,987
like working hard and
continuing my training,

595
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,239
I was able to meet
a great buddy like Gao.

596
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:49,660
Cait Sith, I'm sure you'll
meet a terrific buddy as well.

597
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,872
Welcome to Tasuku's
Buddy Police 101.

598
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,291
Today, I'm gonna teach you
about the Legend World card,

599
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,167
‐Cait Sith in Boots.
‐Cool!

600
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,712
It's a monster card that when
used under the right conditions

601
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,672
can unleash amazing power.

602
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,674
It may look weak, but
if you have ten or more

603
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,759
fairy attribute cards
in the drop zone,

604
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,553
it will increase
the critical of any item

605
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,138
you've equipped by three.

606
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,389
That's amazing!

607
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,182
So, basically, with
Cait Sith's ability,

608
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,185
any item can become as
powerful as an impact.

609
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,105
Let's add it to our
decks ASAP, meow!

610
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,189
Meow.

611
00:23:19,189 --> 00:24:47,152
♪

612
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,156
Next time, Baku and
Kuguru are possessed

613
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,952
by a 100 Demons monster named
Dekalfar Demon Swordsman, Heim.

614
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,871
He takes them hostage and
demands Tenbu in ransom.

615
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,874
Next episode, "The Demon
Swordsman Draws Closer!

616
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,126
Tenbu Abducted!"

617
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,252

He was tricked by Death Shido
and used like some puppet, yo.

542
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,345
I'm truly sorry
for what happened.

543
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,763
Don't worry about it.

544
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,432
Hey, Gramps, I thought you said
you'd remember something useful

545
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,683
if you fought against him.

546
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,436
You're right,
I did say that.

547
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,396
‐Hmm.
‐Hmm.

548
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,439
‐Nope, nothing.
‐Nope, nothing.

549
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,524
(sighs)

550
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,650
(chuckles)

551
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,027
I can't believe I actually
lost to this guy.

552
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,279
Do you have any clues for
finding your friends?

553
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,823
I was asleep for so long,

554
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,491
I don't remember
what they look like.

555
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,409

(laughing)

558
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,457
Shouldn't we have taken him
to the Buddy Card Office?

559
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,293
I mean, he is an unregistered
monster and all.

560
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,128
No, it's okay.

561
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,130
We don't have to
worry about him.

562
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,717
If it's copacetic with A‐Dog,
it's all right, yo.

563
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,469
I should be
heading home too.

Yeah, I'm beat.

565
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,223
Why don't y'all come
over for some eats?

566
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,432
I'm down with that.

567
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,892
Mind if Akatsuki comes?

forgotten something.

No, maybe not.

preventing opponents from
nullifying his attack

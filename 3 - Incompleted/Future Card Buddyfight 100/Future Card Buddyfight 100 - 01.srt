184
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,578
the world's
toughest Buddyfighter.

185
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,914
Between us dragons,
this guy's it.

186
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,790
(snickering)

187
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,458
It seems insolence
is a quality

188
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,211
even dragons have
on this planet.

189
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,838
Okay, I'll fight him.

190
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,423
My dear, just wait here.

191
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,174
This won't take long.

192
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,759
You better win, Gao!

193
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,846
I'm Gao Mikado,
the Mighty Sun Fighter.

194
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,264
Before we
start the fight,

195
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,599
tell me your name, old timer.

196
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,437
It's been many moons
since anyone has used it.

197
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,231
I forget the name
that I am called.

198
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,065
Huh?

199
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,152
Ha, I had you going
there, huh, kid?

200
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:47,986
Uh...

201
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,489
They call me Tenbu.

202
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,492
The Fifth Omni Dragon Lord.

203
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,703
Well, it's an
honor to meet you.

204
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,829
You ready?

205
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,330
Indeed I am.

206
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,207
But you'll have to
train a million years

207
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,668
before you can beat me.

208
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,172
My bravery will shine
brightly on this day.

209
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,133
Luminize, Flight Formation.

210
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,843
You wanted to use
your new powers.

211
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,970
Well, there's no time
like the present, pal.

212
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,055
Watch and learn.

213
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,058
Sculpting my body
with red hot flames,

214
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,102
carving out a new path
with my own two fists.

215
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,688
Crimson Battler,
Drum Bunker Dragon

216
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,356
is reporting for duty.

217
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,442
Wow, looks like Drum's
been working out.

218
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,070
He's trained in
the martial arts.

219
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,613
Check this out, kid,

220
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,865
my crimson fist
packs a punch.

221
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,867
Now Gao's gonna Luminize.

222
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,744
Wait till you see
how we feature

223
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,162
Drum's new abilities.

224
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,872
I built Gao
a sweet new deck.

225
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,332
I rock.

226
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,250
Burning like an inferno,

227
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,752
with limitless spirit!

228
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,214
Luminize, Crimson Dragon Fist!

229
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:53,051
What do you say,
we doin' this or what?

230
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,556
It's a monster from
a parallel world.

231
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,600
Fifth Omni
Dragon Lord, Tenbu

232
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,395
versus our very own Buddy
Police trainee, Gao Mikado!

233
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,898
Buddyfight, ha ha!

234
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,858
‐Time to raise the flag.
‐Time to raise the flag.

235
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,860
I fight for Dragon World.

236
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,947
I'm also fighting
for Dragon World.

237
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,741
And the first move
goes to Tenbu.

238
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,868
Charge and draw.

239
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,455
I call Extreme Sword
Dragon to the center.

240
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,624
Attack the fighter.

241
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,418
All right!

242
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,545
Ugh!

243
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,255
End of move.

244
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,799
Right off the bat,
Gao suffers three damage.

245
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,385
Let's see how he
answers on his move.

246
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,261
You better win this.

247
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,637
If that creep
takes me prisoner,

248
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,139
I'm coming for your dragon!

249
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,432
Come on, show some faith.

250
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,434
Draw.

251
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,354
Charge and draw.

252
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,232
I call Crimson Battler,
Extreme Blow Dragon

253
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,608
to the right.

254
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,028
Who wants to make friends
with my crimson flurry?

255
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,533
Next I call Break Shoulder
Dragon to the left!

256
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,536
In battle, there is
no need for words.

257
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:05,915
And I equip Crimson
Fist, Dragoblaze!

258
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,710
He set up an attack with
two monsters and an item.

259
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,587
And each one has
a critical of three.

260
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,797
Oh, yeah,
it's his specialty.

261
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,091
The Gao formation!

262
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,759
All right, Extreme Blow.

263
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,553
Clear out the
center for me!

264
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,471
In with a right
and a left,

265
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,681
and a right!

266
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,685
Okay, Break Shoulder, go
and attack Grandpa Tenbu.

267
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,603
Will do.

268
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,480
Now, I cast Dragon Breath.

269
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,232
(roars)

270
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,567
(belch)

271
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,986
Okay, you asked for it.

272
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,239
Ignite, my fists of fury!

273
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:42,493
Crimson Fist,
Dragoblaze!

274
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,287
End of move.

275
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,997
That's what
I'm talkin' about!

276
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,833
Gao responds by causing
three damage of his own.

277
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,585
Gao's new deck
is off the chain,

278
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,628
hey, A‐dawg?

279
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,922
Yeah, but this
Dragon Lord is no slouch.

280
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,173
The match is just beginning.

281
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,467
Tenbu calls Boomerang
Dragon to the right,

282
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,761
another Extreme Sword
Dragon to the center,

283
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,681
and Systemic Dagger
Dragon to the left.

284
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,685
Boomerang, go
attack Extreme Blow.

285
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,729
I ain't afraid of
you, kangaroo boy.

286
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,523
You're going down,
you dunny rat!

287
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,524
Argh!

288
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,526
Swing and a miss.

289
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,446
Extreme Sword,
Systemic Dagger,

290
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,698
attack the boy.

291
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,201
(Gao yells)

292
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,327
End of move.

293
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:28,915
No, Gao just suffered five
damage points in one turn!

294
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,999
Not looking good.

295
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,709
He's only got
two life left.

296
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,170
Don't worry,
Akatsuki, remember,

297
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,713
Gao's fighting
with a new deck.

298
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,175
I'm sure he has some
strategy in mind.

299
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,051
Your move.

300
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,554
I draw, charge and draw!

301
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,473
I call to the
right and left,

302
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,309
Crimson Battler,
Spin Nail Dragon!

303
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,769
I attack Extreme Sword

304
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,896
with the Spin Nail
on the right.

305
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,357
You can't
fight these nails!

306
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,610
Spinning pierce!

307
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,153
And now I attack Tenbu

308
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,198
with the Spin Nail
on the left.

309
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,409
Spinning pierce!

310
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,120
Arrgh!

311
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,746
If Gao's direct
attack hits,

312
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,916
both players will be tied
with two life points.

313
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,209
Crimson Fist!

314
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,170
No chance, I cast
Green Dragon Shield.

315
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,338
End of move.

316
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,924
I thought you were
gonna win this, Gao!

317
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,092
Instead of being tied,

318
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,343
the Green Dragon
Shield has increased

319
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,721
Tenbu's life
points to six!

320
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,431
(snickering)

321
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,809
Told you‐‐draw,
charge and draw.

322
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,853
You're finished, rookie.

323
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:32,770
(Gao growls)

324
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,856
I Buddy Call.

325
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,441
In Systemic Dagger's place,

326
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,819
I Buddy Call myself
to the center.

327
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,571
Fifth Omni
Dragon Lord, Tenbu

328
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,489
is heading into battle.

329
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,574
What on Earth's going on?

330
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,952
Agh, how could old scale
face do a self Buddy Call?

331
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,329
Isn't that against
the rules or something?

332
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,789
No, it's quite legal.

333
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,249
I assure you, my dear.

334
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,209
How about a good luck kiss?

335
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,462
Ugh, no, how about not?

336
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,630
Be warned,
for when I appear,

337
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,801
I destroy all my opponent's
monsters in the field.

338
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,305
Take this‐‐
Howling Fire.

339
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,931
I cast..

340
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,476
Gao!

341
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,686
(shouting)

342
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,855
(groaning)

343
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,857
That ability's
bad news, bro.

344
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,109
I know, destroying
all of Gao's monsters

345
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,444
just by being called.

346
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,571
Is my big brother gonna lose?

347
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,156
Why does this has
to be the first match

348
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,324
Gao ever loses?

349
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,035
I don't want to be the prize
to that creepy old dragon!

350
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,703
You know, I think
we're gonna be okay.

351
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,206
Keep it on the DL,
but Gao's already cast

352
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,582
the Skies In Your Hand spell.

353
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,918
I've never heard
of that one, yo.

354
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:37,960
Ha!

355
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,296
♪

356
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,673
I returned all of
my monsters to my hand

357
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,510
when I cast the Skies
In Your Hand spell.

358
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,012
You said your name
was Gao Mikado?

359
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,474
You are much better
than I expected.

360
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,184
But I'm not done yet.

361
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,187
Prepare for another attack!

362
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,357
I cast Blue Dragon Shield!

363
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,525

Dragon to the left.

gonna do a link attack

385

Spin Nail over there

394

I noticed Tenbu didn't
call Boomerang Dragon.

395
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,927

is no longer in his hand.

398
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,516

as much as possible.

to finish him off

403

Dragoblaze equipped.

You say penetrate?

415
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,674
Doesn't that mean
I'm gonna receive

416

Okay, then give me more,
more of your glorious power.

554
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,807
With the 100 demons
under my control,

555
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,767
I'll devour this entire world

556

Welcome to Tasuku's
Buddy Police 101.

562
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,665
Today I'm gonna teach
you about the new card,

00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,583
Gigantic Crusher.

564

Sounds fun!

565
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,585
It's a powerful impact card

566
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,670
that causes a lot of
damage to your opponent

567
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,629
in one blow.

568
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,089
If both of your
centers are open

569

fist item equipped,

570
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,385

damage to your opponent

As you can best your
opponent in one move,

574
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,017
you'll likely
win every match

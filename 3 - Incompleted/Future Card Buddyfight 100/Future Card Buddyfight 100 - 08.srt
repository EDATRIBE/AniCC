our hearts pump
and give us energy.

325

It doesn't make any sense.

542
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,364
How could Tasuku
be fighting against

543
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,991
the Purgatory Knight?

544
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,913
Welcome to Tasuku's
Buddy Police 101.

545
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,999
Today, I'm gonna teach
you all about the card

546
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,167
‐Province Baron, Shido.
‐Alright!

547
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,169
He's a tricky monster
that slips past his enemy

548
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,422
and attacks the
fighter directly.

549
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,008
His Shadow Dive ability
lets him attack your opponent

550
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,885
even if they have a
monster in the center,

551
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,177
and if he causes damage,

552
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,263
you regain one life point.

553
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,347
He kinda looks like‐‐

554
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,892
I know, he looks a
little familiar to me too.

555
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,311
Huh, must be
our imagination.

556
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,521
I'd never imagine
someone so goofy looking.

557
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,023
(laughs)

558
00:23:19,023 --> 00:24:47,027
♪

559
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,280
♪

560
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,865
Next time, Gao
learns that Tasuku

561
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,785
must defeat the monsters
in his past to find peace,

562
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,787
but what is Star Guardian,
Jackknife?

563
00:24:56,787 --> 00:25:00,541
Next episode "Crossnize!
Star Dragon World!"

(roaring)

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,173
Now that the
devastating monster

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,050
Yamigedo has been revived,

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,843
the only way to
seal him away again

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:13,138
is with the power
of the eight Omni Lords.

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,681
It's up to us
to find them.

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,725
And there's only
one way we can.

8
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,019
‐We gotta Buddyfight!
‐We gotta Buddyfight!

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,772
With a blazing fury,

10
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,482
I'm gonna track
down every last one

11
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,983
of these evil
Hundred Demons

12
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,818
and demolish them
with my fists.

13
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,112
For I am the great Ban Enma,

14
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,240
Hundred Demons hunter.

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,408
You're in a pretty
feisty mood tonight, ki.

16
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,036
I sense that we're
closing in on another one.

17
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,372
So where in the world
are we, anyway?

18
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,332
Beats me.

19
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,625
(sneezes)

20
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,418
It's terrible, chief.

21
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,461
Huh?

22
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,213
Take a look at this.

23
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,298
That Gao guy's
not doing so good.

24
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,467
Why, what happened?

25
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,095
We welcome you back now
to our introspective report

26
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,430
on the search
for the Omni Lords.

27
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,684
Following his stunt at
the Chateau de Amanosuzu,

28
00:00:58,684 --> 00:00:59,726
the mysterious Buddyfighter

29
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,604
known as Ikazuchi attacked
the Buddy Card office

30
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,730
and destroyed it.

31
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,732
Gao Mikado of the
Buddy Police Youth

32
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,943
challenged the criminal
fighter to a Buddyfight

33
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,112
but surprisingly suffered
his first ever loss

34
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,613
and the culprit escaped.

35
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,199
Gao actually lost a fight, ki.

36
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,118
(sighs)

37
00:01:16,118 --> 00:02:43,997

38
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,755
Tasuku, please come in.

39
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,632
Thank you, Mr. Mikado.

40
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,633
I can't believe it,

41
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,718

our house again.

42
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,804
How goes the search
for the Omni Lords?

43
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,306
Do you have some secret
news to share with Gao?

44
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,808
Actually, I do.

45
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,142
He's upstairs
in his room.

46
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,936
His friends
Baku and Kuguru

47
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,145
are visiting, too.

48
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,647
Is it okay
if I go up?

49
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,857
Of course, I'll
take you myself.

50
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,858
Great, thanks.

51
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,737
Gao's super busy
catching up

52
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,988
on all his schoolwork.

53
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,948
Hey, Tasuku's here!

54
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,032
‐Huh?
‐Uh.

55
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,992
Can't play with me 'cause
of your homework, huh?

56
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,661
Yeah, we're just
taking a little break.

57
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,163
It's really not at all
what it looks like.

58
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,457
The truth is, I got
bored with homework

59
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,835
and wanted to build
a new deck instead.

60
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,670
So don't be mad
at these two.

61
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,921
Oh, that's okay.

62
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,548
I might just forget
to bring you a snack

63
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,174
when I bring theirs.

64
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,511
Come on, that's not fair.

65
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,512
Hey, you guys.

66
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,721
Tasuku!

67
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,556
Everything cool?

68
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,141
What brings you here, man?

69
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,643
I just wanted to see
how you were doing, Gao.

70
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,104
(birds chirping)

71
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,695
Poor Gramps.

72
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,865
You are the reason
Tenbu's gone.

73
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:00,824
Huh?

74
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,535
That is what you're
thinking, isn't it?

75
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,871
Hey, Jack.

76
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,707
You're right,
I blame myself.

77
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:12,085
But it's not just Tenbu.

78
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,712
(gasping)

79
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,630
If what happened to
Tenbu happened to Gao,

80
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,049
I don't know
what I'd do.

81
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,552
And this Omni Lord
orb thingy or whatever

82
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,179
is no help at all.

83
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,890
I wish it would give me
a clue or something.

84
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,101
If you wish to spare Gao
from the same fate as Tenbu,

85
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,270
then you must
become stronger.

86
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,354
And you have
to be prepared

87
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,774
to protect your
Buddy at all costs.

88
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,194
It all comes down to
how badly you want it.

89
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,613
I know the fear of
losing one's Buddy.

90
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,697
Up to now,
you have embraced

91
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,200
the grueling training
required to better yourself

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,367
and your skill.

93
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,702
Continue in this way.

94
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,414
Be confident and the path
will make itself clear.

95
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,418
Thanks, Jack, you always
know what to say.

96
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,837
I'm prepared to train
as hard as I have to.

97
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,757
I also dropped by
to give you this.

98
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,675
Whoa, thanks!

99
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,261
It looks a little different
from your other one.

100
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,597
This one is
a Neo Deck Case.

101
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,599
I'm actually using
one just like it.

102
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,018
Now you're able to
Luminize again, bro.

103
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:10,894
I know, right?

104
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,103
Lets head over
to the dojo

105
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,606
and put together a
Hero World deck stat!

106
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,982
Good idea.

107
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,734
Hmm?

108
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,111
Hero World, huh?

109
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,613
(roaring)

110
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,119
Uh, can't we use any
stronger Hero cards?

111
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,329
If it's power you want,

112
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,081
I'd use that one.

113
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,208
Eh, not what
I had in mind.

114
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,626
Its defense is too low.

115
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,919
What's wrong,
it looks like

116
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,462
you're worried
about something.

117
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,964
If it's the
missing Omni Lords,

118
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,049
don't burden yourself,
we'll find them.

119
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,845
I hope so, the fate of
the world's depending on us.

120
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,638
That might be the case,

121
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:50,559
but having a purpose
keeps us sharply focused.

122
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:55,272
Huh, Rescue Dragon,
Mach Braver, huh?

123
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,398
It's a size one monster

124
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,900
that has this
super hero attribute:

125
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,986
1,000 power,
4,000 defense,

126
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,237
a critical of one,

127
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,030
and he has an ability
that activates

128
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,073
as a counterattack.

129
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,950
It's a very reliable card.

130
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,328
What does the "Rescue" part
of Rescue Dragon mean?

131
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,289
You mean you
really don't know?

132
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,748
Of course I do,

133
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,835
I'm just drawing
a temporary blank here.

134
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,629
He saves people
who are in danger.

135
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,674
That's what rescue means.

136
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,011
He rescues them, huh.

learned the word "rescue."

Yeah, like I said,

154
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,592
I just forgot
the word, is all.

155

The word and your
feelings became one,

I don't know.

160

Behind every true rescue
beats a heart of justice

others above all else.

00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,603
Sorry, chief.

550
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,480
With life link,
he receives one damage.

551
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,731
What's that ability?

552
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,609
When he destroys a monster,
he gets an extra attack.

553
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,444
That's Justice Drum for you.

554
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,279
So does it keep going
for every monster

555
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,240
that he destroys in a row?

556
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,700
At this rate,
I'll be defeated

557
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,284
in no time at all.

558
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,329
Justice Ram Bunker!

559
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,914
(yells)

560
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,959
Commander Gale, go
attack the fighter.

561
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,087
(shouting)

562
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,507
I'll clinch it
in one blow.

563
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,384
Well, Gao,
you're good.

564
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,095
Every time one of my
super hero attribute monsters

565
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,180
destroys an opponent's
monster with an attack,

566
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,224
my critical
increases by one.

567
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,768
And it increased when he
destroyed Champion Lord.

568
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,813
And it also went up one
when he took out Ricky.

569
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,232
Add it up and it makes
a critical of four.

570
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,276
Prominence Burst!

571
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:39,196

Game over.

573
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,408
Winner, Gao Mikado.

574
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,242
Thanks.

575
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244
But I owe it
all to justice.

576
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,871
You're lucky
we felt sorry for you

577
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,581
and let you win, ki.

578
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,040
Thanks for challenging me.

579
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,916
Huh?

580
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,960
You've made me feel
a lot better.

581
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,880
I just did what Yota
wasn't able to.

582
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,714
Huh?

583
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,716
I know I could
never take his place,

584
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,051
but I'd like to try
if you'll let me.

585
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:01,886
Huh?

586
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,013
Think of me as
your big brother Ban.

587
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,598
Gee, thanks Ban.

588
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,016
All right.

589

599

us why you're

600
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,790
hanging out
with that hoodlum?

601
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,917
‐Huh?
‐For once, I agree with her.

602
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,835
I guess that makes
three of us.

603

You do realize
he's interfered

604
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,089
with Buddy Police missions
in the past, right?

605
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,925
And as a member of
the Buddy Police Youth,

606
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,134

Yeah, but the fight
was really fun.

Yeah, you two did
burn it up out there.

609

You know, before
losing to Ikazuchi,

619
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,784
Gao would have
been thinking about

620
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,745
how to best use the
cards from Hero World.

621
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,747
But now it seems like
all he's talking about

622
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,542
is wanting to be
saved by a hero.

I don't think so.

625

Gao's not dealing
with the sadness

626
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,298
he feels from
losing Tenbu.

saying that by being

defeated by Ikazuchi

that he isn't even
remotely aware of it.

633
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:36,647
You know that he saved me
from the edge of despair.

1
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:03,003
(roars)

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,755
(zapping)

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,757
Now that the devastating
monster, Yamigedo,

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:10,010
has been revived, the only way
to seal him away again is with

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,012
the power of
the eight Omni Lords.

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,598
It's up to us to find them,

7
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,767
and there's only
one way we can!

8
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,394
We gotta Buddyfight!

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,146
I'll clinch it in one blow!

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,691
Well, Gao, you're good!

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,110
Every time one of my
superhero attribute monsters

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,863
destroys an opponent's monster
with an attack, my critical

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,240
increases by one.

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,034
And it increased when
he destroyed Champion Lord.

15
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,745
And it also went up one
when he took out Ricky.

16
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,331
Add it up, it makes
a critical of four.

17
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,333
Prominence Burst!

18
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,835
(agonized scream)

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,338
Game over.

20
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,340
Winner: Gao Mikado.

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,801
Thanks, but I owe it
all to justice.

22
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,022
Buddyfight Club?

23
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,858
I'm sure that
you've heard of it.

24
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,818
Of course I have,
I mean, who hasn't?

25
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,363
The illegal
underground fight club

26
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:37,491
that's always changing locations
and inviting onlookers who make

27
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,534
crazy wagers,
like double rare cards

28
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,453
or even their own
buddy monsters.

29
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,538
I loathe the very idea of it.

30
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,874
I see that I've
upset you, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,959
It's not you I'm mad at.

32
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,836
I can't stomach anyone
who would degrade

33
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,922
Buddyfighting in such a way.

34
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,215
I couldn't agree more.

35
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,966
I'm shocked
these brush events

36
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,051
actually exist.

37
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,886
I thought it was all
an urban legend.

38
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,930
For a lady with such
an upstanding position,

39
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,640
I'd be surprised if you knew.

40
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,184
We've been investigating
these scandals for many years,

41
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,812
but until now, they've...

42
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,190
they've always managed
to elude us, I'm afraid.

43
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,609
And is this tip
you received credible?

44
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,487
Mmm, in our line of work,
we are forced to treat

45
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,073
every lead the same
until proven otherwise.

46
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,159
Someone sent us coordinates
of the fight club's next event

47
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,828
and we believe
the sponsor's buddy

48
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:23,912
could be an Omni Lord.

49
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,289
What's the location?

50
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,542
Cho‐Nagoya.

51
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,002
(grunts)

52
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:38,593
Look at this; there's
an Omni Lord in Cho‐Nagoya.

53
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,971
How do you know,
what are you looking at?

54
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,223
Why is it that I'm always
the last to know what

55
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,850
you're up to anyway?

56
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,726
'Cause you're denser
than a wrecking ball.

57
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,020
She's hacked into
Amanosuzu's network.

58
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,356
Now we're able to track
the Buddy Police's progress

59
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,358
in finding the Omni Lords.

60
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,776
Huh?

61
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,611
But surely that must be illegal!

62
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,822
You really are clueless.

63
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,409
I hate it when she does that!

64
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,952
Looks like Master Ikazuchi's

65
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,246
already given her
a Hundred Demons card.

66
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,373
Doesn't need
you slowing her do‐‐

67
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,541
Hey, get back!

68
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,709
Oh, great.

69
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,003
Why does everyone
always leave me?!

70
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,549
Okay, I'm heading out
for duty, Count Dawn.

71
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,260
Before you go, I'm curious
how the Neo Deck Case

72
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,345
is working out for you.

73
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,390
So far, only you and Gao
have been issued with them.

74
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,393
It's great,
no problems at all.

75
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,395
I can fight at any time.

76
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,814
Then you are approved
for Emergency Launch.

77
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,858
Just please promise
to be careful.

78
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,068
It's possible Ikazuchi
and his cronies are using

79
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,695
the same intel.

What brings you out
to Cho‐Nagoya?

118
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,262
Nothing really, just
travelling around a bit.

119
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,847
I thought I saw
a familiar face,

120
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,682
so I came closer,
then I overheard

121
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,851
what you two
were talking about.

122
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,770
Why don't we just pretend
that you were never here?

123
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,522
Suzaku Kenron, huh?

124
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,900
They say that he's the
head of Buddyfight Club.

125
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,694
Don't tell me you
wanna come, too?

126
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,196
No true Buddyfighter
would turn down the chance.

127
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,991
I've heard that he
is exceptionally skilled

128
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,868
and that he uses
a world no one's

129
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,453
ever heard of.

130
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,246

Is that the invitation?

133
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,920

pony up more than her.

Why you‐‐

135
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,716

Okay, partner, then this

of the cards real?

Drop that invitation and leave
unless you want to get hurt.

142
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,234
You too.

143
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,402
That's enough!

144

Rouga, not you!

146
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,452
Well, this oughta be good.

147
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,790
Still taking things
by brute force, huh?

148
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,292
I guess some things
never change, do they?

149
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,420
I don't know, a lot's changed
for you lately, hasn't it?

150
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,089

Jackknife to the right.

For Peluda, it's a size one

00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,651
When those monsters are called,

157
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,071
their Thunder Mines

158
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,739

00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,432
It's getting so I
can't find a single lead.

185
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,392
I'm feeling lucky.

186
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,310
Next time we'll
find him for sure.

187
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,520
Nin, nin.

188
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,563
Argh, you've
done enough!

189
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,607
What‐‐no, wait!

190
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,114
I need to keep
my eyes peeled

191
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,116
for even the
slightest clue.

192
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,576
Huh, wait up!

193
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,120
Howdy, little dudes.

194
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,787
Huh?

195
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,539
Hey, how are you guys?

196
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,332
Ah, a girl!

197
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,458
Did you find
the Omni Lords?

198
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,876
You are still
looking for them, right?

199
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,253
Wait, what are
you doing here?

200
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,338
Don't tell me there's
one hiding at Castle.

201
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,506
(whimpers)

202
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,384
I can't reveal the
secrets of the operation.

203
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,011
Well, if you have some time,

204
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,972
how about we have
a Buddyfight?

205
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:38,143
Uh...ahem, sorry,
I can't today.

206
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,477
I'm here on
official business.

207
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,646
I came strictly
to buy some cards.

208
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,856
Oh.

209
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,857
Don't mind him.

210
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,193
That young chap's as
ill‐mannered as usual.

211
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,155
Don't be a stranger.

212
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,158
Wouldn't it be cool if
you opened up a rare card?

213
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:57,162
There's a reason they're
called rare, little brother.

214
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,622
No way!

215

♪

216
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,592
Commander I, I'm picking up
a Buddy Monster signal.

217
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,302
Really, where?

218
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,553
Just give me a second.

219
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,597
This makeshift
satellite is a little slow.

220
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,058
There, at a shopping
mall in Toshifuya.

221
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,393
Oh no, we lost the signal.

222
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,352
Perhaps we could relocate

223
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,271
to one of the
district offices?

224
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,355
Out of the question.

225
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,400

Hey, hey, hey,
it's about time

232
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,411
you opened me up.

233
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,537
Here I am
coming to you

234
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,123
from the far reaches
of coolio Katana World.

235
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,919
Put your hands together
for Zanya's Buddy.

236
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,545
Zanya's Buddy?

00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,046
Nin!

238
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,547
But I already have one.

00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,465
Nin.

240
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,716
Stop it right there,
old Buddy, old pal.

241
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,176
I can see the
wheels of confusion

242
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,469
burning rubber
in your mind.

243
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,887
You're thinking
that this average guy

244
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,388
in the black suit
is good enough.

245
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,474
Wrong, he's weak
and unreliable.

246
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,102
That's why I've come to
save you from mediocrity.

247
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,269
For a Nanomachine Ninja,

248
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,730
I'm the absolute
very best there is.

‐Nanomachine Ninja?
‐Nanomachine Ninja?

Nin.

251
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,193
Huh?

252
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,569
Big brother?

253
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,489
You got it, I'm
Nanomachine Ninja, Byakuya.

254
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,991
A.K.A, Tsukikage's
big brother.

255
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,409
All right, Junior,
now I'm here,

256
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,619
you can scram, capiche?

257
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,204
Mama needs you
back in Katana World

258
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,413
to clean the garage.

259
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,414
Nin!

260
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,666
Does he have to go?

261
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,751
It seems a little
sudden, don't you think?

262
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,585
Let's try and keep emotions

263
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,670
out of it,
shall we?

264
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,504
I get that
it's a shock,

265
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,381
really I do,
but let's face facts.

266
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,091
You want the best
Buddy there is, right?

267
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:33,925
Judge for yourself.

268
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,218
If I'm not superior
in every way,

269
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,095
I'll be the one
to leave, agreed?

270
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,596
Nin.

271
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,556
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

272
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,100
First up,
the 100 meter dash.

273
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,269
On your mark,
get set...

274
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,812
(gun shot)

275
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,105
(screeching)

276
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,440
Faster.

277
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,277
Higher.

278
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,445

00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,197
Further.

281
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,241
‐Convinced yet?
‐Nin.

282
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,742
A true ninja
must be quick

283
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,619
at gathering and
relaying information.

284
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,453
So for our next event,

285
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,747
we'll have a speed
writing contest.

286
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,790
Come on, Tsukikage.

287
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,042
He's got this
one in the bag.

288
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,420
♪

289
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,922
I'm ten times
faster than him.

290
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,048
Uh!

291
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,925
And being ninjas,
we've just got to have

292
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,135
a ninja arts contest.

293
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,970
But not just your
run of the mill kind.

294
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,305
We're Nanomachine Ninjas.

295
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,431
So prepare
for the ultimate

296
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:25,059
Nanomachine Ninja
Arts showdown!

297
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,603
Nanomachine Ninja Arts,

298
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,479
Art of Nano Nano Ni.

299
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,523
Nin.

300
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,900
Where'd they go?

301
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,359
Look down there.

302
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,737
I only see Tsukikage.

303
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,489
So where's Byakuya?

304
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,532
The Art of
Nano Nano Ni

305
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,326
is devoted to
making yourself smaller

306
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:45,163
and creating numerous
duplicates of yourself, too.

307
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,666
Looks like I win again!

308
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,626
Nin.

309
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,169
I trust this
has enlightened you

310
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,295
and helped you
to see which of us

311
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,548
is truly worthy of being
Lord Zanya's Buddy.

312
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,425
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

313
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,219
Tsukikage, make
your appropriate

314
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,845
farewells with
haste and then return

315
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,805
to Katana World
immediately.

316
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,349
We have to say
goodbye to him?

317
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,476
No fair,
I don't wanna!

318
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,519
A ninja's heart
cannot be soft.

319
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,230
Zanya deserves
the very best

320
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,105
for his Buddy.

321
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,523
No one must interfere.

322
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,444
Yeah, but we only became
Buddies with Buddy Monsters

323
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,987
so we can have
Buddyfights.

324
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,239
So shouldn't
we be testing

325
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,615
which one of
you is superior

326
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,783
through a Buddyfight?

327
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,868
You make a valid point.

328
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,663
Akatsuki, you take
Tsukikage as your Buddy,

329
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,623
Zanya and I will
fight against you.

330
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,667
Then we'll see
who's the best.

331
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,669
But he's all I know.

332
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,379
Don't worry,
it's the only way.

333
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,422
Whoever wins will
become your Buddy.

334
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,548
We shuffle.

335
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,633
This is all so weird,

336
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,760
but I guess at the very
least it will be interesting

337
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,929
to see what kind
of monster he is.

338
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,104
(cell phone ringing)

339
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,982
Hey, I just got
a text from Kazane.

340
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,400
Huh, get this.

341
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,277
She says that
Zanya and Akatsuki

342
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,778
are going to
have a Buddyfight.

343
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,738
Keeping it all
in the family, hey bro?

344
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,699
We've all got to go
and check this out.

345
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,867
Yeah, count me in.

346
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,994
Wherever there's
a Buddyfight,

347
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,996
you'll find me,
Paruko Nanana.

348
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,330
Today we have
a special treat.

349
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,291
A Kisaragi showdown
between brothers

350
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,458
Zanya and Akatsuki.

351
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,585
I've got to do this
for Tsukikage.

352
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,587
I won't lose
no matter what.

353
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,423
All right, Zanya,
what do you say?

354
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,425
Let's show that uppity
little brother of mine

355
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,176
what it's like playing
with the grownups,

356
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,136
shall we?

♪

358
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,140
Zanya has the first move.

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,766
Hey, guys, over here.

360
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,519
Good timing, it's
just about to start.

361

I call Yumi Ninja, Suiha
to the center area.

I have trained
for such a day.

363

544
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:50,648
Nin.

545
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,317
But he went along
with the fight.

546
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,735
Mmm.

547
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,195
Even if you didn't
agree right away,

548
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,822
it's as clear as
the nose on your face

549
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,990
which of us is more
worthy of being your Buddy.

550
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,659
Now, let's go
start the process

551
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,494
for switching me
over as your Buddy.

552
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,662
What do you say, 'kay?

553
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,248
While it is true that you
are an excellent monster...

554
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,249
Yes, and...?

555
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,168
See, the thing is, you
have one glaring flaw.

556
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,254
That's absurd, what
are you talking about?

557
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,005
You talk way too much!

558
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,048
Ah!

559
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,508
‐Uh.
‐Uh.

560
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,051
You make me feel
as uncomfortable

561
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,845
as I do around girls!

562
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,430
And do you know
why that is?

563
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,348
Because they're
chatterboxes!

564
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,391
Girls talk too much.

565
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,643
They go on and on and on
about nothing meaningful

566
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,187
and they never listen
to a single word you say!

567
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,689
I know, I hate that!

568
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:32,523
Nin.

569
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,691
You don't listen either!

570
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,359
You actually thought
that rhinoceros

571
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,862
was the First Omni Beast Lord!

572
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,114
Yeah, that wasn't
my best moment.

573
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,949
Those who talk too
much are not suited

574
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,242
for being my Buddy.

575
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,869
Meaning that I'll
be more troubled

576
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,412
if you become my Buddy.

577
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,956
But I'm the better,
stronger ninja!

578
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,251
Tsukikage's the
only Buddy for me.

579
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,255
Now and forever,
we share a bond.

580
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,883
I knew it the
moment we first met.

581
00:20:58,883 --> 00:20:59,925
We were fated.

582
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,801
We chose each other

583
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,387
and have been best
friends ever since.

584
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,889
Nin.

585
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,600
Hooray, now we can
all be together!

586
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,268
I'm so happy
you can stay

587
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,394
and won't have
to leave us.

588
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,520
Nin!

589
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,607
But then why was
my card opened?

590
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,568
If you're interested,

591
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,862
I'd really like it if you'd
become part of my deck.

592
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,740
To be honest, I could
use your strength.

593
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,284
Of course, I'd do anything
to help you, Zanya.

594
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,286
I'd climb mountains,
swim oceans,

595
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,996
walk through fire,
fend off‐‐

596
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:33,375
Just try not to
talk so much, okay?

597
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,460
Nin.

598
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,379
Cool, now the two brothers
get to fight side by side!

599
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,464
Nin.

600
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,508
From now on, I'll obey
your orders, big brother,

601
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,135
and do everything in
my power to help us win.

602
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,428
Big brother?

603
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,597
I thought Tsukikage
was your younger brother.

604
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,724
I guess it can be
confusing for you humans

605
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,935
who are obsessed with
chronological order.

606
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,812
But in the world of
Nanomachine Ninjas,

607
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,313
the superior
ninja is always

608
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,273
referred to as
the big brother,

609
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,775
regardless of birth order.

610
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,318
If you must know,
I was actually born

611
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,278
after Tsukikage,
but by choosing him

612
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,112
as your preferred Buddy,

613
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,989
I am automatically
now the little brother.

614
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,699
I don't really mind,
in the end it's best

615
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,284
for brothers
to get along.

616
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,494
I couldn't agree more.

617
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,037
I guess we should do the same.

618
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,372
Yeah, we got
to work together

619
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,581
and stop fighting.

620
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,126
Come on, let's go find the
First Omni Beast Lord, Ziun!

621
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,463
♪

622
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,841
(chuckle)

623
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,301
It turns out that the
monster spotted in Choguma

624
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,636
isn't an Omni Lord after all,

625
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:26,971
just a registered monster.

626
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,931
It was mistakenly
reported as a possible

627
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,307
because of its horns.

628
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,642
We've got to
keep searching.

629
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:35,020
Okay, report back to base.

630
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,356
Why don't we take
a little detour first?

631
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,984
Let me guess, you want
to check in on Gao.

632
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:40,818
Yeah, Jack.

633
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,444
He can probably
use a friend.

634
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,112
I'm worried about him

635
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,239
after dropping
his first fight.

636
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:53,163
Welcome to Tasuku's
Buddy Police 101.

637
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,498
Today I'm gonna
teach you all about

638
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,458
Nanomachine Ninja, Byakuya.

639
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,251
I'm all ears!

640
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,294
He destroys his enemies

641
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,422
with the skillful
Nanomachine Clone Exterminate.

642
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,173
Each time you discard
a non‐monster card

643
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,842
from your hand,
he can attack again.

644
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,343
And he has Shadow
Dive ability,

645
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,013
which lets him blow past
an opponent's center monster.

646
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,014
That's awesome!

647
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,850
He works well with
Water Slash Sword, Murasame,

648
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,435
which can return
from the drop zone

649
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,352
to your hand.

650
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:19,064
Wish I could
return home to bed.

651
00:23:19,064 --> 00:24:48,404
♪

652
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,741
Next time, Gao's taken by
the Hundred Demons hunter

653
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,035
and he's forced to
compete in a Buddyfight.

654
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,121
I can't leave my
Buddy on his own,

655
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,289
so I power up
to lend a hand.

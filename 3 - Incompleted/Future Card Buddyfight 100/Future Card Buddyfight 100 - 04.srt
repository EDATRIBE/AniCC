1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,129
Buddyfight uses special
cards that act as portals

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,381
to bring monsters from
other worlds to Earth

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,175
to become buddies with humans.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,219
But now, a swarm
of evil monsters,

5
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,553
known as the Hundred Demons,

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,806
have come here illegally and
plan to destroy the planet.

7
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,975
It's time for an
Emergency Launch.

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,560
Buddy Skill on!

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,479
(whooshing)

10
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,483
♪

11
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,319
All right, I opened
the Blue Dragon Shield!

12
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,570
Whoa, that's awesome!

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,988
Those are hard to find.

14
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,240
So what?

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,200
It's not like
it's a Super Rare.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,369
Okay, so what did
you get then, huh?

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,204
I don't know,
I'm not really sure.

18
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,831
It's okay, we all have
to start somewhere.

19
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,751
Just read the cards and
tell us what they say.

20
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,877
I know how to play.

21
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,921
I just never
opened cards before.

22
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,674
Let me just take
a look at one.

23
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:49,967
What, no way!

24
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,760
Come on, unreal.

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,844
Beginner's luck.

26
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,348
Uh, you mean I
drew a good card?

27
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,850
Good, it's the same
one as Gao's buddy.

28
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,978
You're not in the
special Buddyfight class,

29
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,771
but you and Gao do
have homeroom together.

30
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,023
You must have heard
about Drum by now.

31
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,985
That's a great card, seriously.

32
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,027
Hm.

33
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,739
The same card as Gao's buddy.

34
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,241
Excellent.

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,507
How long do you
expect me to wait, huh?

36
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,300
I'm sorry, but
the last failure

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,344
wasn't my fault, Master.

38
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,137
Sophia and Gallows over there

39
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,682
are the ones that lost
to Gao Mikado this time.

40
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,808
Hey.

41
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,560
So if you want to punish
someone, punish them!

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,437
‐Enough!
‐Ah!

43
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,690
I'm sorry, please
don't hurt me!

44
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,317
(laughing)

45
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,237
I'm growing tired of
your sniveling excuses.

46
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,615
This is your last chance
to redeem yourself.

47
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,492
Awaken, power of darkness,

48
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,037
power of evil, power
of the Hundred Demons!

49
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,372
Pleased to meet you.

50
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,960
My name's Kalavinka
Uguisukomachi, chirp.

51
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,671
This Hundred Demon doesn't
look nearly as strong

52
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:33,630
as the last two.

53
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,592
Use this monster
to bring Tenbu to me

54
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,136
so I can devour him.

55
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,471
Yes, as you wish, Master!

56
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,682
Well, what are
you waiting for?

57
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,183
Be gone!

58
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,309
You're joking!

59
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,146
That is a long time
without a day off.

60
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,814
It's very troubling.

61
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,023
No matter how busy,

62
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,067
our officers need
sufficient rest.

63
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,111
Your superior
sounds incompetent.

64
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,696
With people like
this running things,

65
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,866
the Buddy Police's future
looks very dark indeed.

66
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,033
(grunts)

67
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,411
‐Gao.
‐Huh?

68
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,871
Go take three days off.

69
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,831
We can manage things here.

70
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,124
Are you sure?

71
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,669
Sometimes resting your body
is an important mission too.

72
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,962
(laughs)

73
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,338
You heard him.

74
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,382
Now, you should get going

75
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,594
and spend time being
a kid for a change.

76
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,722
Now what do we do?

77
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,099
I'm not used to
having any free time.

78
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,434
After grabbing some za,

79
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,811
why don't we check
out the Buddy Fest?

80
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,147
Oh, is that today?

81
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,940

Thanks for comin'!

86

Buddyfight newbies out there.

It's exactly what
I've always wanted.

This place is jam‐packed, wow.

97
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,438
Okay, so all of you who
want your chance to play,

98
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,649
‐raise your hand.
‐What is this I'm hearing?

99
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,943
Buddyfighting takes
time to perfect.

100
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,069
‐It's a skill.
‐What do you think

101
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,111
you're doing, Gramps?

102
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,155
You can't just pop out
whenever you want.

103
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,241
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

That's the Lord Tenbu
card right under my nose.

106
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,456
We should take advantage of
this unexpected opportunity.

107
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,416
You're not the one
in charge here.

108
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,461
Hang on, I think we have a
celebrity here with us today.

109
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,256
Don't look now, but it's the
famous Buddy Police trainee,

110
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,757
Gao Mikado!

111
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,259

Hey!

This is awesome, dude.

116
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,393
Would you like, you know,
wanna help us train

117
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,979
‐some of these guys?
‐Uh, I don't know.

118
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,522
Sure he would.

119
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,481
What are you doing?

120
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,941
It'll be a good time.

121
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,443
Besides, what else
ya got goin' on?

122
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,320
Yeah, you're right.

123
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,905
Okay then, I'm in.

124
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,115
So what do I do?

125
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,992
Wow, who would
like to challenge

126
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,827
the Castle Store Manager?

127
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,370
Gao's agreed to be
in your corner

128
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,831
for a hands‐on
Buddyfight training match.

129
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,124
Hey, go for it.

130
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,543
You'll never get another
chance like this, Tatsuto.

131
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,753
Uh, I can look up
the rules on my own

132
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,422
if I want to, thanks.

133
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,673
Aw, come on!

134
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,093
You can use your new
Crimson Battler, Drum.

135
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,511
What, no way.

136
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,804
Yeah, so what?

137
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,347
Who are you, what do you care?

138
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,974
Hey, Gao, you'll never guess!

139
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,436
This guy beside me has a
Crimson Battler, Drum card!

140
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,104
Cool, hey, Tatsuto.

141
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,106
Oh, hey there, Gao.

142
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,691
How are you?

143
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,985
We found our challenger!

144
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,696
I won't be much
of a challenge.

145
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,822
You'll be just fine.

146
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,950
We both start out with ten
life points, little dude.

147
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,994
Okay, let's get
started already!

148
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,704
Ah, but I haven't
had a chance

149
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,289
to learn the
rules yet, ma'am.

150
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,957
Relax, don't worry about it.

151
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,959
It's way easier
to learn the rules

152
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,336
when you're playing anyway.

153
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,172
Okay, everyone,
say it with me now!

154
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,257
Buddy...

155
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,008
Fight!

156
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,469
Time to raise the flag.

157
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,264
I'm fighting for Hero World.

158
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,350
Uh, what do I do now?

159
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,768
Flip this.

160
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,188
We're fighting
for Dragon World.

161
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,066
Normally, we place our
buddy cards right here,

162
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,734
but since this is
a training game,

163
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,861
we won't be using
buddies today.

164
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,780
Why don't we play
Rock, Paper, Scissors

165
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,239
to see who goes first?

166
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,407
Rock, paper...

167
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,076
‐Scissors.
‐Scissors.

168
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,535
Scissors cuts paper.

169
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,912
That means we go first.

170
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,414
To start, choose any
monster you'd like to play

171
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,917
from the cards in your hand.

172
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,753
Mm, how about this one?

173
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,713
That's the Hammer Ball Dragon.

174
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,589
Awesome choice!

175
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,424
So, where do you
want to put him?

176
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,592
I think center.

177
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,344
This guy has a
critical of two,

178
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,597
which means he'll do two
damage to your opponent.

179
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,684
Ah‐ha‐ha, covering
your center, huh?

180
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,268
Pretty good strategy, dude.

181
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,270
Now, just turn
the card sideways

182
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,689
and announce your attack.

183
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,982
Mm, okay.

184
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,070
I use Hammer Ball Dragon to
attack Castle Store Manager.

185
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,446
Ah!

186
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,409
Oh, no, you just took
two of my life points.

187
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,786
The player who goes first
can only attack once.

188
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,789
At the end of each turn,
we say, "End of move."

189
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,624
Cool, that makes it my go.

190
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,210
Now, to begin each
turn, we draw a card.

191
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,796
That means I take the card
that's on top of my deck

192
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,006
and then add it to
the cards in my hand.

193
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,343
After that, I take one
card that I don't need

194
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,636
and add it to my gauge.

195
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,471
This lets me draw
from my deck again.

196
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,057
You can do this during
your first turn, too.

197
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,060
And we call it
"charge and draw."

198
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,937
Okay, what's gauge exactly?

199
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,690
When you play stronger cards,
you gotta pay a cost.

200
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,608
We use the gauge
to make payments.

201
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,651
Here I go.

202
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,862
I call Rescue
Dragon, Crossbuster

203
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,488
to the right position.

204
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,366
And then I call Cyber
Police, Hyper Rescue

205
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,827
to the center area.

206
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,995
He called two at once.

207
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,205
Yeah, you see, monsters
have different sizes.

208
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,499
If the total they add
up to is three or less,

209
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,001
you can call as
many as you like.

210
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,462
And even if you have a size
three out in the field,

211
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,672
you're allowed to call
a size zero monster.

212
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,507
Now, attack!

213
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,676
These monsters have
criticals of three and one

214
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,970
which means that I'll
receive four damage.

215
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,765
Nah, don't forget,
on your first turn,

216
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,183
you put a monster in
the center, right?

217
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,853
So as long as he stays there,
you won't receive any damage.

218
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,021
He'll protect you.

219
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,022
That's right, Gao,

220
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,274
which is why I'm gonna
use my Hyper Rescue

221
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,359
to attack your
Hammer Ball Dragon.

222
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,236
Ha‐ha!

223
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,697
Oh no, what do I do now?

224
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,199
When monsters
fight each other,

225
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,493
you gotta check out their
power and defense stats

226
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,869
'cause if your
monster's defense

227
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,163
is lower than your
opponent's monster's power,

228
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,915
your monster
will be destroyed.

229
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,792
Now that there's
no one protecting you,

230
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,835
my attacks will
reach you directly.

231
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,878
Za‐zing!

232
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,631
I'm gonna use Crossbuster
to attack the fighter.

233
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,216
With no monster
in the center,

234
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,052
Tatsuto receives
three damage.

235
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,512
Takochu.

236
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,014
And with that,
it's end of move.

237
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,849
Your turn, Tatsuto.

238
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,851
Draw.

239
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,187
And I charge and draw.

240
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,232
Whoa, Assail Sword,
Dragoraptor.

241
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,776
But it's not a monster,
so what do I do with it?

242
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,530
It's an item card which means
that you yourself can fight.

243
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,533
You're expecting me to fight
in my very first game?

244
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,411
Sure, just pay two gauge
and put the card right here.

245
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,915
Okay, I equip Assail
Sword, Dragoraptor.

246
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,625
And items aren't
limited by size,

247
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,710
so you can call
another monster.

248
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,088
Then I call three
size one monsters.

249
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,132
Hang on, man.

250
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,925
If you do that, you can't use

251
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,094
the Dragoraptor
you just equipped

252
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,345
'cause when you've
got a monster

253
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,014
in the center position,
you aren't able to attack.

254
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,891
He's kind of blocking you in.

255
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,560
Think about it, you
don't want to attack

256
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,562
your own monster
in the back, do ya?

257
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,021
Then I'll leave
the center open

258
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,149
and call Hammer Ball
Dragon to the right

259
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,152
and I call Starting Dragon
to the left position.

260
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,612
Hey, you just set up
the Gao Formation.

261
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,947
I did, what's that?

262
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,533
Why don't we leave
that for another time?

263
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,326
Ha‐ha, it looks good,

264
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,745
but you won't be able to
break through my center.

265
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,624
Don't forget, my Hyper
Rescue has 6,000 defense.

266
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,127
Hammer Ball has 5,000 power

267
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:13,006
Starting and Dragoraptor
have only 4,000 each.

268
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,382
It's impossible.

269
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,176
There's always a link attack.

270
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,510
You'll have to explain that.

271
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,596
If you make two attacks
at the same time,

272
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,806
you can unite their
power together.

273
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,892
How much do you get if
you add up Hammer Ball

274
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,602
and Starting's
combined power?

275
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,145
Nine thousand power.

276
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,355
Then we can defeat
Hyper Rescue.

277
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,565
(crying)

278
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,275
Hyper Rescue's
been destroyed.

279
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,361
Now I'll attack store
manager with Dragoraptor.

280
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,447
Take that!

281
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,657
‐Ah!
‐That's three more damage

282
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,326
to the Castle Store Manager!

283
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,370
For a first‐timer,
Tatsuto's running the show.

284
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,166
I'll get Uguisukomachi to
possess Paruko and steal Tenbu.

285
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,543
♪

286
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,004
Ah.

287
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,381
I understand.

288
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,425
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

289
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,599
Hm.

290
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,683
Are you okay?

291
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,018
Takochu?

292
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,020
Is this part of the game?

293
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,522
I'm feeling better
than ever, actually.

294
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,483
I just thought our
young friend here

295
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,692
could use a breather.

296
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,610
Chirp, chirp.

297
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,820
Something is quite
different about you,

298
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,821
but for the life of me

299
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,365
I just can't put
my claw on it.

300
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,366
Give me a break.

301
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,201
You can't just keep
popping out like this.

302
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,371
Right, you know
how my memory is.

303
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,039
Since we're taking
a little break,

304
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,375
can I have a look at
that Tenbu card of yours?

305
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,627
You're a Hundred Demon.

306
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,420
What's that?

307
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,590
No, I'm not a
Hundred Demon, chirp.

308
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,759
Paruko would never do that,

309
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,719
put down her
microphone during a fight

310
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,681
to try and look at
someone's cards.

311
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,724
Why, you, you leave
me no choice.

312
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,101
I'll have to
take it by force.

My best chance is to put

00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,176
Anyone going to tell
me what's going on?

358
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,553
Sorry you got dragged
into this, man.

359
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,847
I don't really know
what's going on either,

360
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,101
but it's clear I gotta win
if we want to go home.

361
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:56,395
Well, I'll just stand over
here and cheer you on.

362
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,939
Thanks, I might need it.

363
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,065
'Kay, hurry this up.

364
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,483
We want to get
back to Castle.

365
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,901
If you think you can beat me,

366
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,070
you're a hundred
years too soon.

367
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,364
I must say, it's
much more relaxing

368
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,825

from the Skull Pit.

369
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,034
Charge and draw.

370
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:14,038
I call Crimson Battler, Guns
Knuckle Dragon to the center.

371
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,290
I'm gonna pump
you full of lead.

372
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,751
Attack the fighter!

373
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,628
My pickle's in a barrel!

374
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,380
Chirp, chirp!

375
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,173
End of move.

376
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,509
So this is a Buddyfight.

377
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,718
Your move.

378
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,555
Draw.

379
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,639
Charge and draw.

380
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,350
I call Blood Knife,
Kimensai to the left

381
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,563
and Sea‐splitting Irukamaru
to the center, chirp.

382
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,648
(laughing)

383
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,026
(laughing)

384
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,904
And now I buddy call
myself to the right,

385
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,906
regaining one life point.

386
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,366
Takochu.

387
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,120
You don't need the Takoscope.

388
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,746
I'll tell you
about it myself.

389
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,457
I'm a size one monster
with 3,000 power,

390
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,002
5,000 defense, and
a critical of one.

391
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,629
And my ability is
elegant Double Attack.

392
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,965
And you're actually a dude.

393
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,884
You talk too much!

394
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,137
Kimensai, destroy
Mr. Knuckles in the center.

395
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:15,016
Ha‐ha, sword of
devilish delight!

396
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,017
Ah!

397
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,352
(laughing)

398
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,395
Penetrate!

399
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,813
(grunting)

400
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,691
Called from the icy depths,
sword of the thrashing seas!

401
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,153
Take this Flaming
Arrow Bushfire Blitz.

402
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,155
(grunting)

403
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,783
I'm not done yet!

404
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,785
Say bye‐bye to one
more life point.

405
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,663
(grunting)

406
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,040
End of move.

407
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,458
Thanks to my Double Attack,

408
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,211
your life points have been
cut down to half, chirp.

409
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,379
On my next turn,
I'll end this battle.

410
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,632
(chirping)

411
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,800
She's making my
dragon blood boil.

412
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,345
When I'm called, I'll
sweep you into oblivion

413
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,763
with my howling fire.

414
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,349
That Uguisukomachi's
actually not half bad.

415
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,352
Maybe for once you'll get
something right, Sh‐Shids.

416
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,354
Master Ikazuchi
will be so happy

417
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,813
he won't zap me this time.

418
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,733
Well, you didn't actually do
anything, did you, ka‐sha?

419
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,817
Zip those bony lips.

420
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,196
My underling's success
counts as my success.

421
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,281
Time for the Gao Formation.

422
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,282
Isn't that...

423
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,785
Yeah, better start
taking notes, kid.

424
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,328
Monster under fire!

425
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,038
Ah!

426
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,333
‐Penetrate.
‐Chirp, chirp!

427
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,376
Crimson Fist!

428
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,128
I cast Demon Way,
Oborogenbu.

429
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,338
Ugh, dang!

430
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,257
Your attack's
been neutralized.

431
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,301
Yeah, then I'll get Spin
Nail to attack the right.

432
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,554
Spinning pass!

433
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,223
I must fly away for now!

434
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,683
End of move.

435
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:42,061
Gao figured out early this
game isn't just about power.

436
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,563
It's about staying positive.

437
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,064
Even when things
look hopeless,

438
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,691
Gao always keeps battling

439
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,484
till he figures
out a way to win.

440
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,028
Set spell Return
to the Underworld,

441
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,697
and I choose to
activate it now

442
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,449
and call myself to
the center, chirp.

443
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,201
As a size one Skull Warrior,

444
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,996
I can use this spell
to resurrect myself.

445
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,206
I call Tempest
Garo‐oh to the right

446
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,208
and I activate his ability.

447
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,668
(shouting)

448
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,712
Go take a bite
out of the fighter.

449
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,340
I cast Green Dragon Shield!

450
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,466
No problem.

451
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,302
Garo‐oh, again!

452
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,805
My Garo Slash!

453
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,224
Gao, isn't it my
turn to fight yet?

454
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,436
I'll engulf those monsters
and peck them out for good.

455
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:28,065
Like a Katana candle, I'll
light them up on both ends!

456
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,400
End of move.

457
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,360
All Gao's monsters
have been destroyed.

458
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,653
Stay calm, kid.

459
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,905
This is where the
fight gets real.

460
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,949
Now who's the teacher, huh?

461
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,077
Let's do this, partner.

462
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,038
What am I, chopped liver?

463
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,332
I draw!

464
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,791
Charge and draw!

465
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,503
Time to send this
bird back to the nest.

466
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,963
Buddy call Crimson Battler,

00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,090
Drum Bunker Dragon
to the right.

468
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,760
Sculpting my body
with red‐hot flame,

469
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,554
carving out a new path
with my own two fists.

470
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,475
Crimson Battler, Drum Bunker
Dragon is reporting for duty.

471
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,101
Why did he call
him to the right?

472
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,103
Gao only has
four life points.

473
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,522
Shouldn't he be called to
the center to protect them?

474
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,193
I mean, he could be defeated
on Uguisukomachi's next turn.

475
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,612
Thrill Ram Break!

center position, gah.

Kid's right.

537

Being positive
is where it's at,

538
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,177
not just for this game, but
for life in general, dudes.

Hey, look, isn't that Tatsuto?

542
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,852
Ha, whatever.

543
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,604
Stop your blabbing
and call a monster

544
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,022
to the center already.

545
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,941
You're gonna need
protection, rookie.

546
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,945
I equip Assail
Sword, Dragoraptor!

547
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,697
And, now, I buddy call...

...Crimson Battler, Drum
Bunker Dragon to the right!

549
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,955
‐Come on!
‐That's it.

550
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,623
Huh?

Gao speaking.

552

Gao, another illegal monster
has been reported in the city.

553
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,713
He was last seen
around the Sky Tower.

554
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,632
I'm sorry to bother
you on your day off,

555
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,801
but could you head to
the scene right away?

556
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,136
No problem.

557
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,764
Drum, Buddy Police
Emergency Launch.

558
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,975
So much for our
day off, huh?

559
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,726
Fine with me.

Crimson Battler,
Drum Bunker Dragon.

569
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,919
‐Cool!
‐This is Drum so souped up,

570
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,505
he can destroy a monster with
a single blow of his fist.

571
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,841
And if you happen to have
a Fist item equipped,

572
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,801
he gains the ability
to Penetrate,

573
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,511
so you can cause
damage to the fighter

574
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,971
while keeping
your center open.

575
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,180
That's my kind of card.

576
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,516
He also has Soulguard,
so destroying him once

577
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,475
won't keep him down.

578
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,311
He's a really
powerful monster.

579
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,521
Let me out early so I
can go try and open one.

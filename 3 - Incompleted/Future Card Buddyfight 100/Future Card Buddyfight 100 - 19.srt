becoming a nice guy.

Aw, get out of here.

Thanks a lot, Jin.

184

You in here,
Lord Ziun?

He's not home.

189

to wait 'til he comes back.

The forecaster of
disaster is on the case!

193
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,964
I secretly attached one
of my clones to Lord Ziun

194
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,299
to track his every move,

195
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,092

him right now.

196
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,510
Hold your tongues in silence

197

in on his exact location,

Zing!

Like hounds on a scent, we
go down this mountain path

and take a sharp right
onto the paved road.

202
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,691
Then, we merge onto the
busy four lane highway

203
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,527

once we spot the ocean,

204

along the seaside road

Oh, I see.

Is that where Lord Ziun
is right now?

208
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,204
Don't tell me that you put a
clone on him too, Tsukikage.

What was the point then?

I thought you came here

225

to another Buddyfight.

is to wait

in the hot springs.

A few more minutes won't
make much difference.

229

Okay, but you need him to agree
to join your deck, right?

230
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,046
So, why not hurry it up
and Buddyfight him already?

You've got it all
wrong, little brother.

Yes, I'm well aware.

313

What's happening so far?

314
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,370
On the first move, Zanya called
Yumi Ninja, Suiha to the center.

315
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,497
He then added
Byakyua from his deck

316
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,750
to the cards in his hand
and attacked the fighter

317
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,877
causing two damage,
and he just set

318
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,880
his Super Lethal Formation
before you came in.

319
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,548
(both gasp)

320
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,800
Ziun's up, and he
calls two monsters.

321
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,968
I wonder what he'll do.

322
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:04,969
Let's watch!

323
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,139
Dokakusai, Irukamaru,
attack the fighter.

to the point!

thrashing seas!

00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,110
At the end of the turn,

328
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,738
Dokakusai goes directly
to the drop zone.

329
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,198
Who knows when
I'll be back?

330
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,908
End of move.

00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,786
Your move.

332
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,871
That fight with Ziun
taught me something.

333
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,791
You see, I tried so hard to
impress him with my strength

334
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,168
that I stopped
being a Buddy Cop.

335
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,670

could have won like that.

336

what I need to do.

337
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,717
Okay, Z, now I see
what you meant.

338
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,304
The same is true for us.

339
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,431
Really, how so?

340
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,226
We were also guilty of only
trying to show our strength

341
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,269
and we forgot what
was truly important.

342
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,314
Like you, this prevented us from
fighting to our full potential.

Nin.

344
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,691
Hmm.

345
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,443
After hearing what
your friend, Jin said,

346
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,362

Together, we'll

532
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,923
What's wrong,
I don't get it.

533
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,800
Is everything okay, kid?

534
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,801
It's weird.

535
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,303
The deck won't fit
inside the case.

536
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:30,307
I'm afraid Tasuku's
fears were correct.

537
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,060
If that's the case,
then I fear that Gao

538
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,605
may be unable to use
Dragon World decks anymore.

539
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,815
Darn it!

540
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,316
Why won't it fit?

00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,860
Huh?

you feeling okay?

Welcome to Tasuku's
Buddy Police 101.

Today's subject is the Ghoul
Deity, Gojinmaru card.

Lay it on me!

550
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,129
It was created by Tsukikage
and Byakyua combining

551
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,505
and then further evolving.

552
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,507
It's called when both
monsters are in the field,

553
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,800
then put in its soul.

554
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,011
The Shadow Dive and
Double Attack abilities

555
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,221
make it an extremely
powerful card.

556
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,347
I'll say!

557
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,850
Gojinmaru also has
a Move and Soul Guard

558
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,602
to defend you on
your opponent's turn.

559
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,020
Sounds like the
perfect monster!

560
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,813
Kind of like Drum

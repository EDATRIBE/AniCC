1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,377
Buddyfight
uses special cards

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,337
that act as portals

3
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,547
to bring monsters from
other worlds to Earth

4
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,716
to become
buddies with humans.

5
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,259
But now, a swarm
of evil monsters

6
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,053
known as the
Hundred Demons

7
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,012
have come
here illegally

8
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
and plan to
destroy the planet.

9
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,308
It's time for
an Emergency Launch.

10
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,310
Buddy Skill on.

11
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,357
Let's have a
snapping good time!

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,568
I'd never let you get
your grubby mitts on me.

13
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,488
I cast Great
Pillar of Fire!

14
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,281
What?

15
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,408
(cough)

16
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,827
Crimson Fist,
Dragoblaze!

17
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,954
Aaah!

18
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,457
(sinister laughing)

19
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,502
Now I cast
Quiescence of Cassiade!

20
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:44,670
Now any
damage I receive

21
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,463
is reduced by
three whole points.

22
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,050
Uh, oh.

23
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,344
You okay?

24
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,804
Get a hold
of yourself, kid.

25
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,014
Come on,
stand up, Gao!

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,152
Count Dawn,
it's your move.

27
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,655
I'm going to
activate my ability.

28
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,408
I pay one life and revive
myself to the right.

29
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,993
Let twilight return.

30
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,162
That's right,
Count Dawn can revive

31
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,622
if the player
pays one life

32
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,332
at the beginning
of the turn.

33
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,543
I call Wolfman, Gutz
to the center position.

34
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,671
♪

35
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,755
Let's do it.

36
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,299
I'll send my double
in to attack first.

37
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,301
Deluxe Column!

38
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,679
Arrgh, arrgh!

39
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,805
(giggle)

40
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,099
This will be easier
than I thought, Bia.

41
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,600
I cast Check It Out.

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,435
Guess that's
last call.

43
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,311
That's a counter spell

44
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,562
that returns all
monsters in the field

45
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,730
to each player's hand,

46
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,315
and lets the
player using it

47
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,734
call one
to the center.

48
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,153
I call Mysterious
Decarabia to the center.

49
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,072
The buddy gift gives
her one life point.

50
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,658
It's time to solve
Decarabia's mystery.

51
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,327
My Takoscope will
give us the 411.

52
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,455
Mysterious Decarabia
72 Pillars attributes,

53
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,250
size two, 6,000 power,
3,000 defense,

54
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,334
and a critical of two.

55
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,336
And when it
appears on the field...

56
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,797
We're going to play
rock, paper, scissors, Bia.

57
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,840
Rock, paper...

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,550
Huh?

59
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,801
Scissors.

60
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,595
Scissors.

61
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,514
I win, which means
I get to destroy

62
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,974
one of your cards
in the field.

63
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,393
I underestimated
her powers, for sure.

64
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,937
Arrgh!

65
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,694
Here in the
Darkness Barrier,

66
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,863
things are going
from bad to worse.

67
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,864
Gao was forced
to choose a card

68
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,824
after Death Shido
cast Dangerous Fuse

69
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,994
and increased his
gauge by two points.

70
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,328
(groaning)

71
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,040
Buddy call Iron
Cyclops to the right.

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,916
In case you
aren't in the know,

73
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,960
my new pal here has
a critical of four

74
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,253
and a double attack.

75
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,546
Aargh!

76
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,548
You lucky viewers
are about to witness

77
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,175
history in the making.

78
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,886
Gao Mikado's about to
lose his first match ever.

79
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,513
He's such a hater,
hey, A‐Dog?

80
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,514
Uh, A‐Dog?

81
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,558
Hey, where you at, yo?

82
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,517
Iron!

83
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,061
Argh!

84
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,772
Gotcha.

85
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,398
‐Uh.
‐You can do this.

86
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,066
Now you'll see
that I, Death Shido,

87
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,569
am the greatest
Buddyfighter in the world!

88
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,404
Cyclops, finish him!

89
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,281
Iron!

90
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,534
Hang tough, Gao,
I'm on my way.

91
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,120
I cast Blue
Dragon Shield!

92
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,626
Fine, I'll just finish
you on my next turn.

93
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,418
To finish his turn,

94
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,920
Death Shido
destroys Guns Knuckle

95
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,588
with Fate Skeleton.

96
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,798
Now Gao's up.

97
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,258
It's not looking
good for Mikado.

98
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,010
No, he's only got
two life points.

99
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,262
And Death Shido
has 12 left.

100
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,555
I've never seen
anyone come back

101
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,599
when the gap's
been this big.

102
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,019
Can you do this?

103
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,438
Somewhere, Tasuku
is watching us.

104
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,606
Huh?

105
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,983
So no matter
how tired I am,

106
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,611
I won't let him see me
give a lousy fight.

107
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,948
I got to dig deep
and deliver!

108
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,242
Draw!

109
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,368
Charge and draw!

110
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,663
You're up, pal.

111
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,289
I buddy call
Crimson Battler,

112
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,458
Drum Bunker Dragon
to the right!

113
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,294
Who needs food, I can
live on Buddyfight!

114
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,464
Hah, hah, arggh!

115
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,549
Arrgh!

116
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,133
Let's do this.

117
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,761
And now he's called up
Spin Nail Dragon.

118
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,721
You know what
that means, folks.

119
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,849
Time for the
Gao Formation!

120
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,683
Why'd you do that,

121
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,810
I mean, I still have
12 life points!

122
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,396
My fist will change
that, Doofus Shido.

123
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,355
Aah!

124
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,774
We're never going to win
with him as our fighter.

125
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,401
I couldn't agree more.

126
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,655
Master Ikazuchi,
what are you doing here?

127
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,323
Isn't it obvious?

128
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,700
I'm running
out of patience.

129
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,742
Grrr.

130
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,245
Death Shido's quickly
down to four life points.

131
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,663
You got to
hand it to Mikado,

132
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,540
he's now made
a game of it.

133
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,666
Heh, not for long.

134
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,043
Actually, my turn
isn't over yet.

135
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,836
What?

136
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,254
When he has a
fist item equipped,

137
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,006
his opponent has
four life or less,

138
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,133
and both players have
no monster in the center,

139
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,927
then the conditions
are perfect for...

140
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,054
Final Phase!

141
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,640
But I don't want
to get zapped again!

142
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,184
I cast...

143
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,185
And there it is!

144
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,771
The Impact card that
cost three gauge to use

145
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,649
and inflicts four damage
that can not be reduced.

146
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,905
♪

147
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,616
Impact!

148
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:52,495
Gigantic Crusher!

149
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,206
Why me?

150
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,500
(explosion)

151
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,045
♪

152
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,129
Game over.

153
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,089
Winner: Gao Mikado.

154
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,175
All right, now
we can get some...

155
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,217
You all right?

156
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,886
Do you need
some help?

157
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,429
Where's the
Hundred Demon card?

158
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,555
Up there.

159
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,307
‐Huh?
‐Uh?

160
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,226
‐Hah!
‐Hah!

161
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,395
Yet another
disappointment.

162
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,605
Grrr.

163
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,606
I know you.

164
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,233
My name is Ikazuchi.

165
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,693
Yeah, and?

166
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,862
I've come to
devour Tenbu!

167
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,405
Did someone
call my name?

168
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,200
This is the creep who
stole your memories, gramps.

169
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,368
Is that so?

170
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,079
Yes, but this time
I'll do more than that.

171
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,665
I'm gonna eat you down
to every last bone.

172
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,417
Or rather my
buddy Yamigedo will.

173
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,337
Yamigedo,
never heard of him.

174
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,798
Uh!

175
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,675
Not that horrible beast.

176
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,510
Don't tell me he's
recovered enough power

177
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,428
to fight again.

178
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,055
Count Dawn has
called two monsters,

179
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,058
setting himself up for
a triple attack formation!

180
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,601
And one of his
units, Cuelebre,

181
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,478
has the Penetrate ability.

182
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,439
But Lady Suzuha
has eight life left,

183
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,316
and she has

549
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,020
Well, where
are the others?

550
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,271
I don't know.

551
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,355
But if I had to guess,

552
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,815
I would say that
they are most likely

553
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,402
still on this planet
watching over the seal.

554
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,070
My Lady,
it may be best

555
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,989
if you returned
to your quarters.

556
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,616
Yes, you're right.

557
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,242
(crowd murmuring)

558
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,911
What is your
important announcement?

559
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,662
What was that monster
above the chateau?

560
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,373
Why was the Buddy Police
barrier activated?

561
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,043
Is it to do with
your big announcement?

562
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,004
Or is it all just
a publicity stunt?

563
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,298
I would never
do such a thing.

564
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,843
But if you must know,
I'll tell you.

565
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,929
It's about the danger
threatening our world.

566
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,096
(crowd gasping)

567
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,723
Now that I have
your attention,

568
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,600
it's about time you
knew that the Earth

569
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,061
is currently facing
an overwhelming threat.

570
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,854
A monster called Yamigedo,

571
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,940
who leads the
Hundred Demons army,

572
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,858
is trying to
destroy the planet.

573
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,568
And there's only
one way we'll be able

574
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,612
to avoid this fate.

575
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,489
Elicit the help
of the Omni Lords,

576
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,866
eight monsters
with immense power.

577
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,201
Omni Lords?

578
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,036
The Omni Lords are
believed to be living

579
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,788
right here on Earth.

580
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,206
It's possible
that some of them

581
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,376
have lost their memories
and don't know who they are.

582
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,460
They may be
living among us

583
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,796
and hiding the truth
about being Omni Lords.

584
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:22,258
Or even regular humans going
about their daily business

585
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,510
oblivious to
their past lives.

586
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,221
Whatever the case,
we must find them

587
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,180
or the Earth is doomed.

588
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,140
We must locate
them at any cost!

589
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,600
Omni Lords,
if you're out there,

590
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,726
our planet needs you now‐‐

591
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,144
It appears that
the whole world

592
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,480
knows about
the threat now.

593
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,815
Count Dawn!

594
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,150
What is going on?

595
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,527
It's just as you heard.

596
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,154
We need all hands
on deck right away.

597
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,031
All right,
we won't rest

598
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,366
until we find
all the Omni Lords

599
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,576
and the planet's safe.

600
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,081
Welcome to Tasuku's
Buddy Police 101.

601
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,249
Today I'm gonna
teach you all about

602
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,501
the cool new ability
card, Thunder Mine.

603
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,419
Awesome!

604
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,087
It's activated by the
size of monster called,

605
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,590
but it always causes
one damage point.

606
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,300
For Peluda,
it's a size one.

607
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,718
For Zazamera,
a size two.

608
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,136
And waive a size three.

609
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,846
When an opponent calls
one of this size,

610
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:09,763
the abilities trigger.

611
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,723
No way!

612
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,099
With each monster
that your opponent calls,

613
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,517
they lose a life
point right away.

614
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,145
It's a very useful
ability to have.

615
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,231
I'm gonna have Thunder Mine
nightmares for a week!

616

♪

617

That is if Yamigedo

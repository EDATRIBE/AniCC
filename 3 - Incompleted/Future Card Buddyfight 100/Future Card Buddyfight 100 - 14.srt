allowed for little else.

But if we
meet in person,

104
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,127
our Omni Lord emblems
will identify each other

105
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,629
and indicate so.

106
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,506
Omni Lord emblems?

Omni Lords possess.

legit by eyeballin' 'em,

Is there no other way?

112
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,144
Of course.

113
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,022
Omni Lords can be used in
card decks from any world.

114
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,818
And they have horns equal
to the number in their titles.

Omni Dragon Lord!

119
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,202
So that's
how it works.

How could you
not know that?

121
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,499
But Count, there aren't
any horns on your head.

122
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,167
But of
course there are.

123
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,878
See, look closely.

124
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,465

126
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,683
Identifying
the number of horns

127
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,603
with absolute certainty
will be difficult.

128
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,354
That leaves us with
only one option.

129
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,189
We're gonna have to meet
with all the suspects

130
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,859
face to face to see if
they fit the profile.

131
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,361
And we need to find them
before Ikazuchi does.

132
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,572
So, if he's hunting
down the Omni Lords,

133
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,532
who do you think will
be his first target?

134
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,617
If I had to guess,

135
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,243

it'll be me.

What's up
with that then?

140

Hundred Demons after you

141

been an epic fail.

142

your time has come.

146

Tenbu, then
that flower is...

If I return, I'd ask
for your hand in marriage.

Then the answer would
be absolutely no!

149

Gao hits Ikazuchi with

246

Not one

247
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,489
Ikazuchi's prepared

248
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,409
My minions, go

Ah!

00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,540
Once Vouivre
opened the center,

253
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,958
Gao is punished
with a series

254
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,793

Narukami's ability

With a timely block,

00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,060
Gao fends off
further damage.

264

of crystals, yo.

268
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,654
At this rate, he'll
eat the whole building.

Come on, we've
got to do something.

270

Aah!

272

Ikazuchi, control
your buddy down there.

273
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,709
We're in the middle of
a Buddyfight, you know.

274
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,669
Why would you
do such a thing?

275
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,339
How could you revive
a monster like this?

276
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,215
What's it to you?

Reinforce Formation of

281

Peluda has

00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,259
So what happened
to the people

365
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,718
that turned to stone?

366
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,805
I cast Hundred Demon
Sorcery, Yamitagae.

367
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,891
Who knows,
I can care less

368
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,809
what happened to them.

369
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,727
But they were your
family, weren't they?

370
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,104
Some family.

371
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,355
Uh, aargh.

372
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,065
Someone like you'd
never understand.

373
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,568
My so‐called family
was the enemy.

374
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,069
Don't you get it?

375
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,738
They manipulated me and
kept me down and oppressed.

376
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,782
I don't owe
them anything!

377
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,242
Uh.

378
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,451
Aaahhh!

379
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,162
Just because I was
born into my clan

380
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,707
I had to undergo brutal
training and hardships.

381
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,292
You couldn't cut it.

382
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,961
Growing up with everything
being handed to you.

383
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,629
I couldn't even
make simple choices

384
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,381
like what I
wanted to eat.

385
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,757
What right do
you think you have

386
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,800
to judge me?

387
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,469
When you put
it like that,

388
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,848
it is indeed a terrible
burden you have shouldered.

389
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,224
We couldn't
possibly imagine

390
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,934
what you went through.

391
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,104
And yet still, it
doesn't for one second

392
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,440
excuse the fact that you
released that monster

393
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,609
to wreak havoc
on this world.

394
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,110
But it's understandable.

395
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,613
No matter how much you
try to play the villain,

396
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,324
you're just
a foolish child.

397
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,784
Hang on a second
there, gramps.

398
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,245
You dare insult me!

399
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,790
Why, you, you're nothing
but a feeble old man.

400
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,002
I'll take down this chump
and devour you in one bite!

401
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,921
I call Rampage,
Chizomegumo

402
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,380
to the left position.

403
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,507
And use Hundred Demons'
Tome of Judgment,

404
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,426
which lets me
draw three cards.

405
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,638
And I call Demonic
Descend Ninja, Zeon

406
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,388
to the right.

407
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,766
Now I activate
Zeon's ability.

408
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,184
As you wish, master.

409
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,810
Demonic Descend
Ninja Arts,

410
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,438
return from
the underworld.

411
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,440
He revived him!

412
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,775
When Zeon's called,

413
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,818
he can revive a size
one or smaller monster

414
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,153
with the Thunder
Mine ability

415
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,572
from the drop zone.

416
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,991
It's incredible‐‐in a
dramatic change of events,

417
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,535
Ikazuchi's fielded a
full team of monsters,

418
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,871
after losing them
all just moments ago.

419
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,208
Ever danced
with a spider?

420
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,836
‐Raaaaa!
‐I cast Dragonic Formation!

421
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,088
Come on!

422
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,173
Tenbu moved from
the right to the center

423
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,217
to block
Peluda's attack.

424
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,511
You're nothing but
a walking corpse!

425
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,596
Haa!

426
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,264
Aw!

427
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,098
What a play!

428
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,475
Ikazuchi did a
link attack with Zeon.

429
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,184
Grandpa!

430
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,185
Oh, no!

431
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,105
My fate lies in
your hands now.

432
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,440
With the Reinforced
Formation of Hundred Demons,

433
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,819
Peluda has
revived once again!

434
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,321
That Ikazuchi never
runs out of monsters.

435
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,783
Well, old fool, have you
finally learned your lesson?

436
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,993
Your move.

437
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:57,785
Let's get him.

438
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,495
We owe it to gramps.

439
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,955
This guy's
ticking me off.

440
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,876
I call Burn Guts
striking to the left!

441
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,587
Gao's zapped with
another Thunder Mine,

442
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,547
this time from Peluda
in the center.

443
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,340
I need you, pal.

444
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,925

(shouts)

448
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,811
Okay, partner,
go and attack Peluda!

449
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,856
Consider this
payback for gramps!

450
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,775
I cast Hundred Demons
Sorcery, Yamitagae.

451
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,569
Aahh!

452
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,570
Sorry, kid.

Your turn,
Burn Guts,

open up that center!

455
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,699
Super Guts Combo Punch!

456
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,159

End of move.

460

Ikazuchi is down
to one life point

461
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,543
And Gao still
has five left.

462

without saying,

witness a miracle,

464
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,547
it's clear who
the winner will be.

465
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,591
Question is, does
Ikazuchi have it in him

466
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,842
to turn the tables?

467
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,094

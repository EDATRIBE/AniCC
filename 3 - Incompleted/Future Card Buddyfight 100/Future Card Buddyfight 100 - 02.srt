202
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,897
I always make it a habit
of keeping my deck with me

203
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,442

of the unlucky victims.

204

00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,329

to go do a thorough search

214

215
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,629
Meanwhile, I'll
check whether or not

216

at the junior high.

222

and he'd never miss
a Buddyfight lesson.

223
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,270
Maybe he went to report
his deck missing.

224
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,439
I guess that's possible.

225
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,566

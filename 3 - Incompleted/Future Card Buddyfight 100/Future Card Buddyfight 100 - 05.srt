00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,129
Buddyfight uses special
cards that act as portals

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,381
to bring monsters from
other worlds to Earth

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,175
to become buddies with humans.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,219
But now, a swarm
of evil monsters,

5
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,553
known as the Hundred Demons,

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,806
have come here illegally and
plan to destroy the planet.

7
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,975
It's time for an
Emergency Launch.

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,019
Buddy Skill on!

00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,395

10
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,399
Ah, it's not my
fault, I tell you!

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,319
Please, give me
another chance!

12
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,697
Maybe I should eat all
of you as well, huh?

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,159
No, please, I don't
think I taste very good!

14
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,994
(crying)

15
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,163
I'm so hungry,
I can't stand it.

16
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,207
‐Hungry!
‐Huh?

17
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,959
Looks like I'm not
the only one here

18
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,627
who's dying for a meal.

19
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,671
This guy is up next.

20
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,756
Awaken, power of darkness,

21
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,759
power of evil, power
of the Hundred Demons!

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,845
I'm Rage Thirst Emperor,
Grand Wilderness.

23
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,807
Feed me, I thirst for more.

24
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:57,849
Ah.

25
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,059
What do you want?

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,145
Well, you look
good enough to eat.

27
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,689
I'm not on the menu!

28
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,274
Master, do something!

29
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,650
Hungry.

30
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,693
Enough.

31

(crying)

32
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:13,615
Use this monster, and bring
me Tenbu for sure this time.

33
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,868
Either way, I'll be dining
on one of you tonight.

Am I like a ninja or what?

38
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,141
I'd say, "Or what."

39
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,186
You do realize you snuck
into the wrong class again.

40
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,729
Did not, I looked.

41
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,147
Gao's not in this class.

42
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,900
Commander I called him away
right after homeroom.

43
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,611
He's off chasing
illegal monsters again.

44
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,696
Huh?

45
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,407
Hm?

Oh, yeah.

the Hundred Demons.

‐No, wait.

unique timing during a game

I made this for you.

‐Hm, made what?

What else would I
be talking about?

220
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,833
And everything's
missing from my fridge!

221
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,377
It doesn't take a major
braniac to figure out

222
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,880
that either you or
Sofia must have taken it!

I would never
do such a thing.

‐Hm?
‐This is who ate your lunch.

233
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,776
Eat more.

234
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,902
So hungry.

the new Hundred Demons card

237
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,575
Master Ikazuchi gave me.

238
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,579
More, I need more!

239
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,289
I guess he was so s‐starving

240
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,917
that he came out of
the card on his own.

241
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,085
(grunts)

242
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,254
He could ruin everything.

243
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,673
We must find him right away!

244
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,508
Strange reports of
food disappearing

from local restaurants
and convenience stores

246
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,512
are sweeping across the city.

247
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,472
With me now is the
manager of Munchy Time,

248
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,266
recent victim of
this bizarre trend.

249
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,977
Grand Wilderness has to
be behind all of this.

250
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,563
He must still be
somewhere nearby.

251
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,356
Maybe this will draw him out.

252
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,316
Huh, where did you get that?

253
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,444
It's my secret stash
of canned sushi.

254
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,446
Oh, I missed breakfast.

255
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,740

an illegal monster

all the food.

263
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,800

lifted the wicked spread

Yes, you must
capture it right away.

If he's not contained soon,

270

food in Cho‐Tokyo.

00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,202
No, he can't,
it's too dangerous.

365
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,454
We don't have
any other choice.

Tetsuya destroys

So hungry!

404
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,041
I wonder what the 4‐1‐1 is

405
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,293
on Death Shido's
buddy monster today.

406
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:45,379
Let's check it out
with my handy Takoscope.

407
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,799
Locking onto Rage Thirst
Emperor, Grand Wilderness.

408
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,385
Dragon Lord
attribute, size two.

409
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,720
Power is 5,000.

410
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,139
Defense, also 5,000.

411
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,515
A critical of two.

412
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,061
He has one ability,
but no Lifelink.

413
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,188
I thirst for more.

414
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,148
Give me something to eat!

415
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,441
Ah!

416
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,818
Oh, watch out,
I have quite a kick!

417
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,154
When Grand Wilderness
destroys an opponent's monster,

418
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,530
the player regains two life.

419
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,076
So the more monsters he eats,
the more life I get back.

420
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,911
A penetrating charge!

421
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,454
Sorciere gains Double Attack

422
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,706
when destroying an
opponent's monster.

423
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,084
You'll never guess.

424
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,961
Paruko's doing
another live broadcast.

425
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,755
No way, Tetsuya's
fighting instead of Gao?

426
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,007
Little Land deals
a powerful blow.

427
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,885
And here comes
Sorciere's second attack.

428
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,886
End of move.

429
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,888
Agree to hand over Tenbu now,

430
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,849
and I'd be willing to
let you out of this place.

431
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,768
Tetsuya,
or whatever your name is,

432
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,521
you must make the
exchange and hand me over.

433
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,774
There's no shame in
surrendering, Tets.

434
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,193
He's only interested
in Tenbu, after all.

435
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,861
You just need
to hand him over,

436
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,697
and we can all
get out of here.

437
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,740
(groaning)

438
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,867
Well, what do
you think, Tets?

439
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:01,038
Well, if I give up Tenbu,
Gao will be super sad, yo.

440
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,749
Bumming out a friend's
something I could never do.

441
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,252
Besides, we're just
getting started.

442
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,211
Come on!

443
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,756
It's time to serve this
demon the main course.

444
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,259
I was hoping
you'd say that.

445
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,136
First, I'm gonna
cast Nice One.

446
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,346
He's increased the
cards in his hand.

447
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,890
Then set the spell
Solomon's Great Barrier,

448
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,685
and call Fallen Angel of
Rage, Beleth to the center.

449
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,478
Now I get to hit someone.

450
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,231
Next, I call Sky Poet,
Amon to the right.

451
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,983
To fight or not to fight.

452
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,944
The Great Barrier makes size
two monsters into size one,

453
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,488
enabling an all‐out
attack formation.

454
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,449
(laughing)

455
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,742
Hey there, Sorciere.

456
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,619
Do you need a
ride to the fair?

457
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,370
I'm gonna hit you hard!

458
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,914
I cast the Dragon
Prudent spell!

459
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,292
But I wanted to hit him.

460
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,336
Forgive me, but
I must attack.

461
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,339
(grunting)

462
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,381
End of move.

463
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,259
Amon ends the attack by
causing three damage!

464
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,470
Let's see how Death
Shido will respond.

465
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,099
Ah, well, even a broken
claw can break twice a day.

466
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,144
Once again I call Demon
Fairy Dragon, Sorciere

467
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,103
to the center!

468
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,606
No matter how many life
points you take from me,

469
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,149
I'll keep getting them back.

470
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,110
Grand Wilderness,
go and attack Amon!

471
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,279
I've never been so underfed.

472
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,031
I'll eat everything I see.

473
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,408
I knew you were
gonna do that, yo.

474
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,369
I cast Magical Goodbye.

475
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,705
Not before the appetizer!

476
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,958
Back to the
cards in his hand.

477
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,251
That's so not fair!

478
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,087
But Death Shido's
remaining monsters

479
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,381
attack Tetsuya in
rapid succession,

480
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,299
leaving him with
just one life point.

481
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,468
It doesn't look good
for the young fighter.

482
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,679
Could this be the
end of the line?

483
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,805
Uh.

484
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,807
So, what do you think
we should do now,

485
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,558
oh, future king?

486
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,977
When I'm king, I'll
build a new country,

487
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,646
one that's got
music and dancing

488
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,564
coming out of its ears, yo.

489
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,400
But just song
and dance alone

490
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,318
can't fill an
empty stomach, Tets.

491
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,320
I know, but nothing
energizes you

492
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,239
like the hippest,
hoppenest beats.

493
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,325
Do I sense some
freestyling coming on?

494
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,953
How about groovin' on
some backup, A‐Dog?

495
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,705
I'm down with that.

496
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:10,583
Back by popular demand,

497
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,586
I buddy call Demon Lord,
Asmodai to the center.

498
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:15,296
Let's bust some moves.

499
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:20,885
It's showtime!

500
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,680
Dangerous backdrop!

501
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,473
Thanks for clearing
out the center.

502
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:27,809
Now I'll send in Amon
to attack the fighter.

503
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,811
Yo, yo, yo!

504
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,272
I cast Dragon Prudent spell!

505
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,231
Uh‐oh.

506
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,817
He blocked the attack
with a counter spell.

507
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,570
(laughing)

508
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,822
Oh!

509
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,658
Demon drop kick!

510
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:46,369
I've got you exactly
where I want you.

511
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:47,620
In your dreams.

512
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,706
My turn isn't over yet.

513
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,416
Final phase!

514
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,751
Hey, Gao!

515
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,879
Is that Tetsuya?

516
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,338
Welcome back to the party.

517
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:59,382
Now you can check
out my impact.

518
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:02,552
No, don't tell me this
is happening again!

519
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,429
I cast...

520
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,140
(grunting)

521
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,057
Huh?

522
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:10,810
...Diabolical Hardcore!

523
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,105
No, why me?

524
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:16,649
Game over.

525
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,985
Winner, Tetsuya Kurodake.

526
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:20,528
Huh?

527
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:22,780
He was one of the
Hundred Demons.

528
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,240
Thanks a lot, Tetsuya.

529
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,117
‐You saved us.
‐Oh, I just did

530
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:27,911
what any good
friend would do, yo.

531
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,746
(cell phone ringing)

532
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,081
Hi, Gao, come to
HQ right away,

533
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:33,583
and bring Tetsuya with you.

534
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,542
Uh...

535
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:37,378
With the recent increase

536
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:39,297
in illegal monster
activity on Earth,

537
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:42,216
the Buddy Police doesn't have
enough officers to keep up,

538
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:44,344
so I have a favor
to ask of you.

539
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,970
In light of your
recent victory,

540
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,056
would you be interested
in coming to work for us

541
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,475
as a Buddy Police
trainee just like Gao?

542
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,685
For real, yo?

543
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:53,686
Yes, for real.

544
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:56,230
Your fight today was
absolutely brilliant.

545
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,942
I believe you're more
than qualified to join us.

546
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,234
Congrats, man!

547
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:02,320
Actually, I've been
trying to find a way

548
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,113
to ease the pain on Gao here,

549
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:07,033
so this is totally off
the hook, Commander I.

550
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,494
I'd be stoked to
become a trainee, yo.

551
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,787
Excellent.

552
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,746
You start right away.

553
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,959
(laughing)

554
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,712
Hm, well, I guess
it can't be helped.

555
00:22:19,712 --> 00:22:21,881
‐Excuse me?
‐Hm?

556
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:24,968
I could swear that we've
met somewhere before.

557
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,970
Yeah, yeah, your memory.

558
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,305
You said the same
thing to Count Dawn.

559
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:31,933
I bet you've probably
seen me on TV.

560
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,228
I'm a big celebrity with the
number one hip‐hop dance show.

561
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,606
Mm, yes, maybe that was it.

562
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:40,733
Mm.

563
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,527
Ahh!

564
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,571
Sorry, Master!

565
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:47,699
You're a bunch
of useless fools!

566
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:52,996
Welcome to Tasuku's
Buddy Police 101.

567
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,163
Today I'll teach you about

568
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:56,666
Rage Thirst Emperor,
Grand Wilderness.

569
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,584
‐Cool!
‐This Hundred Demon

570
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,502
eats other monsters

571
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:01,504
and converts them
into life points.

572
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:03,256
When he destroys
an enemy monster,

573
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,967
the player using the
card regains two life.

574
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,053
So the more he destroys,
the more your points increase.

575
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:10,179
That's amazing!

576
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:13,349
Using Grand Wilderness to attack
just proves what they say,

577
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,101
"The best defense
is a good offense."

578
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:16,310
They also say to let us

579
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,854
out of class early
to go practice.

580
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,563
(laughs)

581
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:51,072
Next time, Akatsuki
thinks Zanya would make

582
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,573
a great Buddy Police trainee.

583
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:54,742
When an escaped criminal
Buddyfighter shows up

584
00:24:54,742 --> 00:24:56,410
with a Hundred
Demon as a buddy,

585
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,412
the brothers are
forced into action.

586
00:24:58,412 --> 00:25:00,248
Next episode,
"Brothers in Arms!

587
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,166
The Battle of
Dragon Brainbaltes!"

588
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,668
Join us for a Buddyfight!

While here in the Skull Pit,

363
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,911
we're able to talk to
the fighters if we want.

364
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,247
And how would you
know that, bro?

365
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,207
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

366
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,292
With his first attack,

367
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,502
Death Shido uses
King of Forest, Zlatorog

368
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,839
to increase his gauge and
cause two damage points to Gao.

369
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,757
Now it's Gao's turn.

370
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,801
Draw.

371
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,594
Charge and draw.

372
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,056
Let's see how he handles this.

373
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,683
Ready or not.

374
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,979
Behold, super burning speed
to round up all criminals!

375
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,355
Transform!

376
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,235
Explosive Takedown,
Rampage Sonic.

377
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,946
Amazingly, Gao has
transformed himself!

378
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,991
Transform is an ability
that's unique to Hero World.

379
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,452
You can actually equip
a monster like an item

380
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,163
and go into battle yourself.

381
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,456
This is awkward.

382
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,166
I can't move in this.

383

384
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,253
That's better, this'll
be more than enough.

385
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,964
I call Cyber Police,
Assault Leader to the left,

386
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,133
and now I Buddy Call
to the right

387
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,135
Buddy Police, Decker Drum.

388
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,386

391
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,602

393
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,482
I'm not sure, but I think
that's the Gao formation.

394
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,567
If it ain't broke,
don't fix it,

395

we're fighting for.

396
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,490

397
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,658
Off the chain.

398
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,826
His gauge just
increased by four.

399
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,537

Drum's ability.

402

Whenever the kid
here pays two gauge,

403
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,671
I can destroy one of
our opponent's monsters.

404

Twin‐Headed Hellhound,
Orthrus is a Size 2 monster.

434
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,403
Attributes are
Wydar Sarkal and Olympus,

with a power of 5,000,
defense of 3,000,

The link attack gives
Death Shido 8,000 power.

00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,116
I wonder if sunscreen
would help him.

546
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,450
We should ask.

547
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,247
Welcome to Tasuku's
Buddy Police 101.

548
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,457
Today I'm gonna tell
you all about the card

549
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,667
Buddy Police, Decker Drum.

550
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,668
All right.

551
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,670
It's the Hero World
version of Drum's card,

552
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,089
and it always gets the
monster he's fighting.

553
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,300
He has an ability that
destroys any monster

554
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,719
if you pay two gauge,
and as long as you have enough,

555
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,430
you can use this cool
ability every turn.

556
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,598
That's awesome.

557
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,391
Even when facing
a powerful monster,

558
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,852
you've nothing to fear with
Buddy Police, Decker Drum

559
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:15,853
on your side.

560
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,147
Decker Nose is detecting
some chocolate pudding.

561
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,523
My favorite.

563
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,116
Next time, Gao's sent
to a Buddyfight event

564
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:55,202
to do some teaching,
and Death Shido tracks him down.

565
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,079
Meanwhile, Paruko steals Tenbu

566
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,374

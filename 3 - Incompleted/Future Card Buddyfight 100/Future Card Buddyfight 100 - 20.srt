00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,281
You're the best Buddy
a stubborn guy like me

182
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,075
could ever ask for.

183
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,659
Daichi, be strong.

184
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,411
Don't talk like that!

185
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,955
Tell my wife I love her

186
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,751
and that she made me the
happiest man in the world.

187
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,671
And tell Kazane that...

188
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,424
(screaming)

189
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,971
Officer Fujimiya was lost
while performing his duties,

190
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,767
and after that day, Count
Dawn left active service.

191
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,519
And, as you observed earlier,

192
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,770
Count Dawn has secretly

193
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,190
watched over the
Fujimiya family ever since.

194
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,901
For some reason, he doesn't
wish to meet young Kazane

195
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,070
or let her know he exists.

196
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,364
What a guy‐‐telling
us to get over Tenbu

197
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,741
when he hasn't even
dealt with this?

198
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,576
And if he wants
to protect Kazane,

199
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,870
why doesn't he just
meet her in person?

200
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,997
♪

201
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,166
Count, I have a
favor to ask you.

202
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,794
Just this once, I was wondering

203
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,587
if you would be part of my deck.

204
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,340
I need your help in my
Buddyfight with Kazane.

205
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,926
So you know.

206
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,469
I see what you're doing.

207
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,682
I wasn't born
yesterday, Mr. Mikado.

208
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,225
You're just like the rest.

209
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:47,230
Why is everyone so determined
to have me meet with Kazane?

210
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,024
I can only tell you
why I think you should.

211
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:55,155
Until we accept our past, we
can never move on, never heal.

212
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,407
I'm sure you're just
dying to meet her.

213
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,783
You owe it to your Buddy!

214
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,036
And if you join Gao's deck, you
can see her during the fight!

215
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,414
What you tell her is up to you!

216
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,128
I'm going to surprise Kazane

217
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,672
with her favorite
Cobb salad for dinner.

218
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,634
Huh?

219
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,182
Dawny?

220
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,691
In just a few short minutes,
Gao Mikado and Kazane Fujimiya

221
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,318
will be squaring
off in a Buddyfight

222
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,571
at our very own Aibo
Academy Fighting Stage!

223
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,865
‐Here it is, bro.
‐Thanks, man.

224
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,075
Sorry to ask for
such a big favor.

225
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,453
Don't sweat it‐‐I'm
getting used to you

226
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,121
asking for the impossible.

227
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,041
Come on, you know it's
the deck builder's job

228
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,584
to support the fighter.

229
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,044
Yeah, I guess.

230
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,214
‐Let's do this.
‐Oh, yeah.

231
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,966
Have fun, you two,
and best of luck!

232
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,344
We'd better head
to the Buddy pit.

233
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,014
‐Hey, look.
‐Look at what?

234
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:07,060
That lady over there,
she looks exactly like Kazane!

235
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,688
Hi, how are you?

236
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,400
Will the fighters
please Luminize?

237
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,654
Emergency Launch, from
the eye of the storm!

238
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,197
Luminize!

239
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,532
Beaming Sunshine Guardians!

240
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,911
A kaleidoscope of
excitement and adventure!

241
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,872
Luminize, Kaleido Labyrinth!

242
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,082
You know what to do!

243
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,500
Say it with me now!

244
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,543
Buddy...

245
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,212
‐Fight!
‐Fight!

246
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,256
‐Time to raise the flag!
‐Time to raise the flag!

247
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,549
I fight for Hero World!

248
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,885
And I'm with Dungeon World.

249
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:45,223
Hey, Kazane is always
raving about the Buddy pit.

250
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,975
It is really neat!

251
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,268
Yeah, bro.

252
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,936
You'll have a bird's
eye view of her match

253
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,980
from inside this choice perch.

254
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,399
I've never seen you at
one of her fights before.

255
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,444
No, normally I don't
come, but this time Dawny‐‐

256
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,863
I just felt it
was time, you know.

257
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,365
That's it, Gummy Slime!

258
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,158
Attack the fighter!

259
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,660
(squeaking)

260
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,704
End of move.

261
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,205
That's the way!

262
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,124
How unseemly!

263
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,419
Look how happy she is up there!

264
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,962
It warms my heart.

265
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,631
Only Buddyfighting
makes her smile like that.

266
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,675
When I think of
how she used to be,

267
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,802
it's like a dream come true.

268
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,721
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

269
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,015
Gao's called out
the Cyber Police Army

270
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,809
with an intimidating
Triple Formation!

271
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,312
Permission to use force, Chief.

272
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,271
You bet!

273
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,815
Attack that Gummy
Slime in the center!

274
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,608
‐10‐4.
‐I cast!

275
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,277
Huh?

276
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,945
Hidden Crossbow!

277
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,365
♪

278
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,325
That spell can
destroy any monster

279
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,828
with 3,000 defense or less!

280
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,621
I've gotta hand
it to you, Kazane,

281
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,914
you are strong!

282
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,041
After her father passed,

283
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,168
it was pretty tough
going for a while.

284
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,046
She wouldn't eat and barely
cracked a smile at anything.

285
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,505
There were days
when she wouldn't even

286
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,299
come out of her room.

287
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,802
Listen to me going on‐‐you kids
don't wanna hear me rambling

288
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,846
all about my crazy problems!

289
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,139
(laughing)

290
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,432
Why is she laughing, bro?

291
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,225
I don't think it's very funny.

292
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,644
Yeah, it's hard to
know how to react.

293
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,647
Dungeons are swarming
with dangerous traps.

294
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,734
Draw‐‐charge and draw!

295
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:23,821
I pay two gauge and call a size
three monster to the center.

296
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,823
Ready or not!

297
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,452
Here comes Guardian Dragon
of the Shrine, Lumiere!

298
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,663
Most don't last
long in my company!

299
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,998
Check his ability!

300
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,834
Activate Holy Blast!

301
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,878
Lumiere can take out
one of his opponent's

302
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,506
size one or lesser monsters
both when he appears

303
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,674
and also when he's destroyed!

304
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,844
Perfect, now keep going
and attack the fighter!

305
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,889
Fear my holy claw!

306
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,849
And his Double Attack!

307
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,477
End of move.

308
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:58,022
Lumiere's Double Attack
comes as a shocking surprise!

309
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,315
Down to just four life points,

310
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,692
Gao quickly finds
himself on the ropes.

311
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,028
Whenever you're in trouble
is when a hero arrives

312
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,780
to save the day.

313
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,907
Let's take things up a notch.

314
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,325
Draw!

315
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,577
(yelling)

316
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,832
Charge and draw!

317
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:20,461
I call Heroic Blader to
the right and left areas!

318
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,089
Blade of Justice, Heroic Blader!

319
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,759
The Judge and Jury,
Heroic Blader!

320
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,177
Here I go.

321
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,472
Time to turn up the heat.

322
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,934
I pay one gauge and transform!

323
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,980
Fiery Inspector,
Prominence Burst!

324
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,566
Look at that‐‐how cool is he?

325
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,112
Then one day, everything
just suddenly changed.

326
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,114
I'd never seen anything like it.

327
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,033
She received a letter
from a certain someone.

328
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,329
Whatever was in it
really hit home with her.

329
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,831
When she finished reading it,

330
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,251
she said the most
surprising thing.

331
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,670
Mom, I know what to do now.

332
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,133
I want to try and
make 100 friends!

333
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,385
Prominence Buster Knuckle!

334
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,803
(yelling)

335
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,431
I'm curious‐‐what exactly
did the letter say?

336
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,267
I don't know‐‐it was a
letter addressed to Kazane

337
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,894
from her father.

338
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,438
Double Attack on the fighter!

339
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,690
Raptor Blade!

340
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,776
(groaning)

341
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,946
But how can that be‐‐
who wrote the letter?

342
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,364
That's just the thing,

343
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,075
it was sent by her
father's Buddy monster.

344
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,827
And now I hear
he's an instructor

345
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,747
‐with the Buddy Police.
‐Your move.

346
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,250
I activate Seventh Omni Earth
Lord, Count Dawn's ability!

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,254
I pay one life, and revive him
from the Drop Zone to the left!

348
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,632
The Twilight Returner.

349
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,342
This is an unexpected surprise!

350
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,136
Gao's Buddy Police boss,
the distinguished Count Dawn,

351
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,554
has now joined the fight!

352

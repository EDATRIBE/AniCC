Now that the devastating
monster, Yamigedo,

has been revived, the only way
to seal him away again is with

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,846
the power of
the eight Omni Lords.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,767
It's up to us to find them,
and there's only one way we can!

7

We gotta Buddyfight!

8
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,564
Okay, let's try another one.

If you're on a bus
that's traveling

10
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,777
55 kilometers an hour,
and the Buddyfight stage

11
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,862
is 75 kilometers
from the school,

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,490

take to get there?

180
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,815
Well, whatever
you think you are,

181
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,484
I'm gonna take you down
with my Hero deck.

182
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,946
Hold the phone,
what's with that deck, pal?

183
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,782
I said I wanted to have
a dragon battle with you.

184
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,493
I'm a little confused;
aren't you a tiger?

185
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,953
Now you're a dragon?

186
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,747
No, I fight for Dragon World!

187
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:02,500
So, then what's
with the tiger getup?

188
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,336
I wear it 'cause my
last name means "tiger."

189
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,172
Look at that,
the mysterious fighter

190
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,799
is none other than Noboru Kodo!

191
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,342
(whoosh)

192
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,386
Don't forget about me!

193
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,637
I don't believe it!

194
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,514
I haven't seen you
in, like, forever!

195
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,391
How have you been,
and why on earth

196
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,851
did you come back home?

197
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,312
To knock some sense
into you, obviously.

198
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,023
Huh?

199
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,191
Here, catch!

200
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,859
Leave the rest to me!

201
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,652
So, what'd you go
and do that for?

202
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,322
If you beat me,
I'll give you your deck back,

203
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,158
but now use
your dragon deck.

204
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,076
Uh‐oh.

205
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,371
Yeah, sure, I understand.

206
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,123
Hmm.

207
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,584
(gears whirring)

208
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,595
Hurry up and luminize so I
can prove I'm better than you.

209
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,974
It's you!

210
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,060
It's Sofia Sakharov!

211
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,729
Wait, are they
going after Gao?

212
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,316
Gao Mikado, Master
Ikazuchi challenges you.

213
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,276
Accept or suffer
the same fate as

214
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,070
your dear friend, Tenbu.

215
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,489
That's the guy who beat Gao?

216
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,283
Darkness Barrier, activate!

217
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,701
(rumbling)

218
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,744
(grunting)

219
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,787
Not this again!

220
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,831
What's happening?

221
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:36,094
♪

222
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,305
Just when you think you're out,
they pull you back in.

223
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,891
‐Where are we?
‐In a Darkness Barrier.

224
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,519
And we're stuck in here
until we manage to defeat

225
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,105
that Ikazuchi fellow.

226
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,398
Warp successful!

227

Wherever there are Buddyfights,
Paruko Nanana will be there!

228
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,155
We have another live broadcast
from the Darkness Barrier!

229
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,531
Hurry up already!

230
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,201
Gao, will you
be able to do this?

00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,162
(grunts)

232
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,373
Game over.

233
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,750
Winner: Ikazuchi.

234
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,127
(roars)

235
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,673
Grandpa.

237
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,012
You okay?

238
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,096
We can't do this.

239
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,599
Giving up without a fight?

240
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,143
I didn't take you for
a spineless loser!

241
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,520
Oh, well, it's dinner time!

242
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,147
‐Not so fast.
‐Huh?

243
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,608
What kind of player brags
about defeating someone

244
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,193
who can't fight back?

245
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,236
Let me, the great Noboru Kodo,

246
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,821
be your opponent.

247
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,823
When I'm done with you,
you won't be able

248
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,491
to devour an ant.

249
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,659
Did you hear that?

250
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,912
Noboru's just challenged
Ikazuchi to fight him

251
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,371
instead of Gao!

252
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,166
And then the plot thickens.

253
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,334
Show yourself.

254
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,003
All in good time,
I apologize for being

255
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,340
a tad late to the party.

256
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,549
Who are you?

257
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,052
I am one of the Hundred Demons,

258
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,179
First Knight of
the Apocalypse Gratos,

259
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,764
to be exact.

260
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,603
The fight is about to begin!

261
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,272
Come on, hurry,
I don't wanna miss anything.

262
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,942
Let's kick it into top gear!

263
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,568
I'm glad I had that nap.

264
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,028
Yeah, you're fully charged

265
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,363
to help Gao, yo!

266
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,240
(motor puttering)

267
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,741
How can you help, Tasuku?

268
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,577
You don't have a buddy
or even a core gadget.

269
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,705
Even so, I have no choice.

270
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,375
Hundred Demons
lurking in the darkness,

271
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,253
destroy and rampage,
devour the world!

272
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,589
Dark Luminize
Hundred Thunder Demons!

273
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,551
With golden wings at my back,
I soar through the sky!

274
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,554
Luminize Noble Wing Knights!

275
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,598
Buddyfight!

276
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,392
Time to raise the flag!

277
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,310
Parade of Hundred Demons!

278
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,271
I'm with Dragon World.

279
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,398
Ikazuchi has the first move.

280
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,567
First, he calls Rampage
Chizomegumo to the center,

281
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,112
then Stranger Dilemma
to the left, and he sets

282
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,155
the spell star, Yamigedo.

283
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,699
No, Noboru, stop!

284
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,742
He's just too dangerous!

285
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,077
It's too late.

286
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,288
Chizomegumo,
devour the fighter!

287
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:13,334
In your dreams,
I cast Dragonic Thunder!

288
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,752
(screams)

289
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,171
Hope you can do better
than that, tough guy.

290
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,550
I can, Stranger Dilemma's
Thunder Mine activates!

291
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,634
Say what?

292
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,429
I despise cocky smart alecks.

293
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,390
Behold, my Thunder Mine!

294
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,017
End of move.

295
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,519
Yowza, what a terrifying move!

296
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,063
That was Stranger Dilemma's
ability, was it not?

297
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,484
Yes, a Thunder Mine activates
when an opponent uses a spell.

298
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,611
How are you holding up, my boy.

299
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,114
Eh, I've had a lot worse.

300
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,991
Step aside and let me fight!

301
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,784
I couldn't forgive
myself if you ended up

302
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,995
like gramps Tenbu.

303
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,456
Why do you never give me
enough credit, Gao?

304
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,373
What do you mean?

305
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,459
This guy beat you,
so if I defeat him,

306
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,794
it means I'm stronger
than you, right?

307
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,338
I'll win and prove to you
once and for all that I'm

308
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,007
the better Buddyfighter.

309
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,468
I draw, charge and draw!

310
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:07,096
Buddy Call to the right,
Dragon Knight, El Quixote!

311
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,515
I'll charge to
the ends of the Earth!

312
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,185
I call Dragon Knight,
Red Baron to the left!

313
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,311
(shouts)

314
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:17,315
I equip Soar Now,
Calvary Dragon, Hyperion!

315
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,234
There it is; Noboru's
become one with his monster

316
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,862
and set up a three
in a row formation!

317
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,407
Red Baron, go attack Dilemma.

318
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,784
No, wait!

319
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,327
I'll show them what I can do.

320
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,829
Helping Gao is just a bonus.

321
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,873
Another clipped wing
for my Red Baron.

322
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,792
An Assault of Glory!

323
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,544
(zapping)

324
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,838
I'm tired of him
doubting my abilities

325
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,674
and treating Gao like
he's some kind of hero!

326
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,843
(zapping)

327
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,513
End of move.

328
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,390
That boy has something special.

329
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,352
He could prove useful
as a sacrificial pawn

330
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,270
for the great Yamigedo.

331
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,565
I cast Hundred Demon
Sorcery, Akishoki!

332
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,193
With six life,
I can draw two cards.

333
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,277
Yeah!

334
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,946
He deliberately
allowed the attack

335
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,739
so he could cast that spell.

336
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:11,035
Increasing the cards in his hand
does not bode well for Noboru.

337
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,830
But he can't use it without
a Hundred Demons card

338
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,123
in the field.

339
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,374
Huh?

340
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,794
His set spell must have
a Hundred Demons attribute.

341
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,797
He's calling one Hundred Demons
monster after the other!

342
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,716
(zapping)

343
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,510
♪

344
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,012
Thanks to Zion's ability,
Dilemma is revived in

345
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,389
the center position.

346
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,932
I equip.

347
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,725
Veiled in the
darkness of terror,

348
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,727
awake the mighty jaws
of the wicked beast

349
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,604
that hungers for misery,

350
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,398
Thunder Claw, Narukami!

351
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,902
Devour him completely,
my Hundred Demons!

352
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,072
I move Red Baron to the center!

353

Ugh, I'm hit!

Demonic Descend, Slash!

Eraser Blade!

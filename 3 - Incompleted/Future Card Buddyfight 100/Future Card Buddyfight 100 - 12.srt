Buddyfight uses special
cards that act as portals

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,797
to bring monsters from
other worlds to Earth,

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,925
to become Buddies with humans.

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,593
But now, a swarm
of evil monsters

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,221
known as The Hundred Demons
have come here illegally

6
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,473
and plan to destroy the planet.

7
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,517
It's time for an
emergency launch.

8
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,227
Buddy Skill, on!

9
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,732
Thanks for meeting me
away from the others.

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,113
Don't you think it's
about time you told me?

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,907
We are on the same side.

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,747
Tell you what, exactly?

13
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,959
Enough games; we've
known each other too long.

14
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,211
I know you have intel about
the overwhelming threat

15
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,089
Tenbu spoke of before
he lost his memory.

16
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,593
You have no need to worry.

17
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,011
You sure about that?

18
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,846
If this terrible threat appears,

19
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,807
I promise to tell
you everything.

20
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,810
Above all else,
I am true to my word.

21
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,688
Well, let's just hope
that day never comes, huh?

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,704
I take it that until
the girl is old enough,

23
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,582
you'd like things to just
continue as they are?

24
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,167
Even if he did fully
awaken in the near future,

25
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,546
it would still leave ample
time for her to grow up.

26
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,257
And while we're pointing
fingers, Asmodai,

27
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,051
why are you carrying on
as if you know nothing?

28
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,971
I guess I'd like to keep
playing with Tetsuya.

29
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,557

kind of grown on me.

to Suzuha's party this weekend?

33

Sure did, bro, at her
family's country estate.

34
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,996
It's gonna be totally choice.

35
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,541
But she's keeping secret
what she's celebrating

36
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,167
until the day of the party.

37
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,547
Rumor has it that she's
going to be officially named

38
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,966
the Head of the Amanosuzu Group.

39
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,303
Good for her,
that sounds amazing.

40

Yeah, well, who cares,
I'm just gonna fill my belly

It looks like all the students
of Aibo Academy will be invited.

43

You should come with us, Gao.

44

I can't; this Sunday I'm
scheduled for a double shift,

Kuguru's right, kid, this
Buddy Police gig is grueling.

49
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,665
Every day, we gotta work
late responding to calls.

50
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,710

Suzuha, is that you?

00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,511
I think my blood sugar's low.

54
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,555
It looks just like Suzuha.

55
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,848
But it's a robot.

56
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,683
Here's an invitation.

57
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,895
Party at Country House, don't
miss good times and good food.

These rich folks are weird.

59

Well, I guess it saves her
from having to do it herself.

Sorry, but, I won't
be able to make it.

Taste what you'll be missing.

62
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,156
That'll sure hit the spot.

63
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,407
Yeah, it will!

64
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,576
You two are going to party.

66
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,592
Ha ha ha ha.

67
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,636
Wait, where's the food?

68
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,723
Oh, good, you're
finally here, bia.

69
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,558
Why'd you bring us here?

70
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,853
That's easy, to make sure
you'll be attending my party,

71
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,396
of course, bia.

72
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:17,150
Because, I can't very well
announce our wedding engagement

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,611
without the groom
present, can I?

74
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,488
What?

75
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,824
Congratulations, Lady Suzuha.

76
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,701
Why choose Gao as
your future husband?

77
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,871
Is it because of his
skills as a Buddyfighter?

78
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,207
No, it's because of love, bia.

79
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,168
What gives? I'm your best
friend, why didn't you tell me?

80
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,837
Because it's not true!

81
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,381
You're scheduled to promise
to marry tomorrow, bia.

82
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,799
Tomorrow?

83
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,844
Something's off, is that
really Suzuha up there?

84
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,804
And so you don't try to
leave before the party,

85
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,849
I've set up some special
bridegroom training for you.

86
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,770
After all, happy
wife, happy life.

87
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,282
Where are we?

88
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:09,077
I don't know, but
it looks familiar.

89
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,080
It's Principal
Ikarino's dungeon stage!

90
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,541
Not exactly, Mr. Mikado.

91
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,376
Although similar
to the one belonging

92
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,963
to Aibo Academy Elementary
School's Principal Ikarino,

93
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,047

94
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,217
but rather, an exact replica.

95
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,345
It's all part of Lady Suzuha's
Buddyfight training.

96
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,180
To practice in real
world surroundings,

97
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,392
she had various fighting
stages built within the chateau.

98
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,019
Would somebody tell
me what's going on?

99
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,854
We're dragged here
against our will,

100
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,481
and now she says we're engaged
and I'm in bridegroom training!

101
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,317
Is this some kind of joke?

102

Yeah, let us out of here!

103
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,737
And give us some
food for the road.

I wish we could, but it's
totally out of our hands.

We've fallen out
of favor with her.

My lady sent us
down here as well.

important announcement tonight.

186

world‐renowned equipment
manufacturing enterprise,

187

tired right now.

He must be totally
exhausted by now, meaning

192
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,551
Mysterious Dekarabia should
be able to defeat him easily.

193

Don't you want to defeat Gao,
and take Tenbu away from him

Why aren't you all dressed up?

198
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:51,276
The invitation was very clear in
asking us to wear formal attire.

199

‐These are my formal clothes.
‐Yeah, right.

200
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,282
You're lucky, Zanya,
you dress formally every day.

201
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,534
Father says,
"Clothes make the man."

00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,537
No, Gao's gone missing.

204

We haven't been able to
contact him for three days.

205
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,127
It's not like him; He's
vanished without a trace.

I had no idea, bro.

207
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,380
I figured he wasn't
in class all week

208
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,299
because he was
on Buddy Police biz.

209
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,717
You don't think
he's been defeated

210
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,719
by a Hundred Demons monster?

211
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,429
We considered it, but if he was,

212
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,432
I'm sure they would've
contacted us to brag about it.

213
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,392
I just really hope he
hasn't gotten himself

214
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,312

00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,647
There's just one hour
until the party begins,

216

what the big news is.

217
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,152
The whole world is
anxiously awaiting

218

Lady Suzuha Amanosuzu's
big announcement.

219
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,158
That's all they've talked
about on the news lately.

220
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,493
Any word from Mikado yet?

221
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,162
Strangely, no.

222
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,496
Where can he be?

223
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,248
We've reached out
to his friends,

224
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,667
even Miss Amanosuzu, but
with all that's going on,

225
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,502
she's too busy to speak to us.

226
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,005
Really? Would you say
they were close friends?

227
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:54,839
Yes.

228
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,257
Something's off.

229
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,926
If a close friend
of yours went missing,

230

wouldn't you be at
least a bit concerned?

00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,228
Ravenous fiends
walking a wicked path,

353
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,063
witness their awesome power!

354
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,775
Luminize, Hundred Dungeon!

355
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,527
Welcome to this special report.

356
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,906
A Darkness Barrier has just been
raised at Chateau de Amanosuzu.

357
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,741
I will be broadcasting
live from the scene,

358
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,702
where the exhausted Gao Mikado

359
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,537
has accepted
a Buddyfight challenge

360
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,414
from the notorious Death Shido.

361
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,416
Stay with us for
this doubleheader.

Are you with me, Paruko?

363
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,752
You know I am.

364
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,423
Alrighty then,
Buddy... fight!

365
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,508
Time to raise the flag!

366
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,094
I'm with Dragon World!

367
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,055
I'm fighting for Dungeon World.

368
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,724
Gao has the first move,

369
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,810
and he calls Crimson Battler,
Break Shoulder Dragon.

370
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,855
Come on, Break Shoulder,
attack the fighter!

371
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:26,897
You got it.

372
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,066
Give me a break, that was weak.

373
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:33,738
I cast Divine
Protection of Shalsana!

374
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,239
With his counter
spell's ability,

375
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,033
Death Shido regains
one life point,

376
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,410
and with that,
Gao's move is over.

377
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,912
Things are heating up
at the dungeon stage.

378
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,791
Count Dawn is preparing to
dazzle us with his first turn.

I call Night Witch
Clear to the left,

380

Tell me what to do already.

And now, I Buddy Call myself
to the right position!

385
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,516
The Buddy Gift helps him
regain one life point.

386
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,602
I'm anxious to know what
kind of ability he has.

387
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,729
Time for my trusty Takoscope.

388
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:10,441
Let's check out his
deets together, shall we?

389
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,027
Seventh Omni
Earthlord, Count Dawn.

390
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,737
Hang on a second.

391
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,490
Why do I feel like I've heard
that name somewhere before?

392
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,408
Anyway, he's just a size 0,

393
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,661
but he has the Wydar
Sarkal attribute.

394
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,914
He has 4,000 power, 1,000
defense, a critical of 1,

395
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,791
and one ability.

396
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,167
I wonder if he'll show us

397
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,211
the hidden strength
of the Buddy Police.

398
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,672
Feel the power!

399

All right, boys.

Watch me clear the way!

401
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,721
Oh no you don't.

Think again, you brute!

End of move.

407
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,653
So this is Count Dawn's
fighting style.

What's up with Suzuha's deck?

409
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,156
You noticed that too?

410
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,158
It's different
from her usual one.

411
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,370
And check out her Buddy,
that is not Mary Sue.

412

I call Zafar to the center,
and Zagan to the left, bia.

413
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,294
Lady Suzuha uses Nice One to
increase the cards in her hand,

414
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,046
but the ability of
Count Dawn's monsters

415
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,589
prevents them from
being destroyed

416
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,841

Wydar Sarkal monster

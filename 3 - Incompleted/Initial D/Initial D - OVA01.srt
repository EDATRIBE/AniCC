1
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,041
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,291
- ( tires squeal, engine revs )

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,041
- ( pop music playing )

4
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,958
- YOU DIDN'T HIT THAT CORNER
TIGHT ENOUGH, MAKO.

5
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,041
- ( gasps )

6
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,666
- I'D EXPECT A TIGHTER
LINE FROM YOU.

7
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,250
I KNOW YOU'RE
BETTER THAN THAT.

8
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,250
YOU'RE OFF BY LIKE
FIVE INCHES.

9
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,291
- YEAH, I KNOW.

10
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,875
- HMM?

11
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,750
HEY, LOOK.
SOMEONE'S COMING DOWN THE PASS.

12
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,458
MAKO'S SIL-EIGHTY!
SHE ROCKS THIS PASS.

13
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,000
- SO FREAKING COOL.

14
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,666
- NOTHING MOVES SWEETER
THAN USUI'S FASTEST.

15
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,375
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED
"IMPACT BLUE."

16
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:30,166
- Sayuki:
OH, YOU SUCK TONIGHT!

17
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,291
THIS CRAP DRIVING'S
NOT LIKE YOU, MAKO.

18
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,583
CONCENTRATE. WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THAT HEAD OF YOURS, HUH? 

19
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,583
Sayuki: SO THAT'S HOW
IT ALL WENT DOWN.

20
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,083
I WAS WONDERING.

21
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,833
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU GOT DUMPED

22
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,291
BY IKETANI. YOU'RE SO WAY
OUT OF HIS LEAGUE ANYWAY.

23
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,333
- I KNOW.

24
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,041
YOU'VE SAID THAT BEFORE,
BUT STILL.

25
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,333
- IT'S COMING TOGETHER
FOR ME NOW.

26
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,583
NO WONDER YOU'VE BEEN
DRIVING LIKE A LOOSE CANNON.

27
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,333
YOU'RE THE TYPE OF PERSON
WHO'S DRIVING MIRRORS

28
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,125
EXACTLY HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

29
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,250
RACING WITH YOUR EMOTIONS,
THAT'S YOUR STYLE.

30
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,500
- Yuuichi:
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?!

31
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,375
- ( gasps )
- BEING IN LOVE MEANS

32
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,458
YOU ACCEPT EVERYTHING 
ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON

33
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,250
THE WAY THEY ARE. I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT LOVE'S ALL ABOUT.

34
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,250
- ( stammers )

35
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,041
- YOU WON'T KNOW IF
SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU OR NOT

36
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,541
TILL YOU GO.
NOW GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW

37
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,166
OR YOU'RE FIRED.
- ( groans )

38
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,416
-  MEET ME AT 8:00
AT THE KAMAMESHI BILLBOARD

39
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,625
WHERE WE MET.
I'LL BE THERE.

40
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,166
- Iketani:
BOSS IS RIGHT.  I'M SO STUPID.

41
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,708
SHE WAS ALWAYS
STRAIGHT UP WITH ME.

42
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,416
BUT I COULDN'T DO IT BACK.

43
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,625
I'M SUCH A JACKASS.

44
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,833
- MY FEET ARE KILLING ME.

45
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,625
I HATE HEELS.

46
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,833
- OH, PLEASE, PLEASE.

47
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,416
JUST ONE MORE CHANCE.

48
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,833
( gasps )

49
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,833
NO!  THERE'S AN ACCIDENT?

50
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,416
- ( crying )

51
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,333
I'M NEVER WEARING
HIGH HEELS AGAIN.

52
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,416
- ( engine starts )

53
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,333
- ( tires screech )

54
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,708
- I CAN'T FATHOM HOW ANYONE
WOULD WANT TO BREAK UP WITH YOU.

55
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,375
YOU'RE AWESOME.
AND HE LOOKED LIKE

56
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,000
HE WAS OVER THE MOON
CRAZY FOR YOU TOO.

57
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,000
BUT I GUESS THAT'S
GUYS FOR YOU.

58
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,958
MAYBE YOU TWO GOT
YOUR MEETING TIMES MIXED UP?

59
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,666
- I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT, SO I
STAYED THERE WAITING FOR HIM.

60
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,416
I WAS THERE FOREVER AFTER
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET,

61
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,000
BUT NOTHING.

62
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,416
- AND THE JERK NEVER
EVEN BOTHERED TO CALL YOU?

63
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,916
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CALL HIM?

64
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,333
- I COULDN'T BE THAT FORWARD.
YOU KNOW THAT.

65
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,166
BESIDES, AFTER WAITING THERE
FOR THREE EXTRA HOURS,

66
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,708
I WAS HUMILIATED.

67
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,416
AND THE FACT THAT
HE HASN'T EVEN BOTHERED

68
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,250
TO CALL ME AFTER THAT NIGHT?

69
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,458
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT MEANS
HE'S NOT INTERESTED.

70
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,083
- ( sighs )

71
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,916
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE
REALLY STOKED OVER THIS GUY.

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
THAT REALLY SUCKS.

73
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,833
STOKED ENOUGH THAT IT 
JACKED WITH HOW YOU'RE

74
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,666
HANDLING YOURSELF
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

75
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,750
- YEAH.  AND I WAS READY TO
HAND IT ALL OVER TO HIM.

76
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,666
- HUH?  HAND WHAT?

77
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,333
- ME.

78
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,416
- ( coughing )

79
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,958
I CAN'T TELL IF YOU'RE
SOME NAIVE LITTLE GIRL

80
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,708
OR A WALKING SET OF
BRASS BALLS.

81
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,208
I REALLY CAN'T.

82
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,708
YOU GOTTA FILL ME IN.

83
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,791
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT THIS GUY ANYWAY?

84
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,541
- IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

85
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,125
HE'S SINCERE AND GENTLE.

86
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,583
HE WAS NEVER PUSHY.

87
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,541
WHENEVER WE STARTED
TALKING ABOUT CARS,

88
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,125
TIMES JUST SOARED BY.

89
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,541
WE MUST HAVE REALLY
GOTTEN INTO IT.

90
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,958
THAT WAS JUST PART OF
THE MAGIC, I GUESS.

91
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,000
- ( cellphone ringing )

92
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,166
- THIS IS SAYUKI.

93
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,000
SHINGO, LONG TIME NO TALK.

94
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,125
HOW'S THE BIG BAD WORLD
BEEN TREATING YOU LATELY?

95
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,416
- JUST FINE.

96
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,208
BUT THIS ISN'T A SOCIAL CALL.

97
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,000
- WHAT?  ARE YOU SERIOUS?

98
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,375
WHAT'S THE LAN-EVO SQUAD
DOING IN MYOGI?

99
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,583
- I'M WONDERING IF THE NEWS
HAD REACHED YOU YET.

100
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,000
LAN-EVO'S WITH TOCHIGI PLATES
SHOWED IN MYOGI

101
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,000
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

102
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,833
- THAT'S OKAY.

103
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:47,000
- I HEAR THE NIGHT KIDS
LOST THEIR ASSES TO THEM TOO.

104
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,041
COURSE IT WAS THAT IDIOT,
TAKESHI.

105
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,375
HAD TO LOSE TO THOSE SPEED
MONKEYS ON OUR HOME TURF.

106
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,041
- I KNOW WHO
THESE GUYS ARE.

107
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,041
A FELLOW NAMED KYOICHI SUDO
IS THEIR LEADER.

108
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,875
HE'S AN EXCELLENT RACER
WHO HAILS FROM

109
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,500
THE NIKKO IROHAZAKA COURSE.

110
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,791
- ( gasps )

111
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,125
- I KNOW YOU'RE HERE NOW,
KYOICHI.

112
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,250
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHAT DO
YOU HAVE UP YOUR SLEEVE?

113
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,583
- WE SHOULD DO THIS
MORE OFTEN, SHINGO.

114
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,750
- YEAH.

115
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,625
- IF YOU DIDN'T 
KNOW IT ALREADY,

116
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,541
THE NIGHT KIDS ARE 
A JOKE AROUND HERE.

117
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,041
- WELL, THAT'S A HELL OF A NICE
WAY TO GREET AN OLD FRIEND.

118
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,208
TAKESHI, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET SAYUKI.

119
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,500
WE GREW UP TOGETHER.

120
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,083
- HOW YOU DOING?

121
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,166
- Takeshi:
DAMN, SHE'S HOT.

122
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,416
- YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD IT
ALREADY THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE,

123
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,166
BUT TAKESHI'S THE ONE
WHO RACED 'EM.

124
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,666
- GLAD TO MEET YOU.

125
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,666
- CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
LOST TO THOSE DUDES

126
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,625
ON YOUR HOME TURF. HOW COULD
YOU DO SOMETHING SO STUPID? 

127
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,750
- ( exhales )

128
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,500
Takeshi: I AM HERE
TO DEFEND GUNMA TONIGHT.

129
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,666
AND BEFORE I'M DONE,
YOU'RE GONNA FIND YOURSELF

130
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,458
BURIED DEEP AT THE BOTTOM
OF MYOGI VALLEY.

131
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,458
- ( chuckles )

132
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,291
- WHAT?

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,333
Takeshi: I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

134
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,875
BUT WE STILL GOT
A LONG WAY TO GO

135
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,500
BEFORE THE FINISH LINE.

136
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,666
IF I DON'T STOP THESE GUYS...

137
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,333
THEN WHO THE HELL ELSE
IS GONNA BE ABLE TO?! 

138
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,708
( gasps )

139
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,666
( grunts )

140
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,208
AAH!

141
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,708
- ( gasping )

142
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,666
- ( chuckles )

143
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,416
- THEY'RE A TEAM OF
LAN-EVO RACERS.

144
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,458
CALL THEMSELVES
"THE EMPERORS."

145
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,166
IT ALL WENT DOWN AFTER TAKESHI
HAD LOST TO THE RED SUNS

146
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,000
IN AN UPHILL RACE.

147
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,166
I DON'T THINK HE'D FULLY
GOTTEN OVER GETTING WHOOPED YET.

148
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,666
HE MUST HAVE BEEN FEELING
PRETTY OUT OF SYNC

149
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,750
TO FAIL TWICE LIKE THAT.
- WHATEVER.

150
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,250
- HE'S NOT THE MOST CONSISTENT
PERSON ON THE PLANET,

151
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,958
AND HE CERTAINLY
FOLDS UNDER PRESSURE.

152
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,458
- TELL YOU WHAT, SHINGO,

153
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,958
YOU DON'T YOU PUT
A FREAKING CORK IN IT?

154
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,791
- BUT NOBODY CAN DRIVE
A THREE-TWO LIKE HE CAN.

155
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,625
I GOTTA GIVE HIM THAT MUCH.

156
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,791
IN FACT, I'D SAY HE'S PROBABLY
THE BEST THREE-TWO RACER

157
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,791
WE GOT AROUND OUR REGION.

158
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,625
BUT EVEN HE COULDN'T 
KEEP UP WITH THE FIRE

159
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,625
BURNING OFF THE BACK
OF THAT LAN-EVO,

160
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,250
WHICH LETS YOU KNOW
JUST HOW FAST THEY ARE.

161
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,291
THEY SAID TO
GIVE THEM A MONTH

162
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,791
AND THEY'D KNOCK OUT
ALL THE COMPETITION IN GUNMA.

163
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,541
SOONER OR LATER 
THEY'LL BE HERE.

164
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,375
SO YOU BETTER
WATCH YOUR BACK, SAYUKI.

165
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,875
MYOGI'S CLOSE TO USUI.

166
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,708
IT WON'T TAKE MUCH
FOR THEM TO GET TO YOU.

167
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,250
- I KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

168
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,833
- ( gasps )

169
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,208
- PEOPLE DON'T CALL US
IMPACT BLUE

170
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,625
BECAUSE WE SIT ON OUR ASSES

171
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,958
AND LET EVERY LOSER
WHO COMES THROUGH

172
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,583
ROLL OVER US.

173
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,583
- Takeshi:
MAN, THIS CHICK IS AGGRESSIVE.

174
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,583
- I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU.
GIVE YOU A LITTLE HEADS UP.

175
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,250
YOU'RE BETTER OFF
AVOIDING THESE GUYS.

176
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,625
YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW
TO TRUST WHAT I'M SAYING.

177
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,250
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
GETTING AT WITH THAT, SHINGO?

178
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,333
YOU THINK WE'RE NOT GOOD
ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE JERKS,

179
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,583
IS THAT IT?

180
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,916
- I WOULDN'T SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT TO YOU.

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,916
YOU KNOW ME
BETTER THAN THAT.

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,083
- ( both gasp )

183
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,708
- Takeshi: BOUNCY.

184
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,750
- WE MIGHT JUST
BE CHICKS TO YOU,

185
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,083
BUT DON'T COUNT US OUT.

186
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,833
WE DON'T BACK DOWN
FROM ANYONE.

187
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,291
NEVER HAVE, NEVER WILL.

188
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,666
- ( stammers )

189
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,000
- YEAH, I BELIEVE YOU.

190
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,666
- IS THAT ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY TO ME?

191
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,375
GREAT, THEN I'M LEAVING.

192
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,875
- SHE CAN BE SUCH
A STUBBORN PAIN IN THE ASS.

193
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,250
DON'T YOU COME
CRYING TO ME, OKAY?

194
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,083
SO IN CASE YOU HADN'T
FIGURED IT OUT,

195
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,958
I BROUGHT YOU HERE
'CAUSE I WANTED HER TO KNOW

196
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,458
JUST HOW DANGEROUS
THE EMPERORS ARE. 

197
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,875
YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST
TRIED TO HELP OUT.

198
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,666
EARTH TO MORON,
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?

199
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,708
- DUDE.

200
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,833
SHE'S SO HOT.

201
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,333
- HMM?

202
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,666
- ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
DON'T ASK ME WHERE I HEARD IT,

203
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,666
BUT I KNOW THAT
A LAN-EVO TEAM 

204
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,416
CALLED THE EMPERORS ARE PLANNING
TO PULL AN ATTACK ON GUNMA.

205
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,708
- A BUDDY OF MINE WAS TELLING
ME ABOUT THAT THE OTHER DAY.

206
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,125
IT SEEMS EVERYONE'S BEEN
TALKING ABOUT THEM LATELY.

207
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,125
- YEAH.  I HEARD SOME CRAP
ABOUT THEM CUTTING

208
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,791
THE NIGHT KIDS 
STICKER IN HALF

209
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,750
AND PUTTING IT UPSIDE DOWN
ON ONE OF THEIR SPOILERS. 

210
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,666
SOME KIND OF
VICTORY THING THEY DO.

211
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,333
- WHO WOULD PULL THAT?

212
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,166
- YOU REALLY THINK THEY'RE
GONNA COME UP HERE?

213
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,416
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO 
IF THEY SHOW UP, SAYUKI?

214
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,208
YOU GONNA TAKE 'EM ON?

215
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,833
- YOU KNOW, DUDE,
THAT'S A REALLY STUPID QUESTION.

216
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,125
WOULDN'T YOU SAY SO, MAKO?

217
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,333
- YEP.  ANY CHALLENGE
IS WORTH TAKING.

218
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,083
WE'RE THE FASTEST 
USUI HAS TO OFFER.

219
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,916
THEY DON'T CALL US 
IMPACT BLUE BECAUSE

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,250
WE DRAG AROUND THE CURVES.

221
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,833
- SO THAT'S WHERE WE STAND.

222
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,833
BUT WE NEED YOU GUYS 
TO HELP US OUT, OKAY?

223
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,250
THE SECOND ANY ONE OF YOU
SEES THOSE LAN-EVOS,

224
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,250
CALL ME ON MY CELL AND TELL
ME EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE

225
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,666
SO WE CAN TAKE THEM DOWN.

226
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,208
- ( cheering )

227
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,708
- IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS
AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN 

228
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,916
OR HEARD A THING FROM
THE LAN-EVO GUYS.

229
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,375
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT
COMING HERE TO USUI.

230
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,375
I HAVE TO BE HONEST
WITH MYSELF.

231
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,958
THERE'S A BIG PART OF ME
THAT'LL FEEL A HUGE RELIEF

232
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:45,916
IF THEY DON'T.

233
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,000
I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN
AT THE TOP OF MY GAME LATELY.

234
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,791
AND IF I HAD TO SQUARE OFF
AGAINST THEM TONIGHT,

235
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,958
I'M SURE IT WOULDN'T BE
THE BEST RACE I'VE EVER RUN.

236
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,333
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

237
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,416
BUT I WANT TO CLEAR
THIS HAZE FROM MY MIND.

238
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,000
SOMEHOW.

239
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,416
I JUST WANT TO FORGET
ABOUT IKETANI.

240
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,916
I WANT THAT REJECTION
OUT OF MY MIND.

241
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,958
- COME ON!

242
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,958
- ( Mako screams )

243
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,458
SAYUKI, WHAT IS THIS?

244
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,333
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
JUST WHAT IN THE HELL 

245
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,958
YOU'RE DOING IN MY BATHROOM?

246
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,666
- ARE YOU STUPID?
THIS ISN'T THE TIME

247
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,958
FOR YOU TO BE LOUNGING
IN THE FREAKING BATH. 

248
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,208
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

249
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,250
- I CAME TO PICK YOU UP. 
WE'RE BLOWING THIS JOINT.

250
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,708
NOW MOVE YOUR ASS.

251
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,458
- I DON'T GET IT.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

252
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,083
- UP TO USUI PASS.

253
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,666
THE LAN-EVO JERKS
JUST ROLLED INTO TOWN.

254
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,958
- ( gasps )

255
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,041
- HURRY AND PUT ON SOME 
UNDERWEAR FOR GOD SAKES.

256
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,458
- JUST GIVE ME A SECOND,
YOU FREAK!

257
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,958
- LAN-EVOS COMING UP
THE MOUNTAIN, GUYS. 

258
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,958
- OH, MAN.
IT'S THE EMPERORS ALL RIGHT.

259
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,541
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY ACTUALLY SHOWED UP.

260
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,916
- WE NEED TO CALL
SAYUKI AND MAKO NOW.

261
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,875
- YEAH.

262
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,958
- FOR REAL?
THE LAN-EVOS JUST SHOWED UP?

263
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,500
- SAME DAMN EMPEROR JAG-OFFS
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT EARLIER.

264
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,083
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
UP THERE RIGHT NOW,

265
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,791
AND I THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT TO KNOW.

266
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,083
- THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP.
- ( cellphone beeps )

267
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,541
- HEY, TAKESHI.

268
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,625
THE LAN-EVO SQUAD
JUST SHOWED UP IN USUI.

269
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,125
- YOU SCREWING WITH ME?

270
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,708
- I'M NOT.
NOW LET'S GO.

271
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,250
- YOU GOT IT.

272
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,125
- Rourke: ALL I SEE IS
A BUNCH OF DRIFT PUNKS

273
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,458
WITH DUMBASS LOOKS
ON THEIR FACES.

274
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,125
GUNMA DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
SUCH A KILLER PLACE

275
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,375
FOR REAL RACERS.
THIS IS AMATEUR HOUR.

276
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,208
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
AND TELL KYOICHI

277
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,416
HE'S GOT AN EASY KILL WAITING.
- SURE.

278
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:33,958
HUH?

279
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,166
- HOW YOU FELLAS DOING?

280
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,000
IF YOU CAME
LOOKING FOR A RACE,

281
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,000
WE'LL TAKE THE CHALLENGE
'CAUSE OUR SIL-EIGHTY

282
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,833
IS THE FASTEST CAR YOU'LL 
FIND ANYWHERE AROUND HERE.

283
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:14,791
- ( gasps )

284
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,500
- HEY, I GOT A QUESTION.
ANYTHING GOING ON

285
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,166
BETWEEN YOU AND THAT
SIL-EIGHTY CHICK?

286
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,916
I COULDN'T REALLY TELL
AT THE RESTAURANT.

287
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,583
- HMM.
ME AND SAYUKI, YOU SERIOUS?

288
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,583
NAH, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

289
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,041
THE TWO OF US HAVE BEEN FRIENDS
SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

290
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,208
WE LIVED NEAR EACH OTHER,
WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOLS,

291
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,250
THAT KIND OF STUFF, YOU KNOW.
WE'RE JUST REGULAR FRIENDS, MAN.

292
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,208
- THAT'S COOL.
- I KNOW.

293
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,625
OH, I JUST PUT IT TOGETHER.

294
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,291
YOU TOTALLY DIG
AGGRESSIVE CHICKS, DON'T YOU?

295
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,333
- UH-- WELL...

296
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,125
- FORGET HER. SHE'S A
STRONG-WILLED PAIN IN THE ASS

297
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,166
WHO'LL WALK ALL OVER YOU.

298
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,625
YEAH, SHE DOESN'T LISTEN TO
ANYTHING ANYONE ELSE HAS TO SAY.

299
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,958
DOES HER OWN THING.

300
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,625
EVEN IF THEY ARE
THE FASTEST IN USUI,

301
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,625
THEY DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST THE LAN-EVOS.

302
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,208
SHE THINKS THEY'RE GONNA BE
EASY TO WHIP, BUT SHE'S WRONG.

303
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,208
EVEN I CAN ADMIT
THEIR DRIFT TECHNIQUE

304
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,458
IS AN AMAZING THING,
FOR FREAKING REAL.

305
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,875
THERE'S PROBABLY
NO ONE IN USUI

306
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,708
WHO COULD HOLD A CANDLE
TO THOSE CHICKS.

307
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,083
BUT WITH PURE SPEED RACING,
THEY GOT NO EXPERIENCE.

308
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,833
THAT KIND OF DRIVING
REQUIRES CONTROL

309
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,583
THAT'S SIMPLY
OUT OF THEIR REACH.

310
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,666
THEIR CONTROL'S GOOD, YEAH.

311
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,416
BUT IT'S NOT-- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST NOT CRISP ENOUGH. 

312
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,375
THEY'LL BE OUTCLASSED
BY A SERIOUS FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

313
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,250
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

314
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,291
YOU'VE BEEN THERE.

315
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,666
AND I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE 
SLOW BECAUSE THEY'RE CHICKS

316
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,833
OR ANYTHING
TOTALLY STUPID LIKE THAT.

317
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,666
I JUST KNOW THE FACTS
AS THEY STAND.

318
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,666
- OH, SO YOU'RE IN
A SIL-EIGHTY, HUH?

319
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,041
AND YOU'RE CHICKS TO BOOT.
THAT'S FUN.

320
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,208
LOOKS LIKE A GOOD TIME.
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE PLAY

321
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,666
A LITTLE ROUND-AND-ROUND?

322
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,125
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

323
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,791
KYOICHI WILL KICK YOUR ASS.

324
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,208
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT 
WHY WE'RE HERE, MAN.

325
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,791
WE CAME UP HERE
TO SCOUT THE PLACE,

326
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,458
AND THAT'S ALL
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

327
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,041
- SHUT UP.  DON'T BE SUCH
A BUZZ-KILL, NANCY.

328
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,208
I MEAN WE CAME ALL THE WAY
UP HERE, DIDN'T WE?

329
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,500
SO BACK OFF.

330
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,000
I DON'T SEE THE DAMAGE IN US

331
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,708
HAVING A LITTLE FUN
WHILE WE'RE AT IT. 

332
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,500
AS LONG AS I WIN.

333
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,125
- SURE, DUDE.
BUT WHAT IF THEY'RE GOOD

334
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,416
AND YOU ACTUALLY
LOSE TO THEM?

335
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,958
- DON'T INSULT ME.

336
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,291
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND
EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME, REN.

337
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,875
HOW COULD MY BADASS EVO FOUR
LOSE TO A COUPLE OF

338
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,000
HAIRSPRAY SNORTING BIMBOS
LIKE THOSE TWO CHICKS?

339
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,166
- HEAR THAT, MAKO?
HE SCREWED UP NOW.

340
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,583
THAT'LL BE THE LAST
DUMB THING HE SAYS TODAY.

341
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,416
- PEOPLE WHO
INSULT WOMEN RACERS

342
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,000
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE WOMEN
ARE THE WORST KIND OF JERKS.

343
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,958
SO THAT'S THE LAST STRAW.
WE'RE NOT GOING EASY ON YOU.

344
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,916
- ( engine starts, revs )

345
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,333
- Sayuki: HER EYES GOT
THAT SERIOUS LOOK IN THEM.

346
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,333
SHE'S FASTER THAN A HYDROPLANER
WHEN SHE LOOKS LIKE THAT.

347
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,708
'CAUSE THAT'S WHEN
HER EMOTIONS FUEL HER.

348
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,750
WE'RE GONNA RUN 
A DOWNHILL RACE.

349
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,333
AND SINCE USUI'S
A NARROW COURSE,

350
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,750
WE'RE GONNA DO IT
CAT-AND-MOUSE STYLE.

351
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,166
I'M SURE YOU'RE
FAMILIAR WITH IT.

352
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,375
IF THE MOUSE GETS AWAY,
IT'S OVER.

353
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,875
IF NOT, WE KEEP SWITCHING
UNTIL SOMEONE WINS.

354
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,791
YOU COOL WITH THAT?

355
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,875
- THAT'LL WORK.

356
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,125
- JUST TELL ME WHICH
POSITION YOU WANT FIRST.

357
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,583
SINCE YOU'RE THE OUTSIDER,
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE CHOICE.

358
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,625
- YOU KNOW, I'LL FOLLOW YOU
ON THE FIRST RUN.

359
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,625
THAT WAY I CAN CHECK OUT WHAT
YOU'RE MADE OF FROM BEHIND.

360
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,791
- SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE
READY TO GET STARTED THEN.

361
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,208
AFTER WE EXIT THE FIRST TURN,

362
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,625
WE'LL KICK IT UP
TO FULL SPEED.

363
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,291
THAT'LL BE THE START
OF THE RACE.

364
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,208
THINK YOU'RE CAPABLE
OF REMEMBERING ALL OF THAT?

365
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,791
OR IS THAT TOO MUCH?

366
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:50,791
- I'M GOOD.  LET'S DO IT.

367
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,291
- HEY, YOU GONNA BE OKAY
DOING THIS ALONE?

368
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,375
- DIDN'T I JUST SAY
A SECOND AGO THAT I WAS GOOD?

369
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,291
I'M ONE OF THE TOP 
RACERS ON OUR TEAM.

370
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,750
HE'LL, PAL, I'M EVEN
BETTER THAN YOU.

371
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,833
I'M MORE THAN POSITIVE
THAT MY EVO FOUR

372
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,666
IS GONNA WIPE THE ROAD
WITH SOME LAME-ASS SIL-EIGHTY

373
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,541
DRIVEN BY TWO CHICKS.

374
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,333
- ( engines revving )

375
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,875
- RIGHT.  LET'S GO.

376
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,708
- WE'VE GOT THIS IN THE BAG.

377
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,875
I'M NOT LOSING TO SOME GUY 
WHO INSULTS FEMALE DRIVERS.

378
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,291
- YOU LOOK READY. YOU REALLY
THINK YOU'RE UP FOR THIS?

379
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,666
- WHENEVER YOU ARE, SAYUKI.

380
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,166
- HIT THE GAS.

381
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,875
- HUH.  SHOULD BE AN EASY WIN.

382
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,791
EVEN ON ITS WORST DAY,
HIS EVO FOUR

383
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,208
WOULD NEVER LOSE TO SOME
SPENT SIL-EIGHTY.

384
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,791
- I'M SURPRISED THEY'RE
REALLY GOING THROUGH WITH THIS.

385
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,041
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,
WOMEN CAN HAVE A HELL OF A LOT

386
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,458
MORE COURAGE THAN MEN DO.

387
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,041
- BUT CAN THEY
BEAT THE EMPERORS?

388
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,791
I MEAN, THOSE GUYS LAID WASTE
TO THE NIGHT KIDS

389
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,291
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

390
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,791
- THAT EVO FOUR IS AN 
EXTREMELY HIGH-POWERED

391
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,333
FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

392
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,875
ANYONE ELSE
WOULD HAVE RUN AWAY.

393
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,041
BUT IF SAYUKI AND MAKO
CAN'T WIN,

394
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,875
THEN I CAN'T THINK OF ANYBODY
WHO'S GOT THE SKILLS

395
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,750
OR THE CAR TO DO IT.
- RIGHT.

396
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,833
AND I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS 
THAT NAMED THEM IMPACT BLUE,

397
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,333
BUT THEY CERTAINLY
DESERVED IT.

398
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,791
THEY'RE USUI'S FASTEST
BY A MILE.

399
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,833
- ALL WE CAN DO NOW
IS BELIEVE IN THEM.

400
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,500
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE
WE BOTH HAVE FAITH

401
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,083
IN ONE CENTRAL THING:

402
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,458
THAT THE SIL-EIGHTY
IS THE BEST HERE.

403
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,500
- NOT BAD FOR A COUPLE
OF DUMB CHICKS,

404
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,416
BUT IT'S THEIR COURSE
SO THEY KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE

405
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,375
HOW TO ATTACK IT.

406
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,500
- NO CARS AHEAD OF US, GIRL.
YOU CAN KICK IT OUT

407
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,500
AND DRIFT RIGHT ON
THROUGH THIS CORNER.

408
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,375
- ( chuckles )
MY EVO FOUR'S DRIFT

409
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,500
IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY
PIECE OF CRAP FR'S DRIFT

410
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,958
BY A LONG SHOT.

411
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,541
WHAT I GOT IS A HIGH-SPEED
FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE DRIFT

412
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,958
WITH AN ENGINE
ALWAYS ON FULL BLAST.

413
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,875
- ( tires screech )

414
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,208
- ( gasps ) MAKO,
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, SISTER.

415
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:33,541
GRIP THE NEXT CORNER
AND HUG THE INNER WALL.

416
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,125
YOU'LL SKIP LIKE A STONE.

417
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:45,166
SO FAR WE'RE ABOUT EVEN.

418
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,000
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S
THE EVO FOUR ITSELF,

419
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:52,166
OR THE DRIVER'S TECHNIQUE THAT'S
LETTING HIM KEEP UP WITH US.

420
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,833
- IT'S LIKE YOU WERE
SAYING EARLIER,

421
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,833
THE SWINGING DRIFT INVOLVES
SO MANY VARIABLES

422
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,666
YOU KIND OF HAVE TO BE 
A MASTER OF ALL TRADES.

423
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,291
EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON 
HOW YOU USE THE TIRES.

424
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,125
- YEAH.

425
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:10,000
- SO WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW THIS SIL-EIGHTY RACE?

426
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,583
HAS IT BEEN LIKE
YEARS OR WHAT?

427
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,416
- NO, IT'S BEEN
SINCE LAST SPRING.

428
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,250
- THEN MAYBE HER DRIVING STYLE'S
CHANGED A LITTLE BIT.

429
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,666
- HUH?

430
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,833
- I'VE EXPERIENCED IT TOO,
YOU KNOW.

431
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,250
AFTER A HORRIFYING LOSS,
EVEN THE BEST RACER

432
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,000
CAN REALLY CHANGE HIS TONE.

433
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,625
SOMETIMES FOR THE BETTER,
AND SOMETIMES FOR THE WORSE.

434
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,708
- YEAH.

435
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,041
- THERE ARE PLENTY OF
TALENTED RACERS IN THE WORLD.

436
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:35,041
LIKE AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX.
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

437
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,875
THAT'S AN FR RACER WHO
COULD BEAT THE PANTS

438
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,250
OFF A FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE.

439
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,583
- BUT THAT EIGHT-SIX
IS AN EXCEPTION NOT THE RULE,

440
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,083
YOU KNOW THAT.

441
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,416
IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
BEEN A DIFFERENT STORY

442
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,125
IF THOSE GIRLS HAD
EVEN HAD A CHANCE 

443
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,208
TO SEE THE EIGHT-SIX
RACE BEFORE, BUT THEY HAVEN'T.

444
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,666
THEY'RE BLIND TO WHAT
THEY'VE GOTTEN INTO. 

445
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,375
- ( chuckles )
STUPID WOMEN DRIVERS.

446
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,458
JUST PLAIN DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

447
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:08,416
- Mako: I'M NOT LOSING
TO THIS CREEP NO MATTER WHAT.

448
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,250
- Sayuki: THIS IS UNREAL.

449
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,541
HER DRIVING IS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOW.

450
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,500
HER STEERING'S DEFINITELY
GOTTEN WAY BETTER.

451
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,833
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE RACE
AGAINST THE EIGHT-SIX.

452
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,500
THAT HAD TO HAVE BEEN
WHAT TIGHTENED THE SCREWS

453
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,500
ON HER SKILLS.

454
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,416
SHE'S COMPLETELY OPENED
HER EYES AS A DRIVER

455
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,083
LIKE SHE'S NEVER
DONE BEFORE.

456
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,875
YOU CAN DO THIS, MAKO.
THIS RACE IS YOURS TO LOSE.

457
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,500
- ( tires screech )

458
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,333
- THAT EVO FOUR ISN'T AS SHARP
AT THE CORNERS AS WE ARE.

459
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,875
DUDE'S NOT AS GREAT
AS I THOUGHT HE'D BE.

460
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:12,625
10-TO-ONE SAYS HE'S 
NOT THE GUY WHO BEAT

461
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,833
THE NIGHT KIDS IN MYOGI.
HAD TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.

462
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:20,291
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I'D HATE TO KEEP

463
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,125
LETTING HIM
STARE AT OUR ASS.

464
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,708
WE'RE FINISHING HIM OFF
AT THE NEXT CORNER.

465
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:26,250
THAT'S C-121.

466
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:30,041
I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING
YOU ALREADY KNOW,

467
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,333
BUT YOU'RE A HELL OF
A LOT FASTER

468
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,750
ON THE STRAIGHTAWAYS TONIGHT.

469
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,416
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE
ENTERING THE CORNER

470
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,416
AT A MUCH HIGHER SPEED
THAN YOU'RE USED TO,

471
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,833
SO DON'T FORGET
TO ADJUST FOR THAT

472
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:39,000
WHEN WE GET THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

473
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,666
EXCELLENT.
NO CARS AHEAD.

474
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,500
TIME TO NAIL IT.  GO!

475
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,000
- ( grunts )
IF THOSE FREAKING CHICKS

476
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,416
CAN CLEAR THAT CORNER
THAT EASY,

477
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,333
THEN MY EVO FOUR
CAN DO IT NO SWEAT.

478
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:03,458
HERE I COME!

479
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,791
I'M GOING TOO WIDE.

480
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,208
I CAN'T STAY ON
THE SAME LINE. 

481
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,166
I'M GONNA CRASH!

482
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,541
AAH!

483
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:42,791
- IT'S OVER, MAKO.

484
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,625
YOU BEAT HIM.

485
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,791
- DUDE, ARE YOU OKAY?

486
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,833
- HEY.  DO ME A FAVOR 
AND DON'T TELL KYOICHI

487
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:05,833
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.
IT'LL JUST BE BETWEEN US.

488
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:06,958
- UH...

489
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,708
- SAYUKI, WHAT'S UP? WHERE
THE HELL'S THE LAN-EVO SQUAD?

490
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,708
I THOUGHT THEY WERE HERE?

491
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:30,583
- AW, YOU'RE TOO LATE, SHINGO.

492
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,750
THE RACE IS ALREADY
SAID AND DONE.

493
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,416
- WHAT?

494
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,208
YOU'RE ALREADY FINISHED?

495
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,875
- THAT SUCKS.

496
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:39,708
BUT DON'T FEEL TOO
BAD ABOUT IT.

497
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:42,500
I MEAN, WE LOST ON
OUR OWN TURF TOO, YOU KNOW?

498
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,041
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, DUDE?

499
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,875
WE BEAT THEIR ASSES.

500
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,958
- ( both gasp )

501
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:52,875
- I SAID WE WHIPPED 
THEIR TAILS, STUPID.

502
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,333
- Shingo and Takeshi:
THEY WON?!

503
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:02,208
- MAKO WAS REALLY
SHINING TONIGHT. 

504
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:04,708
SHE'S A GENIUS
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

505
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:06,125
- CUT IT OUT.

506
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,625
- ( giggles )

507
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,583
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

508
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,083
SEE YOU AROUND, SHINGO.

509
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,666
- HEY, WAIT.  YOU KNOW,
WE CAME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

510
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,083
TO ROOT FOR YOU AND NOW
YOU'RE JUST GONNA RUN AWAY?

511
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:23,041
- ( engine starts )

512
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,791
- DUDE, THAT SIL-EIGHTY IS
GIVING OFF SOME SERIOUS VIBES,

513
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:34,750
I SWEAR.

514
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,916
THOSE CHICKS ARE
THE REAL DEAL.

515
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,916
- YOU ROCKED IT OUT
LAST NIGHT, MAKO.

516
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,500
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THE GUY
DRIVING THE LAN-EVO LAST NIGHT

517
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,208
WASN'T REALLY THAT
GOOD OF A RACER.

518
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,791
- THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.

519
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,166
HE ACTUALLY HAD A PRETTY
TIGHT GRIP ON HIS STYLE.

520
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,958
IF WE RACED HIM BEFORE
HE RACED AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX,

521
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,375
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A CHALLENGE FOR YOU,

522
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,125
BUT IT TIMED OUT JUST RIGHT.

523
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,375
LESS ANGLED CORNERING
HAS BEEN OUR FOCUS

524
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,625
EVER SINCE OUR LOSS. 
WE'RE GETTING BETTER.

525
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,083
AND YOU'VE PROVED THAT 
WITH EVERY SINGLE TURN.

526
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:27,375
BUT AT C-121 WHEN WE 
WENT IN FOR THE KILL,

527
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,541
YOU SLIPPED RIGHT BACK
INTO YOUR FLASHY,

528
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,666
DRAMATIC STYLE OF DRIFTING.

529
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,375
- I GUESS I ENTERED THAT CORNER 
A LOT FASTER THAN I SHOULD HAVE.

530
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,375
IT'S SAD. I'M ALMOST
GETTING NERVOUS

531
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,833
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT NOW.
( chuckles )

532
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:42,375
- WELL, IT SURE AS HELL WASN'T
FUNNY LAST NIGHT, OKAY?

533
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,833
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
FREAKING DIE.

534
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:48,000
I GOTTA SAY, YOU'RE ONE HECK
OF AN EMOTIONAL RACER, MAKO.

535
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,166
YOU CHANGE INTO SOMEONE ELSE
WHEN YOU GET BEHIND

536
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,833
THE WHEEL OF THAT CAR.

537
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:57,875
- I FEEL THIS HUGE
SENSE OF RELIEF RIGHT NOW.

538
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,416
BUT I STILL HAVE 
A LONG WAY TO GO.

539
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,000
LIKE I'M CHASING AFTER
SOMETHING THAT'S JUST 

540
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,000
WAY BEYOND THAT BLUE SKY,
YOU KNOW?

541
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,375
SOMETHING INTANGIBLE.

542
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:15,916
I'M NOT GONNA NEED
A MAN FOR A LONG TIME.

543
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,833
JUST YOU WATCH ME, IKETANI.

544
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:22,125
BANG.

545
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,708
- ( Iketani sneezes )

546
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,208
- YOU CATCH A COLD
OR SOMETHING?

547
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,458
'CAUSE YOU SOUND LIKE
ABSOLUTE HELL.

548
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,416
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M COOL.

549
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,791
- YOU'RE KIND OF WOBBLING
AS WE GO AROUND THE CURVES.

550
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,291
- I CAN'T HELP IT.  DAMN.

551
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,041
YESTERDAY'S SNOW 
HAS FROZEN SOLID,

552
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,666
AND IT'S MAKING ME
SLIDE ALL OVER THE ROAD.

553
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,541
GUESS MY STUDLESS TIRES
AREN'T REALLY

554
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:58,583
CUTTING THE MUSTARD
OUT HERE.

555
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,625
( gasps )

556
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,666
OH!

557
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,750
WHAT?
HOW'S THAT CAR DOING IT?

558
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:14,583
IT'S GOT STUDLESS TIRES TOO.

559
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,458
UNBELIEVABLE.

560
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:24,916
- Sayuki:
WHOA!  WATCH OUT!

561
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,708
WHOA!
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT!

562
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,708
AAH!

563
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:33,208
( screaming )

564
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:36,083
NOT AGAIN.
GO RIGHT, RIGHT!

565
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,208
NO!  NO!  CRAP.

566
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:39,666
OH, DAMN IT.

567
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,416
OH, WHY?

568
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,791
- SAYUKI, YOU COOL?

569
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,166
- THAT SUCKED!

570
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,750
THE SNOW'S FROZEN SOLID
LIKE A ROCK.

571
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,166
- SO YOU OKAY OR WHAT?

572
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:55,500
- HMM.

573
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,083
THIS IS FLIPPING ANNOYING.

574
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,958
WE STARTED SNOWBOARDING
AT THE SAME TIME,

575
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,291
AND HERE YOU ARE
MAKING IT LOOK LIKE

576
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:17,041
THE EASIEST THING
IN THE WORLD.

577
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,166
- ( chuckles )

578
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,875
- LOOK, I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

579
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,958
BUT OTHER CHICKS DON'T HAVE
YOUR ATHLETIC TALENT.

580
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,708
IT MAKES ME WANT TO VOMIT.

581
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:26,125
OF COURSE IT WAS
THE EXACT SAME STORY

582
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,291
WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED
LEARNING HOW TO DRIFT.

583
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,916
YOUR INTUITION IS KILLER,

584
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,166
AND YOU LEARN HOW TO
DEVELOP IT SO DAMN QUICKLY.

585
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:35,833
( laughs )
IT'S SHINGO!

586
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,333
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

587
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:40,208
- OH, HEY.
WHAT'S UP, SAYUKI?

588
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:42,250
- LONG TIME NO SEE, MAN.

589
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,166
IT'S CRAZY TO RUN INTO YOU
ALL THE WAY UP ON THIS MOUNTAIN.

590
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,166
I HAD NO IDEA THAT
YOU WERE INTO SNOWBOARDING.

591
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,000
- YEAH.  I DIG IT.

592
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,916
IT'S MY THING.
- THAT'S AWESOME.

593
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
AGAIN, I HAD NO IDEA.

594
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,250
- ( Shingo and Sayuki chuckle )

595
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,583
- Shingo: COME ON, I KNOW
HOW TO SNOWBOARD.

596
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,541
PRETTY FREAKING GOOD TOO.

597
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:01,750
- Sayuki: AND IN GRADE SCHOOL,
SHINGO ALWAYS HAD A STREAM OF 

598
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,166
SNOT POURING
FROM HIS NOSE.

599
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,541
IT WAS SICK!
- Shingo: SHUT UP.

600
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,166
- EVERYONE ALWAYS
MADE FUN OF HIM. 

601
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,666
CALLED HIM DROOPY-NOSE SHINGO.

602
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,333
THAT'S ABOUT THE TIME
HE BROKE BAD

603
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:12,791
AND TURNED INTO A SLICK BOY
REBEL RACER, RIGHT?

604
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,791
- DON'T GO MAKING
STUFF UP, SAYUKI.

605
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:17,708
COME ON. I JUST HAD A BUTTLOAD
OF ALLERGIES WHEN I WAS A KID.

606
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:19,000
YOU KNOW THAT.

607
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,625
- ( chuckles )

608
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,625
SO MAKO, WANT TO GET OUT THERE
AND HIT THE SLOPES A BIT MORE?

609
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,458
- UH...
- GO ON, I DON'T MIND.

610
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,875
I THINK I'M GONNA STAY HERE
AND CATCH UP WITH SHINGO A BIT.

611
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,458
TALK ABOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

612
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,208
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO UP
WITH HER, MIYAHARA?

613
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,166
IT'LL BE FUN.
- ( gasps )

614
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,375
- SURE.  I COULD GO
FOR ANOTHER RUN.

615
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,875
- YEAH.  I COULD
USE THE COMPANY.

616
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,583
- YOU GOT IT.

617
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:44,541
- ( people chattering )

618
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,625
- Shingo:
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM?

619
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,375
- HE KIND OF
LOOKS LIKE A WHIMP,

620
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:52,208
BUT FOR A FRIEND OF YOURS,
I GOTTA SAY, HE SEEMS NORMAL.

621
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,583
ANY IDEA HOW
HIS DRIVING IS?

622
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:57,166
- HE'S ONE OF THE FASTER
DRIVERS THE NIGHT KIDS HAVE.

623
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,916
BUT OF COURSE, NOT AS FAST
AS A COUPLE CHICKS I KNOW 

624
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,166
WHO DRIVE A RIDE
CALLED IMPACT BLUE.

625
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,333
- ( chuckles )

626
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:06,250
- ( sighs )

627
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,833
YOU KNOW,
SPEAKING OF FRIENDS,

628
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,250
YOURS IS TOO CUTE
NOT TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

629
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,250
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T
TRY TO HOOK YOUR BUDDY SHINGO

630
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,458
UP WITH HER INSTEAD.

631
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,125
- OH GIVE ME A BREAK, SHINGO.

632
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,500
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THAT
YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER.

633
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,333
BY THE WAY, IF YOU LET
THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG

634
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:20,833
AND TELL EITHER OF THEM
THAT THIS WAS

635
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:22,500
A BLIND DATE SETUP,
SHE'LL KILL ME

636
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,500
AND THEN I'LL KILL YOU,
GOT IT?

637
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,250
- I'LL KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT.

638
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,083
WHAT ABOUT YOU, SAYUKI?

639
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,958
YOU GOT A SPECIAL GUY
ON THE SIDE THESE DAYS?

640
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:32,000
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

641
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,833
- TAKESHI WAS
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

642
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:35,291
THE GUY'S DEVELOPED A CRUSH.

643
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,500
YOU INTERESTED IN SOME
NIGHT KID ACTION?

644
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,000
- UH...

645
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,458
- YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.

646
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,125
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN SNOWBOARDING?

647
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:03,458
- I JUST STARTED LAST YEAR.

648
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,125
- THAT'S REALLY AMAZING.

649
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,291
I DON'T KNOW MANY GIRLS
WHO CAN GO AS FAST AS YOU.

650
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,583
I MEAN, THIS KIND OF SNOW
IS MORE FOR THE SEASONED.

651
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:12,125
- WHAT CAN I SAY?
IT'S EXCITING FOR ME.

652
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,541
MORE SO THAN A LOT OF
OTHER STUFF.

653
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:15,291
WHEN I REALLY GET
INTO SOMETHING,

654
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:18,208
I TOTALLY FOCUS ON THAT THING
SO IT'S ALL I CAN SEE.

655
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:21,125
- HMM.

656
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,166
- SO TELL ME, MAKO,

657
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,416
YOU BEEN HAVING
ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT

658
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,041
SHINGO'S FOUR-EYED BUDDY?

659
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,583
- NO, NOT UNTIL
YOU BROUGHT HIM UP.

660
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,750
HE'S NICE.
JUST SEEMS KIND OF SERIOUS.

661
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,958
I GUESS THAT'S NOT 
A BAD THING THOUGH.

662
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,250
- IS THAT ALL?

663
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,166
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"IS THAT ALL?"

664
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,708
I JUST MET THE GUY. I DON'T
HAVE MUCH OF AN OPINION YET.

665
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:51,833
- Sayuki:
YEAH RIGHT.  I CAN TELL.

666
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:52,875
THEY'VE GOT SOME CHEMISTRY

667
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,750
BUBBLING BETWEEN
THE TWO OF THEM.

668
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,416
OH, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,
I HEARD SOMETHING INTERESTING

669
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,666
THE OTHER DAY.

670
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,625
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI
OF THE RED SUNS

671
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,291
IS RECRUITING RACERS.

672
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,708
HE'S GATHERING TOGETHER
A NEW TEAM,

673
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:05,208
AND I HEAR THAT HE MAY
EVEN BE PUTTING

674
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:07,208
AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX ON IT.

675
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,291
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOME KIND
OF SPECIAL TRAVELING TEAM

676
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,166
RUNNING AROUND
TO OTHER REGIONS.

677
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:15,333
- YOU'RE MESSING WITH ME.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

678
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:16,875
OF COURSE IT IS.

679
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,958
AND I REALLY ADMIRE
THE CONCEPT.

680
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,958
THE WHOLE IDEA OF
NEVER STAYING IN ONE PLACE

681
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,625
KEEPS THEM ALWAYS
MOVING FORWARD.

682
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,291
IT'S REALLY PROGRESSIVE
FOR DRIVERS.

683
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,958
- HMM.

684
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:27,625
- THEY'RE SO BADASS,
IT ALMOST MAKES ME

685
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,208
HATE THEM A LITTLE BIT.

686
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:32,250
THEY'VE GOT SOME
SERIOUS CHARISMA GOING ON.

687
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,791
( sighs )

688
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:36,208
I WISH I COULD SEE
TAKUMI AGAIN.

689
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:39,208
I WONDER IF HE'S BEEN DOING
WELL THESE PAST FEW WEEKS.

690
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:42,291
I BET YOU ANYTHING
HE'S LOOKING AS HOT AS EVER.

691
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:45,250
( chuckles ) THAT'S SOMETHING
I'M NEVER WRONG ABOUT.

692
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,541
- YEAH. YOU DO HAVE
GOOD TASTE IN MEN. 

693
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,250
- OH, GIRL.

694
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,833
I'M REALLY HOPING TO GET
MY RACE ON SOON.

695
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,416
YOU KNOW THE ROAD
ON THE WAY HERE

696
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,458
ACTUALLY LOOKED
KIND OF NICE.

697
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,833
I THINK IT WOULD BE
A TOTAL BLAST

698
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,416
TO GIVE IT A RUN SOMETIME.

699
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,541
I DIDN'T SEE ANY SNOW
DOWN TOWARD THE BOTTOM.

700
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:04,500
- ( chuckles ) YOU KNOW, I WAS
THINKING THE EXACT SAME THING.

701
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,500
YOU WANT TO GO CHECK IT OUT
WHEN WE'RE FINISHED?

702
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,416
- THAT SOUNDS KILLER.

703
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,333
WE'RE JUST SUCKERS
FOR RACING.

704
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:17,750
- Keisuke: I'M SO BORED.

705
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:21,291
THE PASS IS
TOO SNOWY TO RACE.

706
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,375
- YOU KNOW KEISUKE,
THOSE WHO CAN CONQUER

707
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,208
THE PASS IN WINTER CAN DO IT
EASIER IN THE SUMMER.

708
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:26,875
- HUH?

709
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:28,875
- OUR PROJECT ISN'T
GONNA GET GEARED UP GO

710
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,875
UNTIL THIS SPRING
AT ITS EARLIEST. 

711
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:33,208
WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT GONNA MAKE
ANY PROGRESS WHEN WE DO START 

712
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:36,291
IF WE SIT ON OUR HANDS
ALL WINTER LONG COMPLAINING.

713
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,500
GET OUT ON THAT SNOWY ROAD
AND START DRIVING.

714
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,291
- WHAT?

715
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:42,041
- CLEAR YOUR MIND
OF EVERYTHING,

716
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,625
AND GET YOUR ASS
ON THAT FROZEN ROAD

717
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,958
DAY AND NIGHT
AND EVERY SECOND IN BETWEEN.

718
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,458
YOU'LL SEE THE EFFECTS
OF YOUR HARD WORK

719
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,041
IN THE SPRING WHEN
THE SNOW THAWS

720
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,791
AND YOU CHANGE BACK
TO HIGH-GRIP TIRES.

721
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,458
IT'LL BE A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE.

722
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,625
YOUR SENSES WILL BE SHARPER
THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN,

723
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:59,875
AND YOUR DRIVING SKILLS
WILL BE DRAMATICALLY REFINED.

724
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,708
YOU'LL BE LIKE
A WHOLE NEW MAN.

725
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:04,083
LISTEN, KEISUKE.

726
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,750
WE'RE GONNA CREATE A NEW
UNBEATABLE RECORD AT EVERY PASS.

727
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,500
THAT'S HOW WE BUILD
OURSELVES AS LEGENDS.

728
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,500
ARE YOU COOL WITH THAT?

729
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,500
- SOUNDS GOOD.

730
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,500
- UNDERSTAND,
THE SNOW'S NOT A HANDICAP.

731
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:15,583
IT'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.

732
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:17,500
A TRAINING PARTNER LIKE
YOU'VE NOT HAD.

733
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,666
RACERS DON'T GET
AN OFF SEASON, BROTHER.

734
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:24,666
- ( tires squeal )

735
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,166
- THESE STUDLESS TIRES,
THEY DON'T GRIP VERY WELL.

736
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,500
- BUT STILL, THIS IS REALLY
GOOD TRAINING FOR YOU.

737
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:41,416
LOOK, YOU SEE A CORNER,
YOU ATTACK IT.

738
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
THAT'S THE VERY INSTINCT
OF A RACER.

739
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:48,791
- WHOA.  CRAZY.

740
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:50,541
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYBODY THAT FAST.

741
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,041
- AND THAT WAS
A SIL-EIGHTY. 

742
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,166
I MEAN, WHERE DID IT
EVEN COME FROM?

743
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:58,166
- MAN, THAT DRIVER'S
GOT SOME MAD SKILLS.

744
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,375
- HOW'S SHE HANDLING?

745
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:05,458
- THESE ARE ALL ONE PATTERN,
MID-SPEED CORNERS

746
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:06,666
WITH NO LIFE TO THEM.

747
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,166
IT'S FREAKING BORING.

748
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,583
I GUESS I'LL ALWAYS LIKE
USUI PASS THE BEST.

749
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,375
- ( cellphone ringing )

750
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:20,958
- Sayuki:
HELLO? OH HEY, SHINGO.

751
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,208
WHAT'S GOING ON?

752
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:23,791
WHAT?

753
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,291
THOSE TWO HAVE BEEN
SEEING EACH OTHER? 

754
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,250
SHE NEVER BOTHERED
TO TELL ME ABOUT IT.

755
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,833
- THEY ARE.  AND HE'S ALL
JAZZED UP ABOUT IT.

756
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:31,750
IN FACT, I THINK
THEY HAVE A DATE TODAY.

757
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,583
- NO KIDDING.
GREAT FOR THEM.

758
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,416
WELL, I HOPE THEY HAVE FUN.

759
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,000
YEAH?

760
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,416
YEAH, THAT'S NICE.

761
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,583
WELL, CHRISTMAS IS
COMING UP PRETTY SOON.

762
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,958
YEAH.
TALK TO YOU LATER.

763
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,000
- ( phone beeps )

764
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,916
- I WONDER IF ALL THOSE
YEARS WITHOUT A BOYFRIEND

765
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,291
ARE FINALLY GONNA COME
TO AN END FOR MAKO?

766
00:41:56,666 --> 00:42:00,083
- I THINK THIS SW-20
IS A REALLY SWEET RIDE.

767
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,833
- A TWO-SEATER'S FUN,

768
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,333
BUT IT CAN KIND OF
CRAMP YOUR STYLE, 

769
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:04,791
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

770
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:07,000
I THINK NEXT TIME,
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BUY

771
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:09,375
SOMETHING A WHOLE LOT MORE
PRACTICAL THAN THIS FOR SURE.

772
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:12,541
A FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE SUV
MIGHT BE NICE.

773
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,750
- WHY?  THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE QUITTING RACING, DOES IT?

774
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,708
- I THINK SO, YEAH.

775
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:26,875
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE 
ANY EXCUSES ABOUT IT,

776
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:29,958
BUT I THINK I'VE ALREADY
HAD MY FUN WITH RACING. 

777
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:32,041
WHEN YOU'RE A BEGINNER,
YOU TRY YOUR HARDEST,

778
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,791
YOU GIVE IT YOUR ALL.

779
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:35,791
AND IT'S EXCITING 
TO GO FROM NOTHING

780
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:38,708
TO A GUY THAT 
PEOPLE ADMIRE.

781
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:40,291
BUT ONCE YOU REACH
A CERTAIN LEVEL,

782
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,958
AND YOU KIND OF 
SEE YOUR LIMITS,

783
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:43,625
YOU STOP SETTING
GOALS FOR YOURSELF.

784
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,208
YOUR EAGERNESS SUBSIDES.

785
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:47,791
IT'S JUST NOT
WHAT IT USED TO BE.

786
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,625
- I GUESS THAT'S THE WAY
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO GROW

787
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:52,166
OUT OF IT SOONER OR LATER.

788
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,041
THAT'S HOW I DID.

789
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:55,541
- I DON'T KNOW.

790
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,208
I'M NOT SURE THAT
EVERYBODY'S GOALS

791
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,583
CAN JUST UP AND VANISH
FROM THEIR LIVES THAT EASILY.

792
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:01,041
- HUH?

793
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,916
- AWHILE BACK,
THERE WAS THIS TIME

794
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,583
WHEN I THOUGHT
AFTER THIS SUMMER

795
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,250
I WAS GONNA
QUIT RACING TOO.

796
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,666
BUT THEN I HAD
AN OPPORTUNITY

797
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,666
TO WATCH THIS REALLY
HIGH LEVEL RACER

798
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,666
AT THIS INTENSE COMPETITION.

799
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,666
AFTER THAT I REALIZED HOW MUCH
MORE THERE IS TO THE CRAFT.

800
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,666
- ( chuckles )

801
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,666
I DON'T THINK I TAKE RACING
AS SERIOUSLY AS YOU DO.

802
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,625
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING TO BE
A PRO OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

803
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,375
- (  Mako gasps )

804
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:39,291
- ( chuckles )

805
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:44,125
- Miyahara: I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT'S A POSSIBILITY,

806
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:48,291
BUT I THINK IT'D BE COOL IF YOU
QUIT RACING ALONG WITH ME.

807
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,625
- RACING A PASS IS ONE OF

808
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,708
THE MOST DANGEROUS
THINGS IN THE WORLD.

809
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:54,541
I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO DO
WITH YOU BEING A GIRL.

810
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:56,291
IT'S JUST, I DON'T
WANT TO HAVE TO WORRY

811
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:58,291
ABOUT YOU GETTING
INTO AN ACCIDENT.

812
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:00,875
I KNOW, NO ONE CAN
TAKE AWAY YOUR RIGHT

813
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,125
TO DO WHATEVER 
YOU WANT TO DO.

814
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,250
THAT'S YOURS, OF COURSE.

815
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,791
BUT IF I WAS YOUR BOYFRIEND,

816
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,666
I WOULDN'T BE TOO CRAZY
ABOUT YOU KEEPING ON.

817
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:14,750
IT'D WORRY ME SO MUCH
TO LET YOU RUN OFF EVERY NIGHT

818
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:17,666
TO RACE SOME STRANGER WHO'S
GOT ONLY VICTORY IN HIS SIGHTS,

819
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,791
AND NO CARE AS TO
HOW HE GETS IT.

820
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:22,708
THERE'S SO MANY OTHER
FUN THINGS TO DO IN LIFE.

821
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,791
THINGS YOU COULD BE
DOING WITH ME.

822
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,750
I THINK IT MIGHT
SUIT YOU BETTER 

823
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,416
TO PUT ON A FANCY DRESS AND
LET ME TAKE YOU OUT TO EAT.

824
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,916
YOU'RE TOO PRETTY
TO LET IT WASTE

825
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,708
BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR.
- ( gasps )

826
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:50,166
- I'M SERIOUS ABOUT EVERYTHING
I SAID TO YOU, MAKO.

827
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,958
I'VE NEVER FELT
THIS WAY ABOUT ANYONE.

828
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:52,916
YOU'RE THE FIRST.

829
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:57,958
WILL YOU DO ME THE HONOR
OF BEING WITH ME?

830
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:24,541
- I...

831
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:28,125
I'M HONESTLY FLATTERED 
THAT YOU FEEL THIS WAY.

832
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:30,208
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW I FEEL YET.

833
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:34,791
I MEAN, WE-- WE JUST MET.

834
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:37,000
WE HARDLY KNOW EACH OTHER.

835
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:38,416
AND ALL OF THIS,

836
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,750
IT JUST FEELS
KIND OF SUDDEN TO ME.

837
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:44,833
- THAT'S OKAY, MAKO.

838
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:47,250
I'M NOT ASKING FOR
AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW.

839
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,750
HOW ABOUT YOU LET ME
TAKE YOU OUT AGAIN

840
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,166
IN A WEEK OR SO.

841
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,833
SAY MAYBE ON CHRISTMAS EVE?

842
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,500
UNTIL THEN,
JUST GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT.

843
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,458
NO RUSH.

844
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:09,000
- ( humming "Jingle Bells" )

845
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:10,708
AAH!

846
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:12,333
- YOU'RE IN A GOOD
STINKIN' MOOD, DUMMY.

847
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:13,791
YOU GOT SOME BIG
PLANS FOR CHRISTMAS

848
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:14,958
YOU AIN'T TELLING US ABOUT?

849
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,666
- I DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS.
I SWEAR I DON'T.

850
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,375
- YOU DOING ANYTHING,
IKETANI?

851
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:21,625
- OF COURSE NOT.
SPENDING ANOTHER NIGHT ALONE

852
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,375
'CAUSE WE'RE THE LONELY DRIVERS.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, ITSUKI?

853
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:26,291
- COURSE IT'S SAD.
LET ME GO.

854
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:30,083
- Yuuichi: WHAT A PATHETIC
BUNCH OF LOSERS.

855
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:42,125
- WHAT'S WITH
THE SERIOUS FACE, GIRL?

856
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,291
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING'S
CHIPPING AWAY AT YOUR MIND.

857
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:47,041
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

858
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,916
NOT EVEN TO YOU,
SORRY.

859
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,541
- THAT'S A BAD HABIT YOU GOT.

860
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,708
KEEPING EVERYTHING THAT
BOTHERS YOU TO YOURSELF

861
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:54,875
ALL THE TIME?
IT'LL TEAR YOU UP.

862
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:56,708
- I JUST HAVE
A LOT ON MY MIND.

863
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,541
I WOULDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHERE TO START.

864
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:02,000
MOSTLY I KEEP WONDERING WHY I
EVEN BOTHER WITH RACING ANYMORE.

865
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:03,500
- HMM?

866
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:05,166
- STOP STARING AT ME.

867
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,166
I KNOW THAT YOU AND I
USUALLY TRY TO AVOID 

868
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,083
THIS KIND OF SERIOUS TALK.

869
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:10,833
- I WANT TO BE
A BETTER RACER, I DO.

870
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:13,333
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
THAT'S ALL THAT DRIVES ME.

871
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:16,625
THAT PROBABLY SOUNDS PRETTY
STRANGE TO YOU, DOESN'T IT?

872
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,041
- NO, I DON'T THINK
IT SEEMS STRANGE AT ALL.

873
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:23,000
HANG ON, DID SOMEBODY SAY
SOMETHING TO YOU? WHO WAS IT?

874
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:26,083
HELL, I MEAN MAYBE YOU'RE
JUST TOO INNOCENT A GIRL.

875
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,041
TOO EASILY INFLUENCED
BY OTHERS, YOU KNOW? 

876
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,333
THE TWO OF US,
I MEAN, WE ARE WHO WE ARE

877
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:35,208
NO MATTER WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE SAY.

878
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:37,750
- ( gasps )

879
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,166
( sighs )

880
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,541
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

881
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:10,750
- ( car door opens )

882
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:20,625
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

883
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:22,833
- EVERYTHING'S FINE.

884
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:25,000
BUT I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO
HAVE YOU COME OUT HERE

885
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:27,041
ON CHRISTMAS EVE
OF ALL NIGHTS.

886
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:31,333
- IT'S ALL GOOD.
REALLY JUST HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

887
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:32,916
- I WANT YOU
TO DO SOMETHING.

888
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,916
- WAIT.
I'M NOT RACING YOU.

889
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,250
YOU'D HAVE TO BE CRAZY TO THINK
I'D EVEN CONSIDER DOING THAT.

890
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,000
- WHICH IS WHY 
I'M NOT ASKING.

891
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,583
I WANT YOU TO RIDE
NEXT TO ME

892
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:42,875
WHEN I GO ON A RUN.

893
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:43,958
- UH?

894
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,416
- ( engine revs )

895
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,000
- Mako: USUALLY IT'S SAYUKI
SITTING IN THE SEAT NEXT TO ME.

896
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,958
THIS FEELS WAY DIFFERENT.
LIKE I'M CHEATING.

897
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,958
RIGHT.
HOLD ONTO YOUR BOOTS.

898
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,125
- ( gasps )

899
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:37,041
- Miyahara:
DAMN, SHE'S GOOD.

900
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:39,833
I HAD NO IDEA SHE COULD
ROCK IT LIKE THIS.

901
00:49:57,583 --> 00:50:00,083
YOU'RE WAY BETTER THAN
I THOUGHT YOU WERE, MAKO.

902
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:02,666
WE ONLY HAVE A HANDFUL OF NIGHT
KIDS WHO CAN DRIVE LIKE THAT,

903
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,583
AND YOU'D EVEN GIVE THEM
A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.

904
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,833
WHO KNOWS, YOU MIGHT EVEN
BE BETTER THAN TAKESHI

905
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,416
AND SHINGO PUT TOGETHER.

906
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,250
( sighs )

907
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:12,833
DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG
TO FIGURE OUT

908
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:14,250
WHY YOU HAD ME
RIDE WITH YOU TONIGHT.

909
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,916
THAT WAS A SMART MOVE.

910
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,250
I'M GUESSING THIS WOULD BE 
YOUR ANSWER TO MY QUESTION.

911
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:22,750
- YEAH, I'M SORRY.

912
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:23,916
BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT
IT PROBABLY MORE

913
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,500
THAN I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT ANYTHING.

914
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:28,625
AT THE END OF THIS,
YOU MIGHT THINK

915
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:30,541
I'M JUST SOME DUMB GIRL,

916
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,541
BUT I CAN'T SHAKE
HOW BADLY I WANT TO RACE.

917
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:33,958
IT'S PART OF WHO I AM.

918
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:40,708
I'M A SIMPLE PERSON.

919
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,708
I WANT TO KEEP CHASING
AFTER THE OTHER CARS

920
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:46,125
IN FRONT OF ME THAT ARE
TRYING TO GET AWAY.

921
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:48,125
AND I WANT TO DO IT,
EVEN IF I CAN'T--

922
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:50,125
EVEN IF I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH THEM, I DON'T CARE.

923
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:52,083
I JUST WANT TO
KEEP MOVING.

924
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:54,958
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

925
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,791
HOW YOU TREATED ME
SINCE WE'VE MET

926
00:50:56,875 --> 00:51:00,541
HAS MADE ME FEEL
SO SPECIAL.

927
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:01,708
- I UNDERSTAND.

928
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,708
- BYE.

929
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:11,583
- ( car door opens, closes )

930
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:12,958
- ( engine starts )

931
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:24,000
- Miyahara:
I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE,

932
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:27,583
BUT THE PEOPLE IN HER LIFE
THAT SHE CARES SO MUCH ABOUT

933
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:29,583
DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD
THEY GOT IT.

934
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:32,541
AND I COULDN'T BE
MORE JEALOUS OF THEM.

935
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,125
- ( pop music playing )

936
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,166
- WHY IS IT JUST
THE THREE OF US SITTING HERE?

937
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,625
WHERE THE HELL IS TAKUMI?

938
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:42,208
- MAYBE HE'S GOT
A BIG DATE TONIGHT.

939
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:44,291
YOU NEVER KNOW.
- WHO CARES, GUYS?

940
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:46,166
LET HIM HAVE HIS FUN.

941
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,500
WHY DON'T WE JUST FOCUS
ON THE THREE OF US

942
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:51,208
HAVING A BLAST!
YEAH!  SWEET.

943
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:52,583
( laughing )

944
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,416
- ( both sigh )
- MERRY CHRISTMAS!

945
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:04,125
- ( theme song playing )

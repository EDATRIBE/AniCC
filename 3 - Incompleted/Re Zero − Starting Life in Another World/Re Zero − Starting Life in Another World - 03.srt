1
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,291
[GIRL]
I'm glad you're here.

2
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,375
You won't get away this time.

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,333
[SUBARU]
What? Why is she here?

4
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:21,291
It's still light out.

5
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,375
Wait, is this how early
she would've arrived

6
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,959
if she hadn't been with me?

7
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,291
What is wrong with you?
Don't you know when to quit?

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,709
I'm telling you,
let it go already!

9
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:32,500
I'm sorry, but this is something
I simply cannot give up on.

10
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,583
If you do as I say and
cooperate, I won't hurt you.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,500
I have but one request to make
of you: Return what is mine.

12
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,250
My insignia's very
important to me...

13
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:56,875
Whoa.

14
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,875
If she were just another
run-of-the-mill magic user,

15
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,458
I wouldn't back down,
but this one's trouble.

16
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:02,875
What's your problem?

17
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,500
You're admitting defeat
before we even start fighting?

18
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:09,333
Young lady, so, uh,
you're an elf, right?

19
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:17,166
Not exactly.

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,667
Technically speaking,
I'm only a half-elf.

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,166
Wait, seriously?

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,333
Your hair. It's silver!
Are you the--?!

23
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,667
It's an accidental resemblance!

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,250
And to be honest, it causes
me a lot of trouble.

25
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,834
I should've known better.
You set me up, didn't you?

26
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:33,041
[SUBARU]
Huh? No, I didn't do anything.

27
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,625
All that "I'm gonna return
it to its owner" crap?

28
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,458
That just made you
more suspicious!

29
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:38,834
What do you mean?

30
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:41,542
Are you saying that you two
aren't working together?

31
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,208
[gasps]

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,500
[SUBARU]
Her nature never changes,

33
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,667
no matter how many times
I start over in this world.

34
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,959
[FELT] Hey, jerk! What
are you smirking about?!

35
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,667
Come on, hasn't
this been enough?

36
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,583
Give her insignia back already.

37
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:06,250
And you, Sat-- Hurry up
and get out of here.

38
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,709
And try not to let anyone
steal it again, okay?

39
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:11,083
Why are you being so nice
to me all of a sudden?

40
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,583
Honestly, nothing you're doing
is making any sense at all.

41
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,166
[FELT]
I don't understand you, either!

42
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,166
What's goin' on? Did you hit
your head or somethin'?

43
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,083
Puck, quick! Shield her!

44
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,542
That was fast thinking.

45
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,709
Cutting it a bit closer
than I expected.

46
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:29,834
You saved us!

47
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:30,875
Nice one, Puck!

48
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,291
Thank goodness it
was before five,

49
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,959
while you're still on duty!

50
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,875
Thanks, you're the best!

51
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,250
[ELSA] Well, well.
That's a spirit, isn't it?

52
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,333
[ELSA laughs]

53
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:41,750
[ELSA]
How wonderful.

54
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,709
I've never had the
pleasure of cutting open

55
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:46,125
a spirit's stomach before.

56
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,625
Hey, now what do
you mean by that?

57
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,417
We can't really
enter negotiations

58
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,250
if the item's original
owner is here now, can we?

59
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,792
And because of that,
I've changed my plans.

60
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,291
I'm going to slaughter
every last one of you.

61
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,917
You failed to see your job
all the way through to the end.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,375
You certainly talk a good game,

63
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,667
but honestly,
you do terrible work.

64
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,208
I was hoping you were more
than just another slum dweller.

65
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,166
[SUBARU]
You bitch...

66
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,375
Cut the crap!

67
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,792
What kind of sicko
gets their kicks

68
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,250
from picking on
a little kid, huh?

69
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,875
You should be ashamed, you
gut-slicing, sadistic woman!

70
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,667
Felt is doing her best to stand
her ground and live strong!

71
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,166
'Cause your plan
didn't go your way,

72
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,291
you think you can throw a
tantrum and flip tables?

73
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,208
Grow up, you pathetic
spoiled brat!

74
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,291
You should try to learn to
value life a little more!

75
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,041
'Cause having your
belly cut hurts!

76
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,250
[ELSA] Now what are
you babbling about?

77
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,583
[SUBARU] I'm in the process of
letting the justice and chivalry

78
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,583
I never knew I had denounce
all the unfairness in the world!

79
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,792
And, what I consider "unfair"
is you, this situation, and...

80
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,709
Okay, folks,
ready for the fun part?

81
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:47,750
There! That should
buy us enough time.

82
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,333
All right! Get her, Puck!

83
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,250
I hope your brilliant
display of awkwardness

84
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,667
lives through the ages.

85
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,709
Here we go! My turn!

86
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,583
We haven't had the chance to
introduce ourselves, have we?

87
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,083
My name's Puck.

88
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,625
Now do your best to remember
it on the way to your grave!

89
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:07,959
Did we get her, or what?!

90
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,291
Don't say things like
that, you'll jinx it!

91
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,834
[ELSA]
One should always be prepared.

92
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,333
Don't underestimate
a user of spirit arts!

93
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,875
You're well accustomed
to battle, for a girl.

94
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,125
[ELSA]
"A girl", huh?

95
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,917
My, it's been a while
since I've been regarded

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,333
in such simple terms.

97
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:37,917
[PUCK]
Well, from my perspective,

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,333
all opponents are
little more than babies.

99
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:43,291
Still, you're so strong,
I almost pity you.

100
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,250
I'm deeply touched to be
praised by a spirit.

101
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,667
If this thing turns into
a battle of attrition,

102
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,959
I'd say we stand
a pretty good chance.

103
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,500
Well, for a spirit,

104
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,709
the real battle is how long
they can stay in their bodies.

105
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:59,750
That's right,
it must be almost five.

106
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,208
And when we were both
having so much fun, too.

107
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,291
What a bore.

108
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,208
Just one of the
drawbacks of the job.

109
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,417
When you're a ladies' man,

110
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,458
the girls won't give you
the chance to sleep.

111
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,875
But you know, staying up
late is bad for your skin,

112
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,583
so I'd say it's about
time we wrap this up.

113
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,125
[ELSA]
Huh?

114
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,709
[PUCK] Didn't think I was
just throwing those around

115
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,041
at random, did you?

116
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,041
Looks like I've
been had. Oh, my.

117
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,083
[PUCK]
Say goodnight!

118
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,500
[ELSA]
My, how lovely!

119
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,709
I thought I was going to die.

120
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:43,875
[ALL gasp]

121
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,291
But you are a tricky girl,

122
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,792
so I don't find that sort
of thing very impressive.

123
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,583
Puck, can you keep going?

124
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:52,291
Sorry... but I'm sleepy.

125
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,208
Think I underestimated her.

126
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,166
My mana's gone, so I'm done.

127
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,375
Don't worry, I'll take care of
things out here so you can rest.

128
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,083
Thank you for your help.

129
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,750
Remember: If anything
happens to you,

130
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,875
I'll act according
to my contract.

131
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,625
If it comes down to it, call me,

132
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,333
even if you have to
squeeze me out of my od.

133
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,667
[ELSA]
Aww, you're going away?

134
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,166
[ELSA] Well, that's
terribly unfortunate.

135
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,166
I know this is pretty
interesting, Felt,

136
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,000
but we can't afford to just
sit around watching anymore.

137
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,583
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

138
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:43,834
If we're gonna
make a run for it,

139
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,208
we need to get moving right now.

140
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,041
Oh, and about before...

141
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,291
Well, I guess you
kinda saved me.

142
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,166
But only just a
little bit, okay?

143
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,500
Also, don't call
me a little kid!

144
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,834
I am 15 years old, you know!

145
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,959
That can't be much
younger than you, jerk.

146
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,041
Well, actually, I'll be
turning 18 this year.

147
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,417
Huh?! No way! Really?!

148
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,333
'Cause you don't even look like
you're old enough to shave yet!

Here I come!

Oh, how rude! Don't cut in
on someone else's dance!

151
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,375
If you wanna dance,

152
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll show you the best
dancing you've ever seen!

[ROM gasps]

156
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,625
You're so strong, I was
able to stand on your club.

157
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:47,250
Now...

158
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,750
Not gonna happen!

You bad girl...

You've neither the resolve
nor the strength to fight.

162
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,041
You'd have been better off
using your small stature

163
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,125
to hide away in the corner.

164
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,250
[SUBARU] Damn, we're finished!
There's really nothing I can do.

165
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,208
I'll have to use Return
by Death and start over...

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,834
[SUBARU] No... I don't
wanna feel that pain again.

[SUBARU] Hey, are you
gonna be all right?!

172
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,166
Why'd you risk your life for...?

173
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,250
Never mind, just listen
to me carefully, Felt.

174
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,792
I'm gonna buy us some time,

175
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,041
find a way to give you an
opening somehow, and when I do,

176
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,125
I want you to run
as fast as you can!

177
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,500
Not a chance!

178
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,291
I'm s'posed to tuck my tail
between my legs and run?

179
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,625
Yeah, that's right!

180
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,333
Stick out your butt,
tuck in your tail, and run!

181
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:06,166
You're 15, and I'm 18.

182
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,917
And that means that you're
probably the youngest one

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,458
out of everybody here.

184
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,250
So it's a given that we're gonna
pick the method most likely

185
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,000
to keep you alive and
get you outta this place.

186
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:13,875
You understand?!

187
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,083
Ah, give me a break!

188
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,333
You were cowering in
fear just a minute ago!

189
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,709
[SUBARU] Well, that was
then. And this is now.

190
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,458
Don't worry about me.
Everything's fine.

191
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,542
[SUBARU]
Take this!

192
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,250
This is it! Now! Run!

193
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,959
You think I'll let her go?

194
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,625
[SUBARU]
Whoa, I'm awesome!

195
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,291
But that hurt the tips of my
toes more than I expected.

196
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,959
It looks like you
let one get away.

197
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,291
[ELSA] For once, I'm
feeling a tiny bit annoyed.

198
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,917
[GIRL]
Hey! Don't forget about me!

199
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,500
I hope you have
some other attacks

200
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,500
because I've grown
tired of that one.

201
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,667
Do you think you can
still keep me amused?

202
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,208
If you've got some
ultimate power

203
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,875
hidden somewhere in
your bag of tricks,

204
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,458
I'm thinkin' now
might be a good time.

205
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,000
[GIRL]
Well, I do have a trump card.

206
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,709
But if I use it, I'll be the
only one who's left standing.

207
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,125
Whoa, easy!

208
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,375
Now don't do anything that'll
blow us both up, okay?

209
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,458
I have no intention of using
it while you're still here,

210
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,750
doing your best...

211
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,834
...fighting alongside me...

212
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:46,208
[SUBARU]
I didn't see anything just now.

213
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,709
[GIRL]
Huh?

214
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:49,583
[SUBARU] None of that whole
conversation ever happened!

215
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:53,583
I finally remembered why
I'm here in the first place!

216
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,959
I'll kill you, you shitbag!

217
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,709
Then you won't have
to play your trump card!

218
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,208
I'll blow you away and get...

219
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:05,792
...a happy ending!

220
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,917
Energetic, huh? Too bad.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,333
You black widow!

222
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,125
[ELSA] Well, there's no doubt
you'll be the first one

223
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,875
caught in my web.

224
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,083
[SUBARU]
Nice cover!

225
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,041
Dammit!

226
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,750
How do you like this?!

227
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,542
I've got you now.

228
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,500
[REINHARD]
That's enough.

229
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,542
[REINHARD] Looks like
I cut it pretty close,

230
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,125
but I'm glad I made it in time.

231
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,458
Now...

232
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,166
I know you.

233
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:03,375
What do you say? Shall we
put an end to this?

234
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,542
[FELT]
Someone!

235
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:12,250
Anyone! Isn't there
anybody who can hear me?!

236
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,041
Damn it! Please!

237
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:20,542
Please! Someone--! Someone help!
She's-She's gonna kill him!

238
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:27,750
[REINHARD]
Very well.

239
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,375
[REINHARD]
I'll help you.

240
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,125
Reinhart? But how?

241
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,834
[REINHARD]
Hello there, Subaru.

242
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:44,375
Seems we meet again.
Sorry I'm late.

243
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,041
Black hair, black clothes,

244
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,959
and a blade unique to
the northern provinces.

245
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,959
There's no mistaking
those characteristics.

246
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,959
You are the Bowel Hunter.

247
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,208
[SUBARU] Seriously? What kind
of evil nickname is that?!

248
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,041
It was derived from
her unique style

249
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,875
of killing those who oppose her.

250
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,500
Her name is known far and
wide as a menace to society.

251
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,667
Ah, Reinhart.

252
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,083
Yes, a true knight
among knights,

253
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,041
born to the Master
Swordsman's line.

254
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,083
It's quite remarkable that each
my opponents are so much fun!

255
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,458
[REINHARD] There are many
things I'd like to ask you.

256
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,083
I suggest you surrender.

257
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,458
Now do you honestly expect
a starving predator like myself

258
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:25,500
to resist the temptation
of such delectable prey?

259
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,750
Subaru, please,
move back a little bit.

260
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,291
If you'd stand next to her,
I'd appreciate it.

261
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,834
Whatever you say.

262
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,959
That woman is a monster, so
don't let your guard down, okay?

263
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,792
As luck would have it,

264
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:40,583
hunting monsters happens
to be a specialty of mine.

265
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,166
[ROM groans]

266
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,250
[SUBARU]
Old Man Rom is still alive?

267
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,834
He's not out of the woods yet.

268
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,750
I'm gonna have to heal him now.

269
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,166
Are you sure?

270
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,792
I mean, he's part of the gang
that stole your insignia

271
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,208
and caused this mess.

272
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,041
That's exactly
why I'm doing this.

273
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,917
If he recovers,
he can repay the favor

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,583
by giving me information.

275
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:03,208
He wouldn't lie to me then.
Not after saving his life.

276
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,375
See? This is for
my own sake, too.

277
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,125
I would rather not resort
to using violence on a woman.

278
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,458
[ELSA]
Look at you! My!

279
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:21,333
You're just as good as the
rumors say. Maybe better.

280
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:23,667
I hope that I can meet
your expectations.

281
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,125
[ELSA] Aren't you going to
use that sword at your hip?

282
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,667
Love the chance to experience

283
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,166
its legendary
sharpness first-hand.

284
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,041
[REINHARD] This sword
can only be drawn at times

285
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,583
when it's truly needed.

286
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,709
The fact that it hasn't
left its sheath as of yet

287
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,291
means that this is not
one of those times.

288
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,250
I believe you underestimate me.

289
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,041
[REINHARD] Truthfully,
it's an upsetting judgment

290
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,125
for me, as well.

291
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:48,041
Therefore... I will take
you on with this instead.

292
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,250
Any objections?

293
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,333
Of course not. It's
wonderful. Wonderful!

294
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,542
Do entertain me, please!

295
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,709
If you've lost your weapon,
then I suggest you surrender.

296
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:07,917
[SUBARU]
Watch out, Reinhart!

297
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,750
She's got a second one!

298
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,750
I'm impressed you knew.

299
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:16,166
I've experienced your
blades personally.

300
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,125
But I have more than two
fangs, I'll have you know.

301
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,875
You wouldn't mind if we
started again, would you?

302
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,959
[REINHARD] If I deprive
you of all your weapons,

303
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,333
will you be satisfied?

304
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,792
If I lose my fangs,
I'll use my claws.

305
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,333
If I lose my claws,
I'll use my bones.

306
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,542
And if I lose my bones,
I'll use my life.

307
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,125
That's how a Bowel
Hunter fights.

308
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,917
[SUBARU] There's no way
Reinhart's gonna fail

309
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,875
to land the decisive
blow, right?

310
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,375
Unfortunately, he's not able
to fight at his full strength

311
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,208
'cause I'm using my spirit arts.

312
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,083
What do those have to
do with each other?

313
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,333
If Reinhard were truly
intent on fighting,

314
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:53,125
all the mana in the atmosphere
would turn away from me.

315
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,291
I've almost finished
healing him, though.

316
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,250
So be sure he knows
when I give you the signal.

317
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,000
He should be all
right now. Go ahead.

318
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,166
Hey, Reinhart!

319
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,709
I don't really get it,
but do your thing!

320
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:12,500
[ELSA]
What are you going to show me?

321
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,542
[REINHARD] The swordplay
of the Astrea family.

322
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,625
You're facing the Bowel Hunter,
Miss Elsa Granhiert.

323
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,500
Master Swordsman's line.

324
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,959
I'm Reinhart van Astrea!

325
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,375
[SUBARU yells]

326
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,083
[SUBARU] "Hunting monsters
is your specialty," my ass!

327
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,083
Look at this place! You're a
monster yourself, you freak!

328
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:17,500
Even I'm a bit hurt by a cruel
comment like that, Subaru.

329
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,750
I'm sorry I asked
too much of you.

330
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,709
Rest well now.

331
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,375
[SUBARU] There's not a shadow
of her left, let alone a body.

332
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,166
He did all that with just
one swing of a sword?

333
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,375
Is it all over now?

334
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,834
[SUBARU]
Looks like it.

335
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,792
Figuratively and literally.

336
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,542
Why are you staring at me?

337
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,667
That is quite rude,
you should know better.

338
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,125
Oh, it's just...

339
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,166
You still have your arms and
legs, and even your head.

340
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,792
Of course I do.

341
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,542
Don't say such things.

342
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,333
[SUBARU] Yeah, you're right.
Pretty obvious, huh?

343
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,208
I still have my arms, too.

344
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,875
And there's no knife in my back.

345
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:53,125
No gaping hole in
my gut, either! Whew!

346
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,709
What strange things
to point out.

347
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,959
You talk as if you've
experienced them before.

348
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,667
Actually, there was
a time when I did.

349
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,250
Oh, yeah, and Reinhart!
I haven't thanked you yet.

350
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,667
You saved my ass!

351
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,500
You saved it back
in the alley, too.

352
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,792
Guess you just have
a way of knowing

353
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,458
when I could really
use some help.

354
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:11,792
If I had the ability to do that,
I'd certainly be proud.

355
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,166
This friend of yours,

356
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,917
I found her running
around the streets,

357
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,500
quite frightened and desperate.

358
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,458
And she asked for my help.
So I came here.

359
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:20,917
It's her...

360
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,500
Now, hang on a second.

361
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,959
If she hadn't brought
Reinhart here,

362
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,500
who knows if we'd even be
having this conversation.

363
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,041
Just take a look at this face,

364
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,542
and spare me the "ice statue"
punishment, okay?

365
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,500
I wouldn't do
anything that violent.

366
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,083
And what does your face
have to do with any--?

367
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,041
Subaru!

368
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,000
[SUBARU]
Huh?

369
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,458
[SUBARU]
She'll go for the gut!

370
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,166
Get away!

371
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,000
That boy got in my way again.

372
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,542
[REINHARD]
That's enough, Elsa!

373
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,542
Before long,

374
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:04,000
I will disembowel every last
one of you here in this room.

375
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:08,125
Until that moment comes,
be sure to take of yourselves.

376
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,458
Are you all right?

377
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:11,750
My being "all right"

378
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:14,250
isn't what's most important
right now, but...

379
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,625
Are you all right?
That was far too reckless!

380
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:20,125
Oh, it was no problem.

381
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,458
Now, it sure took a
long time to get here,

382
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:25,542
but the good news is,
I finally made it.

383
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,458
My name is Subaru Natsuki!

384
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,542
And I just risked it
all to save your life

385
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,667
from a dangerous
and heinous villain!

386
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,166
Is that okay?

387
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,542
"Okay"...?

388
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,166
[SUBARU] It means,
"Are we clear on that?"

389
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,208
So okay?

390
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,125
O-Okay...

391
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,417
I, your rescuer, am the
one who saved your life.

392
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,083
And you are the heroine I
saved from the clutches of evil!

393
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,375
So wouldn't that mean you
should repay me in kind?

394
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,458
Wouldn't it? Huh?!

395
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes, I understand!

396
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,959
But only if whatever
you want reward-wise

397
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,583
is within my power, of course...

398
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:55,792
[SUBARU]
That sounds fair to me!

399
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,709
In that case, I have
only one request!

400
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:02,291
And... that request is...

401
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,583
...I want you to tell
me what your name is.

402
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,959
[GIRL giggles]

403
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:12,959
Emilia.

404
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,208
[SUBARU]
Huh?

405
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,458
My name is Emilia. Only Emilia.

406
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:21,917
Your price was easy to pay.

407
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,750
Thanks so much for
saving me, Subaru.

408
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,083
[SUBARU]
All those times I got hurt,

409
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,917
all the crying I did,
all the pain I felt,

410
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,083
all the fighting with
my life on the line...

411
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:40,208
And my reward was her
name and a single smile.

412
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:45,250
[sighs] Oh, man... Talk about
unequal compensation.

413
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:49,917
Anyway, Subaru,

414
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,792
I'm impressed that you're
still able to stand.

415
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,166
[SUBARU]
I was lucky this thing was there

416
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,583
to grab for protection.

417
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:57,291
Otherwise, I'd be in
two pieces right now.

418
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,208
[REINHARD]
True. If not for this...

419
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,625
What the--?

420
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,166
[SUBARU] Uh-oh. I should've
seen this coming.

421
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,208
[EMILIA]
Subaru?

422
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,750
Subaru!

423
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,875
[SUBARU]
Man...

424
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:21,250
She's so cute when she's
panicking like that.

425
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,375
A fantasy in another world...

426
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,375
[EMILIA] There. His
treatment is complete.

427
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,333
He should be over the hump now.

428
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,917
[REINHARD]
By the way, Miss Emilia,

429
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,083
what's the nature of
your relation to Subaru?

430
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,709
An acquaintance?

431
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,417
Honestly, I don't recall
ever seeing him before.

432
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,750
When we met earlier today,

433
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,041
I believe it was
the very first time.

434
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,333
But he was looking for you.

435
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:50,000
Said he had something
to give you.

436
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,083
Odd behavior from a stranger.

437
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,333
Yes, it is rather peculiar...

438
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,625
So what do you propose
we do with him, then?

439
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:58,709
I'd be glad to take him
to my home as a guest,

440
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:01,291
at least while he's healing.

441
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,959
I'll take him home with me.

442
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,041
That way, I can find out
what's really going on.

443
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,917
More importantly,

444
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,959
what will become of that
girl and the old man?

445
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,166
[REINHARD]
In an official capacity,

446
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,792
I cannot overlook what
they've done here.

447
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,291
However, as luck would have it,

448
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,959
I just so happen to
be off-duty today.

449
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,083
[EMILIA chuckles]

450
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,208
Well, aren't you a bad knight.

451
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,625
So this old man is part
of your family, I take it?

452
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:31,500
Yeah, something
like that, I guess.

453
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:35,792
Old Man Rom's the only
person I have in this world.

454
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,875
I suppose he's like my grandpa.

455
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,709
I see. I only have one
family member, too.

456
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,458
He's always asleep at the most
important moments, though.

457
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,583
'Course, I wouldn't say that
out loud when he's awake.

458
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,709
I'd never hear the end of it.

459
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:49,834
Considering what I did,

460
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:53,375
I figured you'd be
a lot harder on me.

461
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,792
You saved my life back there

462
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,333
and I can't let
a debt go unpaid,

463
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,375
so I'll return what I
stole from you, okay?

464
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,500
If it's important,
I suggest you keep it hidden

465
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,083
so no one can steal it again.

466
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,458
[EMILIA]
I appreciate the advice,

467
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:07,125
though, it's a little strange
to hear it from you.

468
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:10,000
[REINHARD gasps]

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,250
What're you doing?

470
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:16,208
Hey! You're hurting me!
Let go of my arm!

471
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,792
This can't be possible!

472
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:18,875
What's your name?

473
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,834
Huh? It's Felt, why do...?

474
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:23,500
Family name? And just
how old are you?

475
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,917
Look, I don't have anything
fancy like a family name.

476
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,834
I'm about... 15,
if I had to guess.

477
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:31,500
I don't know my birthday.

478
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,709
Just let me go!

479
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:34,291
Sorry, Miss Emilia,

480
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,166
but I'm afraid that I can't keep
my promise to you at this time.

481
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,083
I'll be taking this girl with
me for further questioning.

482
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,417
May I ask you why?

483
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,166
If it's just for stealing
my insignia, then...

484
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,125
That theft alone is no
small crime, certainly.

485
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,625
But if I overlook
what's unfolding

486
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:50,083
before me at this moment,

487
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,709
I know it would be the
greatest crime of them all.

488
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,333
I'll need you to
come along with me.

489
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:57,041
I'm sorry, but I simply can't
allow you to refuse.

490
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,291
Get over yourself!

491
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,500
Just because you saved
me doesn't mean you--

492
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,458
That little move didn't
seem very knightly, either.

493
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:06,542
I was careful not
to use too much.

494
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,500
Miss Emilia,
I will most likely be

495
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:11,500
calling upon you
again very soon.

496
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,333
I hope you understand.

497
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:16,250
Please take good care of Subaru.

498
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,083
He's been through a lot.

499
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,625
Tonight may be
our last chance...

500
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:29,250
...to gaze calmly at the moon...

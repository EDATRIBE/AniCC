00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,667
[SUBARU coughing]

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,083
[SUBARU]
No... This is bad... Very bad...

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,125
[SATELLA]
Subaru? What's wrong?

4
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:35,500
I see where this is going.
It's how they suck you in.

5
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,417
[SUBARU]
Run away! Get out of here!

6
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,667
[sighs]

7
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:51,750
[SATELLA screams]

8
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:59,000
Ah, maybe this one instead.

9
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,291
[SUBARU]
Stay with me...

10
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,542
That's 363 yen.

11
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:09,333
[SUBARU]
A jagged-edge ten.

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,667
[SUBARU]
Hang on...

13
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,417
No matter what...

14
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,917
[SUBARU]
...I'm gonna save you...

15
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,542
That's what I get for holing up
in my room all day gaming.

16
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,709
Guess my eyes are tired.

17
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,291
[bell tolls]

18
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,083
[SUBARU]
What's going on?

19
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:19,083
I'd say I was dreaming, but this
is obviously really happening.

20
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,041
Totally not fake.

21
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,583
So does this mean...

22
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:31,583
...I've been summoned across
the universe to another world?!

23
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,834
Well, from the looks of things,

24
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,792
I'd say this is some
kind of fantasy world

25
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,458
with a medieval-style culture.

26
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,542
A realm where demihumans
are commonplace,

27
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,959
and there's always a war
or an adventure to go on.

28
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,166
And in this magical
world, I must've...

29
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,917
[CARRIAGE DRIVER]
Hey! Watch out!

30
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,750
This is it!
It's totally happening!

31
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,875
This must be an event pop where
I'll learn to produce magic!

32
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,333
Ha!

33
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,667
[KNIGHT A]
Look out!

34
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,458
[KNIGHT A laughs]

35
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,542
Yes! Woo!

36
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,875
[BOY A]
Well done!

37
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,667
Guess it's a little
too early for me

38
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,875
to use magic in this world.

39
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,333
[SUBARU]
I can't read any of this.

40
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:51,000
[KADOMON] Hey, boy. Those are
some weird-lookin' clothes.

41
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,166
You're not from
around here, are ya?

42
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,166
So are these...?

43
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,500
Appas, the freshest you'll find.

44
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,417
[SUBARU] At least we
speak the same language.

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,792
Let's see if...

46
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,834
Huh? Where's that money from?

47
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:04,417
You can't use that stuff
out here in Lugunica.

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,041
And if that's all you got,
then you're flat broke.

49
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,959
So don't waste my time,
freeloader! Get outta here!

50
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,959
That answers that.

51
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,458
Guess I'll have to stick to good
old information gathering.

52
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,417
[ALL scream]

53
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,834
This place is for
demihumans only!

54
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,667
[SUBARU]
Ow! My eye! I can't... see...

55
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,458
[screams]

56
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,583
Is this how it's supposed to be?
'Cause none of it makes sense.

57
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,375
This is a different-world
summons, right?!

58
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,041
Where's my main character
set-up and status bar?

59
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,959
Damn.

60
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,166
Tch.

61
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,250
[SUBARU] Looks like my
cell phone still works.

62
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,250
But there's no point
in even having it now!

63
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,875
And the gear they've started
me off with is a joke!

64
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,417
If you're gonna summon lazy-ass
kids like me to your world,

65
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,875
you'd better overhaul your
crappy welfare program!

66
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:17,291
Start me off with an Excalibur
sword or a magic cloak!

67
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,750
And besides, if I were
transported all this way,

68
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,750
where's the cute girl
who brought me here?

69
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:24,625
Why would she do that
and then bail on me?

70
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,583
Yes! You're finally here!

71
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,917
It's nice to meet
you, cute girl...

72
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,375
What are you goin'
on and on about?

73
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,291
If you don't wanna get hurt,
cough up whatever you've got!

74
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,250
Aw, crap. It's already
"compulsory event" time.

75
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,792
[FELT]
Move it, move it!

76
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,208
Move it, you guys!

77
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,291
Hurry! Outta my way!

78
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,792
Yes!

79
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,959
I knew you'd find me eventually,
cute girl who summoned me!

80
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,834
[FELT]
Hm? Summoned?

81
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,291
I dunno what you're talkin'
about, but I'm really busy!

82
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,875
Sorry! Now live strong, okay?

83
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,250
Wait, what?!
Where are you going?!

84
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,792
[SUBARU]
So did seeing that make you feel

85
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,834
any less hostile by any chance?

86
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,000
Actually, it rained on our
parade and made things worse.

87
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,625
Of course, it did...

88
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,542
[SUBARU]
Calm down, Subaru Natsuki.

89
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,709
Since ancient times, it's the
rule that anyone summoned

90
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,458
into a different world
displays supernatural powers!

91
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,125
If I just believe in
myself hard enough,

92
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,834
those powers will kick on and
pave my way to future glory!

93
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,583
[SUBARU]
You lumps of EXP!

94
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,083
That's the first time
I ever hit somebody!

95
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,041
Guess I never
expected it to hurt me!

96
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,375
But it doesn't matter.

97
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,458
Because this world is
set up so I'll be strong!

98
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:43,166
My adrenaline is surging!
I can do anything!

99
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,291
[yelps]

100
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,166
[SUBARU] I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
It was all my fault! Seriously!

101
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,000
Forgive me! Please, spare me!

102
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,417
[CHIN]
Woo-hoo!

103
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,834
[SUBARU screaming]

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,667
[KAN] Play games with us,
will you?! Die, scum!

105
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,417
You like that?! Huh?!

106
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,917
[GIRL]
That's enough.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,125
[BOTH]
Huh?

108
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,625
And just who in
the hell are you?!

109
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:31,917
[GIRL] Stop now,
and I'll forgive you.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,250
If you would be so kind as
to give back what you stole.

111
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,917
[TON]
You can't be serious.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,166
[GIRL] Please.
It's very important to me.

113
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,458
I'll turn the other cheek
concerning the other belongings,

114
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,125
but I can't let you have that.

115
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,750
So hand it over.

116
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,792
You mean you didn't
come to save this kid?

117
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,667
[GIRL]
What strange clothes he has...

118
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,834
If you're asking me if I
have any connection to him,

119
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,250
I'd have to say no.

120
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,542
Well, then you've got no
business with us, little girl!

121
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,166
If someone stole from you, it
was that brat who just ran by!

122
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,291
Yeah, what he said!
That way! She ran that way!

123
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,417
[GIRL]
Hmm...

124
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,041
Those three don't
appear to be lying,

125
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,166
so I need to go after her!

126
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,125
[BOTH sigh]

127
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,417
[GIRL]
But regardless of that...

128
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,959
...I can't overlook
what's going on here.

129
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,750
[SUBARU]
Magic?

130
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,625
Mess with us, will you?

131
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,667
I don't care if you can use
magic, I'm gonna kill you!

132
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,500
You think you can win when it's
two against one?! Do you?!

133
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,625
Indeed. Two against
one may be unfair.

134
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:39,709
[PUCK]
All right, then.

135
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,000
Two against two
should even things up.

136
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,250
Meow.

137
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,083
[TON]
You use the spiritual arts?

138
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,041
Correct. Retreat now,
and I won't chase you.

139
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,875
Decide quickly. I'm in a hurry.

140
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,083
[CHIN]
You bitch!

141
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,458
Next time I see you,
I won't go easy on you!

142
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:01,333
Do anything to her, and I'll
haunt you and your kin forever.

143
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,834
Not that you'll have any kin
if I take care of things now.

144
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:05,041
[BOTH gasp]

145
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,375
[SUBARU sighs]

146
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,083
You really saved me. Thank you.

147
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,500
[GIRL]
Don't move.

148
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,291
A-ha! You avert your eyes due
to your guilty conscience.

149
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,959
Looks like my judgment
was spot-on, as always.

150
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,291
[PUCK]
You sure?

151
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,041
I think it was just an
instinctive male reaction

152
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,625
to avoid tension or rudeness.

153
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:29,417
I didn't sense
any malice at all.

154
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,000
That's enough out of you, Puck.

155
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,542
Now, listen. I want you to
tell me who stole my insignia.

156
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,417
Uh, yeah, really
sorry 'bout this,

157
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,417
but I don't have the slightest
clue to be honest with you.

158
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,000
Wait! Oh no, it couldn't be!

159
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,375
Did I really make a wrong turn,

160
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,125
or maybe come
around the long way?

161
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,667
Heh.

162
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,917
If I were you, I'd hurry after
her before she gets too far.

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,083
I could help, if you...

164
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,417
[PUCK] Aw, you shouldn't
have tried to get up.

165
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,333
What should we do?

166
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:58,792
It's none of our business.

167
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,083
He won't die or anything.
We'll just leave him as-is.

168
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:01,709
[PUCK]
Really?

169
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,083
Yes, really.

170
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,083
[PUCK] You say that, but
I bet you'll still help him.

171
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,208
[GIRL]
I will not!

172
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,750
[PUCK]
Uh-huh, yeah, right.

173
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,125
Absolutely not!

174
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,333
There's no way I'm gonna
save him, understand?!

175
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,709
[SUBARU] Man... she's even
super cute when she's mad.

176
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:18,166
That's another world's
fantasy for you.

177
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,250
Whoa, hang on.
Am I on somebody's lap?

178
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,834
[GIRL]
You're awake?

179
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:31,375
A little weird for a cute girl
to be this hairy, but whatever.

180
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,500
Wait! This can't be right!

181
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,542
[SUBARU yelps]

182
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,083
We were just trying to make
you happy and comfortable

183
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,291
until you woke up.

184
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,000
There's no reason
to get freaked out.

185
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,083
First of all, stop talking
in that high voice.

186
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,709
Nobody with half a brain
would confuse a cat

187
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,000
for the main heroine!

188
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,583
Aww, just listen to you!

189
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,208
Seeing you so happy made turning
myself bigger totally worth it!

190
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,375
I'm not happy at all!

191
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,000
[PUCK chuckles]

192
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,792
[SUBARU]
I'm sorry about this.

193
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,625
You stayed with me the whole
time I was unconscious.

194
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,041
Don't get the wrong idea.

195
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,959
I only stuck around because
there are some things

196
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,458
I want to ask you.

197
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,333
I took the time and trouble
to heal your wounds for you.

198
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,875
I also made Puck
act as your pillow

199
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,125
until you finally woke up.

200
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,542
This was for my own benefit.

201
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,917
But now that you're up,
I need you to repay me in kind.

202
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,375
Well, for such a normal favor,

203
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,417
you're makin' it sound like
I really owe you big time.

204
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,875
That's not the way I see it.

205
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,166
Now then.

206
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,083
You have an idea who
stole my insignia, right?

207
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,500
What?

208
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,458
Hang on, is your insignia
one of those badge things

209
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:25,959
that shows your social status?

210
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,458
A rather crude description,
but that's it, more or less.

211
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,250
About this big with a
jewel in the center.

212
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,625
I'm sorry, but no matter
how many times you ask,

213
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:34,709
I still won't know.

214
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,792
[ I see. I guess there's
no helping that.

215
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,208
But you've given
me the information

216
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,583
that you know nothing,

217
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,125
and that answer was in
exchange for healing you,

218
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,625
so I'm still somewhat satisfied
with how things turned out.

219
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:44,834
Okay?

220
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,792
Well, I'm in quite a
hurry, so I have to go.

221
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,875
Your wounds should
be better now,

222
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,333
but I highly suggest
that next time

223
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,458
you don't do dangerous things

224
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,583
like wander into
deserted alleys alone.

225
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,333
I'm not concerned.
I'm just warning you.

226
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:55,917
If anything like that
happens to you again,

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,500
I already know that saving you
won't be of any benefit to me,

228
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,792
so don't expect any help. Bye!

229
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,875
Sorry. She's so
insincere sometimes.

230
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,166
But don't think
badly of her, okay?

231
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,583
Insincere, huh...

232
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,375
I think this goes beyond that.

233
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,250
She was in such a hurry to
find what was stolen from her,

234
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,959
yet she stopped to help me.

235
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,709
She even came up with that
lame excuse for a favor

236
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,709
even though I'm
a total stranger.

237
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,792
Anyone who lives like that...

238
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,709
...is just gonna end up
wasting their whole life!

239
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,583
Hey! Wait up!

240
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,875
Was there something
else you needed?

241
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,208
Just so you know,
I can only spend

242
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,875
a little more time
with you, okay?

243
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,667
Ah, figured you were
gonna shut me down...

244
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,583
Anyway, you lost something
important, right?

245
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,375
Well, then let me
help you find it.

246
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,750
You said you didn't know
anything about my insignia.

247
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,125
But I can remember her face!

248
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,208
If I see her again, I'll know!

249
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,917
You're so strange.

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,583
Well, anyway, I won't be
able to offer you any reward.

251
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,750
Listen, I don't need one.

252
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,375
I'm here because
I wanna thank you.

253
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,000
And to show how much
I appreciate your help.

254
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,166
I didn't do anything
deserving of that.

255
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,041
I told you, I've already
received amicable compensation

256
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,625
for healing your wounds.

257
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,041
In that case...

258
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,417
I guess I'm gonna help
you for my own sake, too.

259
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,041
I should probably set
an objective so, uh...

260
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,375
Right! One good deed per day!

261
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,166
Uh...

262
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,834
I don't sense any malice here,

263
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,959
so I think you can
just accept his offer.

264
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,625
After all, the more shields
between you and ruffians,

265
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:32,875
the better.

266
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,625
A shield?! That's what
you want me around for?!

267
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:35,792
I meant what I said, though.

268
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,583
I can't do anything
to reward you.

269
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:40,583
No problem at all.
Just leave everything to me!

270
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,792
[SUBARU]
I know what I told you before,

271
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,166
but isn't this town too huge
to find one little thing in?

272
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,583
This "town" is the
capital of Lugunica.

273
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,000
How could you possibly
not know that? Uh...

274
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,750
[PUCK] Hey, that's right.
How rude of us!

275
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,208
We haven't asked his name yet.

276
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,000
Shouldn't we all
introduce ourselves?

277
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,583
Oh, yeah, guess so.

278
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,959
Might as well go ahead and get
the ball rolling first, then.

279
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,583
My name is Subaru Natsuki.

280
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:22,166
Not only am I totally clueless,
I'm also broke beyond compare!

281
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,417
Nice to meet ya!

282
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,458
[PUCK] When that's how
you introduce yourself,

283
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,625
you really do sound hopeless.

284
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:30,959
And my name is Puck!
It's nice to meet you!

285
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,667
It's very unusual
to see someone

286
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,834
who can touch a spirit
so casually like that.

287
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,125
Where are you from exactly?

288
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,917
Well, if things follow
the usual pattern,

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,500
it's a small island
nation to the east.

290
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:45,333
But Lugunica is the easternmost
nation on our continental map.

291
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,625
There are no more countries
in that direction.

292
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,250
No way, really? There's
nothing east of here?

293
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,834
You have no idea where you are,

294
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,625
you have no money,
you can't read,

295
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,834
and you seem to have no one
around who can help you.

296
00:14:56,917 --> 00:15:00,667
You might be in an even more
precarious position than I am...

297
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,291
Uh, Subaru, right?

298
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,333
[SUBARU]
Uh.

299
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,750
Yes, that's my name.

300
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,458
All that aside, I gotta admit,

301
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,166
you seem like you're
in pretty good shape.

302
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,125
I do try to work out every day.

303
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,875
Ya see, when you're the shut-in
protector of your own house,

304
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,834
you gotta stay fit
as much as possible.

305
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,750
I'm not sure if I understand
exactly what a "shut-in" is,

306
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:22,875
but I assume it means you're
from a reputable family, right?

307
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,166
[SUBARU]
Hey, what're you...?

308
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,417
[GIRL] Your fingers, too.
They're very pretty.

309
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,000
They don't look like the working
hands of a peasant at all.

310
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,083
And your muscles don't look
like the kind you gain

311
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,834
from doing field work.

312
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,500
Uh, um, yeah, so anyway,
I know your cat's name now,

313
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,583
but I still haven't heard
you say your name yet.

314
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:39,750
Oh, my name?

315
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,709
[SUBARU chuckles]

316
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:42,917
It's...

317
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,667
It's Satella.

318
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,000
No family name.

319
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,834
So that's the way you may
address me, all right?

320
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,834
I see. Satella it is.

321
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,875
That's a nice name.

322
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,125
[gasps]

323
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,500
[PUCK sighs]

324
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,750
You have got terrible taste.

325
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,667
Right, time to get
back to askin' around!

326
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,667
[SATELLA]
Subaru...

327
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,959
That child over there, do you
get the feeling she's lost?

328
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Maybe, but what
about our questioning?

329
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,291
That's also important.

330
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,083
But if she's lost,
we have to do something.

331
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,458
I'm in no place to talk
after you saved me,

332
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:31,542
but do you fully comprehend
the position we're in?

333
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,291
I do.

334
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:38,000
But there's a little girl who's
crying! You can see that, right?

335
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,417
If you don't want to do
this with me, that's fine.

336
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,375
Thanks for your
assistance, Subaru.

337
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,959
I'm sure I can handle things
on my own from here on out.

338
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,667
But first, I'm gonna
help that little girl.

339
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,625
[gasps]

340
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:55,041
Hey, there. It looks like
something's the matter.

341
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,625
Maybe I can help you.

342
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,000
Did you come here on your own,
or with your mommy and daddy?

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,458
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to make you cry!

344
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:09,458
I'm just here to help, not to
do anything bad, I promise.

345
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,583
[SUBARU] What you see before
you is a rarity around here.

346
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,291
A jagged-edge ten-yen coin!

347
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,000
Observe closely as
I take this coin

348
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,709
and clutch it
tightly in my hand.

349
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,834
Tight, tight, tight. Like that!

350
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,625
Now, where'd it go?

351
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,709
[gasps]

352
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,583
[chuckles]

353
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,959
Well, take a look at this!

354
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,500
I figured out where
the coin was hiding.

355
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,375
Here ya go, it's yours.

356
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,542
Like I said, it's rare,
so take good care of it.

357
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Thank you, sir!

358
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,458
[SUBARU] I see. You got
separated from your mom, huh?

359
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,542
Yeah, that can be kinda scary.

360
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,583
Well, don't worry.
We'll help you.

361
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,000
Me and this young
lady right here?

362
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,041
We'll find them
in no time for ya.

363
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,875
Wow, look at us.

364
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,291
People who don't know
us probably think

365
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,625
they're looking at a
young married couple

366
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:58,709
and their kid, huh?

367
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:00,208
Is that embarrassing or what?

368
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,959
[SATELLA] At best I can't really
see you as anything more

369
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,250
than her older brother.

370
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,166
What makes you think
I'm so young, huh?!

371
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,583
Ah! Mommy!

372
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,625
[GIRL A]
Mommy!

373
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:14,625
It looks like she
finally found her.

374
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:17,291
Yeah. I'm so relieved.

375
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,875
[SUBARU]
Okay... so...

376
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:21,542
In my opinion, that whole string
of events with the little girl

377
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,041
was nothin' but a side-quest,

378
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,959
but what benefit will you
insist that you got out of it?

379
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,917
Go on, tell me!

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,333
That's easy.

381
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,000
Now we can continue our
search with our minds at ease

382
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,083
knowing we did the right thing.

383
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,542
Anyway, why'd you end up
helping me with that?

384
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,333
Thought you said you
were against the idea.

385
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:37,875
Could say I just wanted
to show off my magic trick,

386
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,125
but that'd be a lie.

387
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,166
Like I told you before,
finding your insignia

388
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,000
will be my one good
deed for the day!

389
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,125
[SATELLA]
I know that was the plan,

390
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,542
but since you helped
the little girl,

391
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,291
isn't your one good deed over?

392
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,542
You are being super nitpicky!

393
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,709
It doesn't hurt to do more
than one nice thing in a day,

394
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:52,792
does it?

395
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,083
I just got tomorrow's
out of the way.

396
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,750
My plan is to get a week's
worth of good deeds

397
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,959
taken care of early!

398
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,542
If I were to guess,

399
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,125
you're the type that basically
wastes their whole life, right?

400
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,625
Seriously?

401
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,667
You're the last person who
should be saying that to anyone.

402
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,500
I admit you're not
a bad boy, though.

403
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,667
Why do you act like I'm
so much younger than you?

404
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,834
Honestly, I'm
guessing there aren't

405
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,500
that many differences
between us.

406
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,583
Well, you may think that,

407
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,959
but all of your guesses
would be wrong.

408
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,083
Because... I'm
actually half-elf.

409
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,709
[SUBARU]
Ah, no wonder.

410
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,083
It makes sense now.

411
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,667
From the moment I saw you...
I thought you were cute!

412
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,417
Elves are always
beautiful, aren't they?

413
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,667
[SATELLA gasps]

414
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,875
What is it?

415
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,291
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

416
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,625
Listen, I'm trying to tell
you that I'm a half-elf.

417
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,083
Yeah, I heard you.

418
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,917
[PUCK yells]

419
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,750
What the heck did
you do that for?

420
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,000
I just had to do something

421
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,959
about this unbearable
tingle I'm feeling!

422
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,041
That's the weirdest reason

423
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,750
for punching somebody
I've ever heard.

424
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,667
Though I'll forgive you
since it was squishy.

425
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,041
I didn't hit you in the face
out of anger or anything.

426
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,208
In fact, it was
quite the opposite.

427
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,667
Subaru, you are
such a dunderhead!

428
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,208
Yeah, so who says "dunderhead"
in this day and age?

429
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,500
And why are you insulting
me in the first place?

430
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,959
Ugh! Whatever!

431
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,542
More importantly, we have
to get back to the search.

432
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,458
So let's go.

433
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:17,959
Hey, wait a minute!

434
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,625
Just running around without
a plan is never a good idea.

435
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,458
There's a basic
rule of searches.

436
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,792
What are you talking about?

437
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,041
Yeah, like revisiting
the scene of the crime.

438
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,208
Where exactly was your
insignia stolen?

439
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,125
And then she told me it
was right around here,

440
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,166
so after I insisted that she
leave everything to me,

441
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,875
I valiantly came back
to this fruit stand

442
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,166
to look for some clues.

443
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,375
I thought I had a customer,

444
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,000
but you're that same
broke kid from earlier.

445
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,000
[SUBARU] You really
wanna take that attitude?

446
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,750
Haven't you noticed I'm
not who I was before?

447
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:44,875
[KADOMON]
Huh?

448
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:46,458
Just look who I brought with me!

449
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:50,041
I bet it's someone who just
might become a regular!

450
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,333
[SATELLA]
Uh, Subaru...

451
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,041
I'm not exactly sure what
you expected of me,

452
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,291
but I actually don't
have any money, either.

453
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,583
[SUBARU]
Huh? S-Seriously?

454
00:20:58,667 --> 00:20:59,959
So what did you
wanna ask me about

455
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,625
now that I'm stuck
here with not one,

456
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:04,417
but two broke customers, boy?

457
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,125
Well, we're actually
looking for someone,

458
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,208
and we were hoping we could
ask you a few questions,

459
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,250
if you wouldn't mind...

460
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,625
That was a sarcastic
way of saying

461
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,458
I don't have time
for broke losers!

462
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:13,917
Now get outta here! Scram!

463
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,166
[GIRL A]
Hey, mister!

464
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,250
[ALL]
Huh?

465
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,041
Thanks for your help earlier.

466
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,875
[SUBARU]
What brings you back this way?

467
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,041
It's my husband's shop,
so we just wanted to stop by.

468
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,000
[KADOMON sighs]

469
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,500
Your husband?

470
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:32,125
[KADOMON]
Hey, there's my girl.

471
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,000
Now wait a second,
how exactly do you know

472
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,875
these two good-for-nothings?

473
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,750
She got lost, and
these two found her,

474
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,792
then helped bring
her back to me.

475
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,625
[SUBARU chuckles nervously]

476
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:44,125
Thanks again, lady. Here!

477
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,667
She was hoping we'd find you.

478
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,083
Please accept that token as
her way of showing gratitude

479
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,667
for what you've done.

480
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,542
Thank you very much.

481
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,417
[KADOMON clears throat]

482
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,458
Sorry about all that before.

483
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,458
You helped my daughter,

484
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,000
and I wanna show
my appreciation,

485
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,917
so ask me anything.

486
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,041
There, you see?

487
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,041
A little bit of extra effort
on our part came back around

488
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,959
and worked in our favor!

489
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,917
The air, the atmosphere,
and, most likely,

490
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,458
the attitudes of the people
living here are awful.

491
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:42,125
Are you sure she's
really out here?

492
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,125
You're sayin' she's a
nimble little blonde, right?

493
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,417
'Cause it might
be that Felt girl

494
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,041
I see around from time to time.

495
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,625
She's well-known in the slums.

496
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:52,375
Dunno where she lives, though.
That's about all I can tell ya.

497
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,625
[SATELLA] Maybe someone
will tell us if we ask.

498
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:56,125
[PUCK]
No one would sell out their own,

499
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,875
especially to a
couple of strangers,

500
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,625
so asking would be useless.

501
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:02,083
Maybe we should just
come back later.

502
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,417
Whatever it is you wanna do,

503
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,583
I suggest that
you decide quickly.

504
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,709
'Cause I've just about
run outta time here.

505
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,542
"Out of time"?
What do you mean?

506
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,750
I'm able to take on this cute
appearance, but I'm a spirit.

507
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:16,709
It takes a lot of mana for me
to appear in physical form.

508
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:18,291
So when the day becomes night,

509
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,333
I return to the crystal
I was summoned from

510
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,917
and prepare for
the sun to emerge.

511
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,834
On average, my ideal
time to stay out

512
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:26,458
is roughly nine to five.

513
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:27,458
Nine to five?

514
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:29,166
Sounds like you
work in an office.

515
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,041
Employment terms for
spirits are pretty severe.

516
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,542
We'll be fine without Puck.

517
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,458
We need to keep
moving forward on this.

518
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:40,000
Sorry, but I'm at my limit.
Good luck, you two.

519
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,458
It's almost like he's
dying when he disappears.

520
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:44,792
Sorry to've worked you
so hard today, Puck.

521
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:48,208
We'll handle things from here,
so settle in and get some rest.

522
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,458
Don't do anything
reckless, all right?

523
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:53,709
If it comes down to it,

524
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:56,709
you can always use the
od to summon me again.

525
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:59,959
I'm leaving things in your
hands, Subaru! Good luck!

526
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,500
Hey, wow, I don't think
I've been in one of these

527
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,291
"alone with a girl" situations
since I was in grade school.

528
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,625
Don't get any pervy
ideas, Subaru.

529
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,333
I can use magic, you know.

530
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,125
I won't, okay?!

531
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,625
The more important issue at
hand is how we find Felt now.

532
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:26,000
[SATELLA]
I'll contact the lesser spirits.

533
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,208
[SUBARU]
Lesser spirits?

534
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,458
[SATELLA]
Precisely.

535
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,166
They're beings that
haven't quite become

536
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,625
full-fledged spirits yet.

537
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:33,333
They grow little
by little over time,

538
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:35,542
and when they gain enough
strength and self-awareness,

539
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,208
they become full
spirits, just like Puck.

540
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,041
[SUBARU]
Huh?

541
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,709
[SATELLA] It's getting
more desolate and quiet.

542
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:25,375
Hard to believe that she
actually lives out here.

543
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:28,208
I know, but the lesser
spirits specifically said

544
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:31,542
they saw someone who looked like
Felt headed in this direction.

545
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,875
'Scuse me, man!

546
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:39,500
Know if a girl named Felt
lives somewhere up this way?

547
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,291
Huh? You're lookin' for Felt?

548
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,250
There's nothing that way except
Old Man Rom's loot house.

549
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:48,166
Hah, I guess she must've stolen
something pretty important

550
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,709
for you two to come out here.

551
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:51,208
Well, I wish you
luck on bargaining

552
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,458
to try to get it back.

553
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:54,208
Live strong, okay?

554
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,375
[SATELLA]
What was he talking about?

555
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,542
Why do I have to pay money

556
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,083
to get back something
stolen from me?

557
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,375
[SUBARU]
Don't worry about a thing.

558
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,166
Just leave everything to me.

559
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,291
I can handle the negotiations.

560
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:14,458
All right, then. I'll just
leave everything in your hands.

561
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:16,417
You agreed to that
pretty easily.

562
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,959
I figured you'd
say something like

563
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:20,125
"You want me to leave this
to a useless boy like you?

564
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,917
That's such a ridiculous idea,
it actually hurts my stomach!"

565
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,625
And although that would
stomp all over my feelings,

566
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,375
I'd still decide to keep
helping you anyway.

567
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,709
I'd never say something
that mean to anyone!

568
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:31,000
Of course, to tell you the
truth, I'd be lying if I said

569
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,917
you haven't been holding
me back a little bit.

570
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,542
Oh, great! That's good to know!

571
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,834
But again...

572
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:38,250
...I'm leaving
this in your hands.

573
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:42,166
If it actually goes well,
I'll consider it a bonus.

574
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,125
Now, ya know, if you said
something more like,

575
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,417
"Work hard for me, okay?"

576
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,417
I'd probably feel a whole
lot more motivated.

577
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,625
Sorry, I can't force myself
to say something like that.

578
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,917
However, please do your best.

579
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,375
Yeah, you got it.

580
00:26:57,458 --> 00:27:00,083
I'll go in first. You stay
outside and keep watch.

581
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,583
I won't be back too late,

582
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,208
but you can have dinner without
me if you get too hungry.

583
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:06,166
[SATELLA] Don't say dumb things
like that. And be careful.

584
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,625
[SUBARU]
Sure, sure.

585
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,875
Now don't come in until I say
it's all right, Satella.

586
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,417
What's the matter?

587
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,792
Nothing, never mind.

588
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,959
If you can manage to
get my insignia back,

589
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,709
then I'll apologize.

590
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,166
Anybody here?

591
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,208
Nope.

592
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,792
[SUBARU] So am I walking into
a demon nest or a snake pit?

593
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:38,500
In a fantasy world,
either is totally plausible.

594
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,333
This is all stolen loot?

595
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,875
Impressive. But why
isn't anyone here?

596
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:46,041
A shack full of stolen goods
and no one around to guard it?

597
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,500
[squelching]

598
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,542
[SUBARU]
Uh.

599
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,917
[gasps]

600
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,875
[VOICE]
Oh, dear, you found that?

601
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,625
Well, I have no choice, then.

602
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:17,709
No choice at all...

603
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,834
[SUBARU]
Agh... that burns...

604
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:36,834
[SUBARU] Oh, crap...
Is all of this my blood?

605
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:42,125
[SUBARU]
No... This is bad... Very bad...

606
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,000
[SATELLA]
Subaru? What's wrong?

607
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,000
You okay...?

608
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,500
Don't come in!

609
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:52,208
Run away! Get out of here!

610
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,417
--[thud]
--[SATELLA screams]

611
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,834
[SUBARU]
Stay with me...

612
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:16,208
Hang on.

613
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,583
No matter what happens...

614
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:21,875
...I'm gonna save you...

615
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,500
What's the matter with you, kid?

616
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:30,834
It looks like you've seen
a ghost or somethin'.

617
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:32,375
Huh?

618
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,875
You were askin' about these
and I told you they were appas.

619
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,667
So are you interested
in buying some or not?

620
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,542
Huh?

621
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,333
"Huh?" Stop screwin' around!

622
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:42,792
Do you want one or not?
You even have any money?

623
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,166
Ohh! No.

624
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,709
Like I said before, I don't
have any money on me,

625
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:46,875
I'm just browsing.

626
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,709
I figured as much;
should've known better.

627
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:49,709
Go on, beat it.

628
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:51,083
I run a business here.

629
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,750
I don't have time for
window-shoppers, understand?

630
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:07,792
What's going on?

631
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:12,250
It was nighttime just a
few minutes ago, right?

632
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,667
The wound on my
stomach is gone.

633
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,542
Oh, that's right!
Satella! Damn it.

634
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:22,375
Puck asked me to take care of
her and I totally blew it!

635
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,917
I have to find my way
back to that shop!

636
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,917
What's got you so spooked?
Why are you in such a hurry?

637
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,041
If you don't wanna get hurt,

638
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,709
then cough up
whatever you've got!

639
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,250
You guys again?

640
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,291
Tryin' to get revenge for what
happened before, is that it?

641
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,208
Huh? The hell are
you talkin' about?

642
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,959
I think he must've hit
his head or something.

643
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,208
Nah, he'll be all right.

644
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,333
Just give us everything
you've got, understand?

645
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,166
Put it on the ground
and we'll let you go.

646
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,291
Fine, whatever.
Everything I've got, right?

647
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,834
I'm in a hurry,
so I don't even care.

648
00:30:57,917 --> 00:30:59,583
Now start acting like a dog.

649
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:03,500
Just get on all fours like and
howl, "Help me!" like a mongrel.

650
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:06,709
[SUBARU]
Don't get cocky, you bastards!

651
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:11,458
[SUBARU yells]

652
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:20,000
[SUBARU] Don't ever
underestimate a truant kid

653
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,583
with too much free time.

654
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,792
'Cause I usually end up swinging
around a wooden sword all day

655
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,125
for no reason, which has
given me a significant bump

656
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,625
to my grip strength!

657
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:37,291
I'm in a hurry, okay?!
So don't get in my way again!

658
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:43,500
Easy now, don't freak out, don't
freak out, don't freak out!

659
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:52,250
[SUBARU]
Am I stupid?

660
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:55,333
After coming this far, I can't
just leave without answers!

661
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,041
Hello, is anyone there?

662
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,792
Look, I know someone's
in there, all right?!

663
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:04,583
Just answer the door and
show yourself! Come on!

00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,083
[ROM]
Shut your trap!

665
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,208
Why don't you use
signal or a password

666
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,667
instead of knockin'
my damn door down?!

actin' all fidgety for?

You got a wedgie, or
are your balls chafin'?

671

Why don't you stop worrying

about the condition
of my privates, okay?!

This is no time for potty humor!

You're already interruptin'
my evenin' booze.

675
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,166
Start talking about boring
stuff, and I'll pass out.

while the sun's still up,

ask you a dumb question?

die recently, did you?

00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:05,000
Okay, then have you seen a girl
here with long, silver hair?

685
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,583
Silver hair?

686
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:10,500
I ain't seen nobody that fits
that description. I'd remember.

687
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,250
[SUBARU]
Was it all a dream, then?

688
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,417
If it was, how much of it?

689
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,959
And why am I in this
world in the first place?

690
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,667
So what are you
doin' here, anyway?

691
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,208
You never made that clear.

692
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,959
O-Oh, right. I'm out looking
for a small insignia.

693
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:27,709
It belongs to a silver-haired
girl who helped me out, earlier.

694
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:30,500
Don't know why, exactly, but
it's really important to her.

695
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,750
Let's see...

696
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:34,542
I think she said it had
a jewel in the middle...

697
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:37,291
Insignia with a jewel, huh?

698
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:40,458
Sorry, but I ain't got anything
that fits that description.

699
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:41,417
Are you positive?

700
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,917
Think long and hard about it!

701
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,500
Maybe you're just
old and senile.

702
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:47,625
I'm at my best full of booze,
so if I don't remember it now,

703
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:50,125
I must not know
anything about it.

704
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:53,083
But... I've got
somebody bringin' in

705
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,667
a few goods later on.

706
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,041
I'm told it's a pretty
fine pile of loot.

707
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,417
And there's a good chance
that what you're lookin' for

708
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,166
is mixed in there somewhere.

709
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,625
Would the one bringing it
happen to be a girl named Felt?

710
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,667
Well, Mister Know-It-All,
you even know who swiped it!

711
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,083
Of course, whether or not
you'll be able to afford it

712
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,083
is a different matter.

713
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:12,291
Money talks, and B.S. walks.

714
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,375
Well, you're outta luck!

715
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:14,750
There's no use playing
these mind games

716
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:15,959
and trying to size me up.

717
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm about as broke
as they come, buddy.

718
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,625
Then there ain't no
use talkin' about it.

719
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:21,166
Just a second.

720
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,667
I told you I was broke, but what
about the option of trading?

721
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,583
[ROM]
Hmm...

722
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:25,750
Now that you mention it,

723
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:28,166
you do have a lot of
unusual stuff there.

724
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,333
[SUBARU]
That I do!

725
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,750
For example, this is
a corn potage snack.

726
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,500
You've never tasted
anything like it!

727
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,333
[ROM]
That's food?

728
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:45,333
I see now! Yeah!
What an odd flavor!

729
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,166
These things would
go great with booze!

730
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,667
That's right!
Now you're talkin'!

731
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,417
Hey! Don't just
start eating them!

732
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,166
I dunno what you
plan on tradin',

733
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,625
but you'll have to come back
after Felt gets here, okay?

734
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,542
This is good stuff!

735
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:11,375
I guess no matter what
world you're on,

736
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:14,208
there are always people with
money and people without.

737
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,583
I will say, the difference
here is pretty stark.

738
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,917
[FELT]
Hey, what're you doin' there?

739
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,583
You're in my way, ya know.

740
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,208
[SUBARU]
Felt!

741
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,917
Hang on a second,
have we met before?

742
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,667
[SUBARU] Not formally, no.
But I've been waiting for you!

743
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,250
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

744
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,125
Come on, try and
think about this.

745
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,166
Do you really not remember
seeing me before?

746
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,333
Huh, nothin's ringing any bells.

747
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,208
Listen, I'm a busy woman, okay?

748
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,667
So if you don't leave
a huge impression,

749
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,125
there's no way I'm
gonna remember you.

750
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,667
I'd say it was a pretty huge
impression, but whatever.

751
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,166
Just forget about that.

752
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,917
I want to negotiate
for the insignia

753
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,458
you're bringin' in there.

754
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,417
[FELT]
Hmm...

755
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,000
So that's all ya wanted, huh?

756
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,417
In that case, I guess
I'll hear you out.

757
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,917
[ROM]
For a rat...

758
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,667
Poison.

759
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,125
[ROM]
For a whale...

760
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,166
A harpoon.

761
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,458
[ROM]
To the noble dragon lord...

762
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:07,125
We're bags of shit.

763
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,959
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting, old man.

764
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,083
My target was more
persistent than I thought.

765
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,583
It took a while to shake them.

766
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,333
Hey, did you water down this
milk or what, Old Man Rom?

767
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,166
'Cause there's definitely
something wrong with it.

768
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,583
Pretty nasty stuff.

769
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:25,291
I give you somethin' outta
the goodness of my heart,

770
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,250
and you call it gross?

771
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,583
You two are a whole lot closer

772
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:30,375
than I had either
hoped or expected.

773
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,250
Feelin' kinda left
out over here...

774
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,041
Come on, don't start
talkin' like a wuss

775
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,417
when you've got a face that
looks almost as scary as his.

776
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,208
Tellin' me I look like
an old man at my age

777
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,417
is the most savage thing
anyone's ever said to me.

778
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,166
Okay, yeah, I probably went
a little too far that time.

779
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,125
I'm sorry, dude.

780
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,667
If I didn't know any better,

781
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,875
I'd say you two were in some
contest to try to piss me off.

782
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,125
All right, well then,

783
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,750
what do you say we get
down to business, huh?

784
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,125
How much are you
willing to pay for it?

785
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,792
Wow, you don't waste
any time at all.

786
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,375
Before I give you an answer,
you do have the insignia, right?

787
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:01,041
Yeah, of course I do, silly!

788
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,417
Satisfied?

789
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,458
This one not only
has a cool design,

790
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:09,792
it's got that jewel in it.

791
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,709
So I had to work pretty
hard to get a hold of it.

792
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,875
If you can pay enough to
match all the effort involved,

793
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:14,834
we'll both be happy.

794
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:16,709
I don't have any money.

795
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:19,333
Then it sounds like we don't
have anything more to discuss!

796
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:20,875
[SUBARU]
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

797
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:24,375
I don't have any money, but
I have a few things worth money.

798
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:28,125
What I have in my hand
here is a magical device

799
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,667
that can stop time for
everyone, everywhere.

800
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,917
It's called a "cell phone"!

801
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
[FELT]
What's that?

802
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,875
[ROM]
Never seen one of those before.

803
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:37,959
Take this!

804
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,000
Nine shots per second:
Continuous Shot!

805
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:40,917
[BOTH yelp]

00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,208
Hey, what's that
clicking sound?!

807
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:43,417
And that was way too bright!

808
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,542
Stop! What are you
tryin' to do, kill me?

809
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,208
Don't you go tryin'
to trick this old man

810
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,625
with your dodgy tricks!

811
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:50,041
[SUBARU]
Now, hold on.

812
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,208
Wait, is that...?

813
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,458
[ROM]
Those are me and Felt's faces.

814
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,125
What sort of magic is that?

815
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,542
[SUBARU]
It's like I was tellin' you,

816
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:00,834
it's a mystical item that can
freeze a moment in time.

817
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:03,583
With this unique device,
you can capture moments in time,

818
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,709
store them inside of it,
and look at them later!

819
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:07,750
[FELT]
Oh, wow! That's amazing!

820
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:09,166
[ROM]
Never seen the like.

821
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,542
Is that one of the "metia"
I've been hearin' about?

822
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,667
What's a metia?

823
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,000
It's the name for devices

824
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,959
that allow people whose
gates aren't open

825
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:19,834
to use magic in the very same
way that real magic users do.

826
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,500
I'm more concerned
with the price.

827
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,000
How much do you think
I'll be able to get

828
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,291
outta this thing, anyway?

829
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,291
Don't ask me.

830
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:26,792
It's my first time
havin' to deal

831
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,458
with one of these metia, too.

832
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:31,000
But I feel pretty confident
that it'll fetch way more

833
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,458
than that insignia.

834
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,625
Then that settles it! This
cell phone for the insignia!

835
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:37,542
Negotiations complete!
Thank you for your business.

836
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,125
Hey!

837
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,208
Uh, not so fast.

838
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,417
[SUBARU]
What's the problem?

839
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,125
You're not the only one
I'm negotiating with

840
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,125
for the insignia.

841
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,375
[SUBARU]
Huh?

842
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,959
It's not like it was
just some random grab,

843
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,500
somebody specifically
asked me to get it for them.

844
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:52,542
In exchange, that same client
said I could get ten holy coins.

845
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,625
You've already got
a deal set up for it?

846
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:57,959
I have no idea what ten holy
coins are worth to compare.

847
00:38:58,041 --> 00:38:59,333
[ROM]
Judging by what it can do,

848
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:02,583
I'd say your metia is worth
at least 20 holy coins.

849
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,542
Actually, I'm guessin'
there're people out there

850
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,291
who'd be willin'
to pay even more.

851
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,792
[FELT]
Really?

852
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,583
Then that means I can get
away with overcharging for it!

853
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:11,417
So when and where are
you planning on meeting

854
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,542
this client of yours?

855
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:13,709
Hey, no need to worry.

856
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,417
Negotiations will take
place right here.

857
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,166
If a little thing like me
dealt with them alone,

858
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,542
I'd be screwed if a client
decided to cheat me.

859
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,709
But with Old Man Rom standing
there, that's not a concern.

860
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:26,166
[knocking]

861
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,417
The password?

862
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,959
[FELT] Oh, I didn't
mention it to them.

863
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,291
That's probably for me.
I'll go check.

864
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,041
[SUBARU] You're okay with
letting her use you like this?

865
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,583
It ain't like we're total
strangers, or anything.

866
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,291
I've known her for a long time,

867
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,792
so I help her out
whenever I can.

868
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:46,250
Even I have to smile a little

869
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,458
when I see somebody who
looks like such a barbarian

870
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,041
standing right
here in front of me.

871
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,542
Well, look at where we are.

872
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,291
Everyone around
here is desperate

873
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:54,834
just to survive each day.

874
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:57,000
Normally, people join
forces with others

875
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:00,166
to try and keep themselves
safe when things get rough.

876
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,125
But Felt ain't
cut out for that.

877
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,625
That's why I gotta look out for
her and keep her outta trouble.

878
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:10,041
[FELT]
Yep, I was right. It was for me.

879
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:12,083
Over here. Care to sit down?

880
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,291
There seem to be
several outsiders here.

881
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,333
[FELT] Well, I'd be in
trouble if you jipped me.

882
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:18,625
We weaklings have our own
way of playing it smart.

883
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:19,875
I know this older fellow,

884
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,834
but I'm afraid I don't
recognize the young man.

885
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:25,000
He happens to be your rival.

886
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:28,500
So he'll be the other person
negotiating with you today.

887
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,417
I see now.

888
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,250
Believe I understand
the situation.

889
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,542
I'm pretty sure he's only
interested in the insignia,

890
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,709
so that means you two will be
bidding against each other.

891
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:47,417
I honestly don't care
who ends up with it,

892
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,750
so I'll sell it to
the highest bidder

893
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:50,792
and be completely
satisfied doing so.

894
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:53,250
I think I like that
personality of yours.

895
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,000
Exactly how much did this
young man bid for the item?

896
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,500
I'm putting up this metia.

897
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:58,959
It's pretty rare too,

898
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,125
probably the only one of its
kind in this entire world.

899
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,625
It can capture moments in time.

900
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:04,250
The big muscleman
over here tells me

901
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,667
it's worth no less
than 20 holy coins.

902
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,834
A metia.

903
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:13,250
Well, luckily for me,

904
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:16,083
the client sent along extra
funds in case anything came up.

905
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,417
That way, I'd be prepared
to sweeten the deal.

906
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,959
The client, huh?

907
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,667
So I suppose that means you were
asked to fetch it too, then,

908
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,375
weren't you?

909
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,667
Yes, that's correct.

910
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,834
The client is the one
who wants to acquire it.

911
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,625
Would you happen to be
in the same business?

912
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:30,709
Doubt it, unless your client
is gamefully unemployed.

913
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,792
So this unemployed
guy has named a price

914
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,834
that puts him pretty
far ahead in the lead.

915
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,208
And that brings us to this:

916
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:39,417
What price is your
master putting on it?

917
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,583
[ROM]
Hmm. Twenty, exactly.

918
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:55,834
These are the holy coins
my employer sent with me

919
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,166
to seal this deal.

920
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,917
So do you think they
should be enough?

921
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,875
What's wrong with you?
Don't you know how to bargain?

922
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,417
Stop lookin' so pathetic!

923
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,291
Your metia's worth no less
than 20 holy coins, remember?

924
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,250
The way I see it,
victory in this deal

925
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,166
is definitely leaning
toward the boy.

926
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,542
Sorry for all the trouble for
you and your employer,

927
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:17,959
but you'd better bag up those
coins and be on your way.

928
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,291
[SUBARU]
Yeah!

929
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,667
[SUBARU] Wh-What? What's wrong
with a little victory pose?

930
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,375
I'm totally psyched about this!

931
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,375
[FELT]
So... no one said anything.

932
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:32,875
Go as crazy as you want.

933
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:35,166
I don't care as long
as I get my profit.

934
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,917
[SUBARU]
Uh, sorry, Miss Elsa.

935
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,667
You'll probably get in trouble
about this, won't you?

936
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,625
[ELSA]
These things can't be helped.

937
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:44,250
The way I see it, this
was my employer's fault

938
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,291
for trying to underpay.

939
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:52,208
It ended in disappointment, but
at least I got to have a drink.

940
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:54,667
So I'll be taking my leave now.

941
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:57,750
[ELSA]
By the way,

942
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:00,458
what do you intend to do
with that insignia, anyway?

943
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:03,458
Oh, I'm gonna look for its
owner, then return it to her.

944
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:04,667
[BOTH gasp]

945
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,583
I see. So you're
with them, then.

946
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:17,917
What's goin' on here?

947
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,458
Do you want to die?!

948
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:22,792
[ELSA] Oh, my. It seems
you've dodged my strike.

949
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:27,709
[clatter]

950
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:34,458
This is my first battle
to the death with a giant!

951
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:35,834
Quiet, jumpy little girl!

952
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:38,667
I'll grind you up and
feed you to the rats!

953
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:53,875
Crap!

954
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:56,375
Don't worry, there's no
way Old Man Rom will lose.

955
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,208
Take this!

956
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:04,750
Old Man Rom!

957
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,250
[ROM]
Damn it.

958
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:10,709
[ELSA]
I forgot to say--

959
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm gonna take you with me!

960
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:19,458
Thank you for that
nice glass of milk.

961
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:29,333
I suppose I should
return this now.

962
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:32,875
What have you done?

963
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:35,458
How dare you put your filthy
hands on him, you bitch.

964
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:38,583
Oh, my. Seems you have more
courage than your friend.

965
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:40,959
But I would advise against
doing anything stupid,

966
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:42,542
unless you wanna get hurt.

967
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:45,417
As if you didn't intend
to kill me either way.

968
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,375
You psychopathic monster!

969
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:50,125
Wouldn't move around too much,
dear. My hands might slip.

970
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:53,000
Believe it or not, I'm not
the best at handling blades.

971
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,458
I'm sorry you got caught
up in all of this.

972
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:57,166
[SUBARU]
Wait, I--

973
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,750
[ELSA]
Divine protection of wind...

974
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:01,500
[yells]

975
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:04,333
How wonderful. I can see you're
loved dearly by this world.

976
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:06,333
I truly envy you.

977
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:20,166
The old man and the
girl have fallen,

978
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,542
yet you remain frozen
over there on the floor.

979
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,667
I take it you've given up?

980
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:27,875
Dammit...

981
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,333
There we go,
you finally stood up.

982
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:33,625
'Course, it's less fun
since you took so long.

983
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:35,542
But still, not bad.

984
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:46,333
[yells]

985
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:48,875
[ELSA] It's no use.
I see you're a novice.

986
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:51,417
You've no divine
protections or techniques.

987
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,542
I'd hoped to squeeze wisdom out
of you, but you lack that, too.

988
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,667
[SUBARU]
Shut up! I do have my pride!

989
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,125
I can't believe you...

990
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,875
After you've put me
through all this...

991
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,875
I do acknowledge that you have
extraordinary determination.

992
00:46:03,959 --> 00:46:06,000
If only you could've stood up
and done that sooner,

993
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:08,875
things might have gone a bit
differently for these two.

994
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:21,375
I think it's time to
end this little game.

995
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:23,792
I'll send you to
meet the angels.

996
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:43,083
[ELSA]
Ah, you're full of surprises.

997
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:45,291
I certainly felt that one.

998
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:53,667
Didn't feel it?

999
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,583
I managed to open up
that belly of yours

1000
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:57,166
when we passed by one another.

1001
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,041
The one thing I excel
at when using a blade.

1002
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:07,083
[ELSA]
Just as I thought.

1003
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:09,667
Your entrails have such an
interesting shape to them,

1004
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,667
and such a lovely color, too!

1005
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,500
[SUBARU]
It hurts... It hurts...

1006
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:15,083
It hurts... It hurts...

1007
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,083
[ELSA] Does it hurt?
Are you suffering?

1008
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:18,750
[SUBARU]
It... doesn't hurt?

1009
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:19,917
[ELSA]
Do you want to die?

1010
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,333
[SUBARU]
Die?

1011
00:47:21,417 --> 00:47:23,166
Am I dead? Am I still alive?

1012
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,041
When will I die?
When will I die? When?!

1013
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,291
I'm scared... I'm scared...

1014
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:32,000
I'm scared! I'm scared!
I'm scared! I'm scared!

1015
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,417
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna
die! I'm gonna die!

1016
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,583
[ELSA] Yes, you're slowly
losing body heat...

1017
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:41,333
You're slowly growing cold...

1018
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:44,291
[SUBARU]
Oh... I'm dead.

1019
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,417
[KADOMON]
What's the matter, boy?

1020
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,667
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

1021
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,959
Say somethin'. Are you okay?

1022
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:54,875
[sighs]

1023
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:57,208
I have no idea.

1024
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,166
That woke you up.
You feelin' better?

1025
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,625
Just forget about the money.

1026
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:10,125
Here, I'll give you
these. Take 'em.

1027
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:21,041
Hey. Wait up...

1028
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:24,041
Hang on! Please, wait for me!

1029
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:27,875
Wait up! Satella!

1030
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,542
[SUBARU]
Please don't ignore me!

1031
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:34,333
My disappearing and not doing
what you said were my fault!

1032
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:38,000
But I was desperate! I didn't
know what else I could do!

1033
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,542
So I went back to the
loot house after that,

1034
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:42,792
but I still couldn't find you...

1035
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,834
I'm sorry for only
thinking of myself.

1036
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:51,417
But I'm glad you're
all right, Satella.

1037
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:55,291
What in the world
is wrong with you?

1038
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:56,625
Huh?

1039
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,583
Now, listen, I don't know
who you think you are,

1040
00:48:58,667 --> 00:49:00,875
but don't ever call me by the
name of the Witch of Envy!

1041
00:49:00,959 --> 00:49:02,667
What were you thinking?!

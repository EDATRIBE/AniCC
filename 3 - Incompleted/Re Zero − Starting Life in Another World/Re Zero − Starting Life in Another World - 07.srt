I can make your death

Why...? Why are you doing this?

Look, might be a clichÃ© to ask,

00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,250
but I gotta know.

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,208
It's simply the rule of maids.

00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,166
"If someone's suspicious,
punish them."

8
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,291
Tell me, does Ram know, too?

9
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,625
I intend to finish
this before my sister

00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,000
sees anything.

Is that...

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,875
Is that how little
you trusted me?

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,208
Yes.

And I was so sure that
we were getting along well...

I ask you this...

00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,000
Are you a faction

And under what conditions?

00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,250

Are you affiliated
with the Witch's Cult?

The Witch's Cult?

44
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,250
I don't know what that is.

45
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,542
My family's been secular

Someone associated with the one

audacity to boldly encroach

she and I belong...

I should take a moment

You mean Puck and Emilia?

148

Since you were acting
so strange earlier,

00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,667
I believe they suspect
that I did something to you

woke up, I suppose.

should I apologize to you,

I can't leave until I correct
that preposterous notion.

Not only do you look gloomy,

but that disgusting scent I
noticed before is heavier now!

00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,625
Huh?

Wait a second...

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,709
You mean the Witch of Envy?

Well, of course I do!

168
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,792
What else in this world
would somebody mean

169
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,166
when they bring up a witch?

170
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,375
What are you talking about?

171
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,250
Why do you smell her on me?

00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,667
Meh...? I don't know.

173
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,959
Regardless, as someone who
receives special attention

174
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,291
from her, you're a burden.

175
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,917
It's not comforting
to hear I'm getting

special treatment from
someone I've never even met.

177
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,625
If you have nothing
to say, I'm leaving.

178
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,375
I'll tell Bubby everything
that you told me,

179
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,291
I suppose.

180
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,417

00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,083
You feel sorry for what
you did to me, right?

183
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,375
[BEATRICE]
I do not.

184
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,959
[SUBARU]
I'm telling Puck!

185
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,542
Well, I might feel just
a teeny-tiny bit sorry,

186
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,500
I suppose.

187
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,417
If you regret what you did
and want my forgiveness,

188
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,333
do me the one favor
that I ask of you.

189
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,417
[BEATRICE]
Fine, let's hear it.

190
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,250
I'm not sure what's happening,

191
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,333
but I want you to keep me safe.

192
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:54,709
Until the fifth morning comes,
the day after tomorrow.

193
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,709
[BEATRICE] I don't want
you bringing dissension

194
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,917
into this mansion, I suppose.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,792
For various reasons, this place
is vitally important to me.

196
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,083
[SUBARU] I have no intention
of doing anything.

197
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,333
I just want to stop
any sparks from flying.

198
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,458
What an admirable
motive for one who leaves

199
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:13,000
even something like that
in the hands of others.

200
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,250
Strangely enough, for once,
I have no response to that.

201
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,375
[BEATRICE sighs]

202
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,709
[BEATRICE]
Hold out your hand.

203
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,709
I have decided that
I shall grant your wish.

204
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:36,000
I, Beatrice, on my honor,

205
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,041
am henceforth bound
by this contract.

206
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,000
[BEATRICE] Temporary or not,
a contract must be upheld.

207
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,041
I will grant you the nonsense
favor you requested.

208
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,291
Come on, seriously?

209
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,625
I'm gonna cry
because of a little girl?

210
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,458
Don't you ever
call me a little girl!

211
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,291
And if you tell Bubby, you're
gonna regret it, I suppose!

212
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,959
Hmph!

213
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,458
Is it really that
important to you?

214
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:04,500
That desperation of yours
is demonically inspired.

215
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:21,083
[SUBARU panting]

216
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,792
[SUBARU]
No! Stop!

217
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,667
[SUBARU panting]

218
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,375
[BEATRICE] Come on. You can't
keep sleeping forever,

219
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,542
I suppose.

220
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,000
[SUBARU grunts]

221
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,500
[SUBARU]
Oh, that hurt!

222
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,750
I came against my will because
it's the designated time,

223
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,041
yet you seem
awfully unconcerned.

224
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,291
Did I really fall
asleep on the fourth day?

225
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,333
What kind of reckless
idiot am I?

226
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,333
[BEATRICE]
Quit your grumbling, I suppose.

227
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,917
Sit wherever you want,
but do it quietly.

228
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,083
The forbidden archive?

229
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,500
Did you carry me in here
while I was asleep?

230
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,625
Given the option, I'd rather
not stay in that room

231
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,500
filled with your
stench, I suppose.

232
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,166
The forbidden library
is the only place for me.

233
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,291
Now, observe proper
manners, I suppose.

234
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,625
Hey, Beatrice.

235
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:26,500
I'm sure I'm wrong,
but you didn't hold my hand

236
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,917
while I was asleep, did you?

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,583
You are absolutely wrong.

238
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:33,000
Even if Bubby asked me to,
I would still refuse, I suppose.

239
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,083
Flat-out denial, huh?

240
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,959
I'm not sure what you
mean by "proper manners."

241
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,208
So, hey, are you--

242
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,667
[BEATRICE] You're annoying
me with all your questions!

243
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,041
Just be still
and quiet, I suppose.

244
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,667
They're calling...

245
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,834
[SUBARU]
Huh?

246
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,542
[BEATRICE]
I've been summoned, I suppose.

247
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:11,458
[SUBARU gasps]

248
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,709
Oh... That's right,
you're here.

249
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:14,834
I forgot, I suppose.

250
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,333
[SUBARU]
H-Hey, hold on!

251
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,750
If you go out there now...

252
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:20,041
[BEATRICE] Guess it's fine
if you want to stay.

253
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,083
You'll be safe here, I suppose.

254
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,208
[SUBARU grunts]

255
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,667
Damn it, come on!

256
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,125
What the hell is this?

257
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,417
[door opens]

258
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,667
[SUBARU]
The sun...?

259
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,834
Did I... make it through
the fourth night?

260
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,917
[chuckles]

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,166
And I figured that doing
so was next to impossible.

262
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,333
In the end,
it was that easy...

263
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:02,583
[chuckling]

264
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:05,917
[EMILIA]
Subaru?

265
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,709
[SUBARU]
Emilia...

266
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,875
There you are.
Where have you been?

267
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,709
[SUBARU]
Oh, I was just... uh...

268
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,166
You know...

269
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,000
No. Never mind.

270
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,125
Here. Come with me.

271
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:16,917
[SUBARU]
Huh?

272
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,250
Where are we going?

273
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,834
Uh, Mee-Lee...

274
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,834
Why are you making that face?

275
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,208
Everything's gonna
be just fine now.

276
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,125
I mean, look.

277
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,458
I'm still alive, right?

278
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,333
And you're...

279
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:29,542
Oh, I know!

280
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,291
Let's go to the village!

281
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,917
There's so much I want
to do and tell you about!

282
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,458
So much has happened!

283
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,542
[EMILIA]
Subaru...

284
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,917
Wait, what's the matter?

285
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:46,959
[RAM screaming]

286
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,875
[RAM crying]

287
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,917
[crying continues]

288
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,500
[SUBARU]
But, how...?

289
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,667
Why...? Why is Rem dead?

290
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,125
[RAM crying]

291
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,542
[SUBARU grunts]

292
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,583
Don't you touch her!

293
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,834
Don't touch Rem...

294
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:23,041
Keep your hands
off my little sister!

295
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,417
It appears that she
died of weakness.

296
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,625
It was as if she
just fell asleep.

297
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,000
The method was more
of a curse than a spell.

298
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,834
[SUBARU] I thought it was
Rem who used that curse.

299
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,083
So she isn't the shaman?

300
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,917
[ROSWAAL] My dear guest,
have you any idea

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,208
what might have happened here?

302
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,291
After this has happened to
a dear member of my staff,

303
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,417
I seem to be a tiny
bit angry, you see...

304
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,625
[EMILIA]
Subaru...

305
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,125
If you know anything,
then please tell us.

306
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,375
[SUBARU] I just want to spill
it all and get it off my chest.

307
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,583

308
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,291
[SUBARU yells]

309
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,583
[RAM] If you know something,
you'd better tell me!

310
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:27,792
I'm warning you!

311
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,458
[SUBARU]
Wait, Ram! That's a--!

312
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,041
I always uphold
my end of promises.

313
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,500
As long as he continues
to remain in this mansion,

314
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,125
I am contracted to
protect him, I suppose.

315
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,667
B-But, Miss Beatrice...!

316
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,959
Roswaal, he spent last night
in the forbidden library.

317
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,000
So surely, he couldn't have
had anything to do with--

318
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,542
There's no further
need to emphasize

319
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,458
the situation at hand.

320
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,041
However, Beatrice...

321
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,166
If you agreed to guard
him with your life,

322
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,125
you must have taken
quite a liking to him.

323
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,333
Save the jokes for your
makeup and weird fetishes,

324
00:15:58,417 --> 00:15:59,458
I suppose.

[RAM gasps]

326
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,583
Stop it...

327
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,375
None of that even matters!

328
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,750
Get out of the way!

329
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:12,166
Let me through!

330
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,667
I must avenge Rem.

331
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,291
If you know anything,
then you have to tell me.

332
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,458
Help me. Help Rem!

333
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,875
Say something!

335
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,291
I'm sorry, Ram.

336
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,917
Despite all this,
I'm choosing to trust him.

337
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,375
Subaru, please.

338
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,750
If you can save Ram...

339
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,750
If you can save Rem,
I beg you...

340
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,250
Please do so.

341
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,208
I'm sorry.

346

I ran.

As fast as I could.

348
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,458
I ran away from them.

350
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,208
[SUBARU]
I can't go back there again.

351
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,417
What choice did I
have back there?!

352
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,917
What could I have...

353
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,166
And I was... having
so much fun with them!

355
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,667
[SUBARU] This looks like
the place where I died.

356
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,125
Is this it?

357
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:49,291
[SUBARU] If I die, will I be
saved from this whole situation?

358
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,625
Of course...

359
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:54,083
If I do, everything will change.

360
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:58,250
If I struggled and fought
so much only to end up here,

361
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,709
then what's the point?

362
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,750
[SUBARU]
The cliff...

363
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,041
[SUBARU] If I close my
eyes and take one step,

364
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,375
it'll all be over.

365
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,583
[SUBARU]
What will happen to me...

366
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,083
...if I die again?

367
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,291
[SUBARU]
It's just one more step...

368
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,625
I can't even...

369
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:42,583
...do something
as simple as that...

370
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,583
[BEATRICE]
I finally found you.

371
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,333
[SUBARU]
Why...

372
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,375
What's the matter, I suppose?

373
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,709
Why did you come
out here for me?

374
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:02,583
Didn't I...

375
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,875
How quickly you forget.

376
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:07,750
The contract I entered
into was to protect you.

377
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:09,583
You're still my bodyguard?

378
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,125
I thought you were
only supposed to do that

379
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,709
until this morning...

380
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:15,625
In that case, you must
be mistaken, I suppose.

381
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:18,542
I don't remember discussing
there being a time limit.

382
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,917
Clinging to faint hope just
serves your own convenience,

383
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,583
I suppose.

384
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:27,166
What was lost
can't be reclaimed.

385
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,333
You'll have no more
chances to explain yourself

386
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:30,792
to the older sister.

387
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,500
That opportunity
has come and gone.

388
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,875
No matter which is lost,

389
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:37,917
they'll never be
complete again, I suppose.

390
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,083
[SUBARU]
But...

391
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,000
I really cared about
those two very much,

392
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,250
and I wanted to do whatever
I could to protect them...

393
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,333
[BEATRICE]
Why...?

394
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,417
What do you know
about them, I suppose?

395
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,375
Either way,
they'll never be restored

396
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,417
to what they once were.

397
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,750
They can't be.

398
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,041
So, in the end...

399
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,041
What I was really doing
was making a selfish,

400
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,041
disgraceful fuss without
actually knowing

401
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,375
anything at all.

402
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,709
[BEATRICE]
At the very least,

403
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,542
you need to die
where I can't see you,

404
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,625
or I'll just have
bad dreams, I suppose.

405
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:10,834
So I'll do what I can to help
you escape this territory.

406
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,166
[SUBARU]
Come to think of it, back then,

407
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,750
somebody was holding
both of my hands...

408
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,458
[SUBARU]
Ram... Rem...

409
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:41,041
If they couldn't bear to see me
suffering and in pain...

410
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,875
And they held both my hands...

411
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,583
If that's the kind
of people they are,

412
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,166
how can I leave them?

413
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,750
[RAM]
I'm going to kill you!

414
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,625
[SUBARU] I heard a voice
filled with hatred.

415
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:57,333
But more than that...

416
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,667
[RAM screams]

417
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,291
[SUBARU]
Her cries were haunting.

418
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,875
They won't leave my mind.

419
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,875
[SUBARU] All my life,
I've always been the type

420
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,792
to drift toward whichever
path was easiest.

421
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,542
[SUBARU] Hey, Subaru,
you're thinking of something

422
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,208
pretty stupid here.

423
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,834
And after all I that went
through to save this life...

424
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,166
That's right.

425
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,458
I simply saved
my own life, so then...

426
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,208
[SUBARU] What's wrong with
taking the path that's easiest

427
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,125
that will let me live longer?

428
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,333
I'll decide...

429
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,166
...how I use my life!

430
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,917
Afraid you were a bit too slow.

431
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,792
I finally found you.

432
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,250
I'm not gonna let you get away.

433
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,792
[BEATRICE]
Stay back, I suppose.

434
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,458
So long as my contract exists,

435
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,375
I won't hold back,
not even against you.

436
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,917
And you, Miss Beatrice,

437
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,875
you seem to have forgotten
we're not in the mansion now.

438
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,709
We're in the forest,
away from the forbidden library.

439
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,000
Are you so certain that
you'll be able to protect him

440
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,083
from me?

441
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,875
[SUBARU chuckling]

442
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,125
Oh, yeah, that feels good!

443
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,750
[BEATRICE panting]

444
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,166
What are you doing,
you buffoon?!

445
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,875
Do you want to die
or something?!

446
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,583
'Course not, don't be dumb.

447
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,625
That isn't what I want at all.

448
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:31,083
I only wanna die once,

449
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,500
at the end of a long
and happy life.

450
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,083
That's how I really feel.

451
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,542
You've got guts.

452
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,041
So you finally accept your fate?

453
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,333
That's not a very
accurate description.

454
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:46,458
If anything, I would say that
now I've made up my mind.

455
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,792
Sorry. I caused a lot
of grief for you guys

456
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,792
by being such a pathetic loser.

457
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,917
[RAM] So you do know
something about Rem!

458
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,583
Nope. Sorry, but I honestly
don't know a thing.

459
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,667
Frankly, there's
too much I don't know.

460
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,250
Even so...

461
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,875
I decided to learn
more about the things

462
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:06,625
I don't understand,
and to not be in the dark.

463
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:08,625
How can you possibly say that?!

464
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:10,500
My sister, Rem, is already dead!

465
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,458
What can you do by
learning anything now?!

466
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,041
It's way too late for that!

467
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,375
I won't make any cool statements
about what I'll be able to do.

468
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:20,542
After all, this is what happened
when I couldn't do anything.

469
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,333
I know better than
anyone that my words

470
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,375
aren't convincing in the least.

471
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,417
But I do remember.

472
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,458
I know parts of you two
that you've forgotten!

473
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,709
What are you saying?!

474
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,792
What is it you think you
know about Rem and me?!

475
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,000
Don't get me wrong.

476
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,417
'Cause in the grand
scheme of things,

477
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,417
what I know
doesn't really matter.

478
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,667
But it does to me!

479
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,583
And you have no idea
what it is, do you?!

480
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:42,792
Tell me!

481
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,333
I care! For all of you!

482
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,709
Every one of you
means the world to me!

483
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,750
[SUBARU growls]

484
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:53,792
Wait!

485
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,875
This is something only I can do!

486
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:28,834
[RAM]
I'm going to kill you!

487
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:33,834
[SUBARU]
I'm going to save you!

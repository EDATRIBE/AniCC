1
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:22,333
That familiar ceiling again...

2
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:23,709
[REM]
Sister, Sister.

3
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:26,333
It would appear that our
guest is still half-asleep.

4
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:27,333
[RAM]
Rem, Rem.

5
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:28,834
For one who's so young in age,

6
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,917
it's quite sad how
out of it he is.

7
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,125
[REM]
What's wrong, sir?

8
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,166
Do you feel unwell?

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,166
Is there pain?

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,375
[RAM]
What's wrong, sir?

11
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,500
Do you have a chronic
illness flaring up?

12
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,917
[SUBARU]
Let me see your hands.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
[REM, RAM]
Uh...

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,875
[SUBARU]
Ah...

15
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,041
So it's true, then...

16
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,458
Thought so.

17
00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:59,458
I'm glad I wasn't mistaken.

18
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:00,875
[REM]
No, sir.

19
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,792
I think you are definitely
mistaken about everything.

20
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,125
No sir, not at all.

21
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,417
I honestly think your
very birth was a mistake.

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,917
[SUBARU] When I think
about what's coming,

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,500
that comment's kinda
hard to laugh off...

24
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,417
But right now,
even that's a good feeling.

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,583
Sister, Sister.

26
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,959
Could our guest
be a troubled man

27
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,792
who takes pleasure from torture?

28
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:17,917
Rem, Rem.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,208
Our guest appears
to be a big pervert

30
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,250
who's somehow
turned on by insults.

31
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,375
Sorry to do that
out of the blue,

32
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,291
but I trust you both,
so it's all good.

33
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,709
Let's be friends, okay?

34
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,083
[EMILIA]
It was awfully noisy,

35
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,542
so I thought I should check.

36
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,959
I'm glad to see you're
feeling better, Subaru.

37
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,250
There was a whole lot on my mind

38
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,458
just a few seconds ago,
but seeing you

39
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,166
blew it all away, Mee-Lee!

40
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,875
I guess you were the
miracle wonder drug

41
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,375
that my heart needed.

42
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,125
Sorry, but I have no idea
what you're saying.

43
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,083
Good morning, though.

44
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,458
I'm glad you're up and about.

45
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,709
Good morning to you.

46
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:54,291
Okay, then. Guess I might
as well get started.

47
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,125
All right, I want you
to hire me on

48
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,291
to work in this place!

49
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,417
[SUBARU] There are two broad
conditions I need to clear

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,041
in order to survive a week
in Roswaal's mansion.

51
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,709
The first one is to earn
the trust of the staff here.

52
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:42,917
If I don't gain the
favor of those two girls,

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,208
they're likely to kill
me to keep me silent.

54
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:48,667
The "winning them over"
plan goes not only

55
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,542
for Rem and Ram,
but for their master,

56
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,667
Roswaal, as well.

57
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,792
And the second one
is to defeat the shaman

58
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,333
that attacks his mansion.

59
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,959
Let's do this.

60
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,875
I'm exhausted...

61
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,125
You're quite the hard
worker, aren't ya?!

62
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,500
[SUBARU]
I'm not done yet.

63
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,709
I still need to prepare
dinner and clean the rooms.

64
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,125
I'll just take a quick break,
then get back to work.

65
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,166
It's your first day,
and you're so pumped up.

66
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,834
I'm only tryin' to do my part.

67
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,542
Besides, some important
things are at stake here.

68
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,208
By the way, exactly
what kind of magic

69
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,959
does Mee-Lee use, anyway?

70
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,542
Technically speaking,
Lia doesn't really use magic.

71
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,583
And for that matter,

72
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,959
her contract with me
doesn't, either.

73
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,750
She's a spirit arts user.

74
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:37,792
You mean magic users
and spirit arts users

75
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:38,917
are different?

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,083
Magic users are
able to cast magic

77
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,709
by using their own mana.

78
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,709
On the other hand,
spirit arts users are able

79
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,083
to draw their power from
mana in the atmosphere.

80
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,500
And just what makes
those two different,

81
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,792
Professor Puck?

82
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,208
[PUCK] Basically, it depends
on whether or not

83
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,291
you use a gate.

84
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,458
[SUBARU]
A gate?

85
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:54,792
Exactly!

86
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,959
Mana passes through a gate
that's within your body.

87
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,250
You draw mana in as
well as expel it out

88
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,500
through that gate.

89
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,583
[SUBARU] I see.
So it's like a faucet for MP.

90
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,375
You should have
one, too, Subaru.

91
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,709
Whoa, really?!

92
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,834
So you're saying that I
can also use magic, then?

93
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:12,917
Want me to figure out what
your magical attribute is?

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,542
Magic users are divided
into four categories:

95
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,959
Fire, water, wind, and earth.

96
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,041
[PUCK]
Meow meow meow..

97
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,125
[SUBARU] That's a totally
magic sound effect!

98
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,917
[PUCK] I now know
what your attribute is.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,625
Yes! I can't wait for this!

100
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,250
Is it the fire of passion?

101
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,750
Or a relaxed,
cool-guy water type?

102
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,291
A gentle wind blowing
across the plain?

103
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,083
Or possibly the solid,
reliable earth?

104
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:35,959
[PUCK]
It's shadow.

105
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,250
Are you serious?!

106
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,208
Wow, you got shadow?
That's quite a rare one.

107
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,792
[SUBARU]
So, what is "shadow," anyway?

108
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,083
Must be a category error!

109
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,792
Weren't there
only four attributes?

110
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,458
[PUCK] In addition
to the four basic ones,

111
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:49,125
there're two bonus categories:
shadow and light.

112
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,083
I bet it's something amazing!

113
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,834
A talent that comes along
once in 5,000 years!

114
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:56,291
With the shadow
magic attribute,

115
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,083
you can obstruct an
opponent's vision,

116
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,000
block sound, slow down
their movements,

117
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,458
and other things like that.

118
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,166
[SUBARU]
It's just debuffs?!

119
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,750
An easy one would be
something like Shamac.

120
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:06,792
[EMILIA]
Of course...

121
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,583
That's a blinding spell,
isn't it?

122
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:09,709
[PUCK]
Hmm!

123
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,083
Would you like me to show you?

124
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,875
--[SUBARU] For real?! Yeah!
--[EMILIA] Wait, Puck!

125
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,291
And Shamac!

126
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,000
[SUBARU gasps]

127
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,959
[choking]

128
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,375
[grunting]

129
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,792
[PUCK]
Okay, that's it.

130
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:32,333
[PUCK]
So what'd you think?

131
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,709
Pretty cool, huh?

132
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,208
[EMILIA]
Are you all right?

133
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,834
Yeah! I'm totally fine!

134
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,375
It's not too flashy,
but it seems pretty effective!

135
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,083
So you're saying that I can use
this Shamac thing, too, right?

136
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,333
Well, that all depends
on your training.

137
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,208
Do you wanna try
the beginner's course?

138
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,041
Very much so! Please, Master!

139
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,834
[PUCK] I'll be here to act as
support and use the mana

140
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,208
inside you so the
magic will be coming

141
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,667
from your own gate.

142
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,333
Lia, in case Subaru's
magic goes out of control

143
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,208
and explodes,
you should step away

144
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,500
so your clothes don't get messy.

145
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,000
That's a really long way away!

146
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,333
You don't think I'm gonna
mess up that bad, do you?!

147
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:11,458
Not if you're relaxed enough
to make those kinda comments.

148
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,083
Now, let's begin...

149
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,834
Visualize the flow of
mana through your body,

150
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:18,834
then expel a part of it out
of your body through your gate.

151
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:20,041
Got it?

152
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,709
Visualizing I can do.

153
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,625
I fantasize like a champ.

154
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,542
Meow meow meow...

155
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,166
Meow meow...

156
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,166
What the--?
Well, that's not good.

157
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,208
Looks like the gate just...

158
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,709
[SUBARU yelling]

159
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:42,834
Long story short,

160
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,500
you don't have very good
control over your gate,

161
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,166
so I suggest you
shouldn't try too hard.

162
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,500
[SUBARU] You're the one
who said I'd be fine.

163
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,500
[PUCK chuckles]

164
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,917
That's so not cute.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,250
[PUCK]
Well, for better or for worse,

166
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,834
it doesn't seem like your
gate is very well used.

167
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:57,542
That would explain
why the mana inside

168
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,333
ignored the user's will and
simply burst its way out.

169
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:02,333
What am I?
Some kinda soy sauce bottle

170
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,208
w-with a loose cap?

171
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,667
You shouldn't move.

172
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,458
That little experiment used
up all the mana in your body.

173
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,834
You might not be able
to work anymore today...

174
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,166
[SUBARU]
No! I have to!

175
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,125
Don't try to overdo it!

176
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,333
This is exactly when
I need to overdo it!

177
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,417
I can't waste a single day!

178
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,917
Goodness, you
really are hopeless.

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,083
Take this.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
[SUBARU]
What--

181
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,208
Chew it up.

182
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,041
[SUBARU]
Hm?

183
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,375
Chew it up and swallow it.

184
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,417
Ready? Go!

185
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,583
[SUBARU yelling]

186
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:36,458
Whoa.

187
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,375
What did I just eat?

188
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,834
A little something
called a "bocco fruit."

189
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:43,667
When you eat one of these,
the mana in your body activates,

190
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,291
and then your gate regains
some of its strength back.

191
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,291
Sorry.

192
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,125
I guess I've caused you
some trouble, haven't I?

193
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,583
I don't think you
understand, Subaru.

194
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,125
[SUBARU]
Huh?

195
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,291
It's infinitely more satisfying
to hear a single "thank you"

196
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,041
than to be subjected
to a barrage of

197
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,875
"sorry" after "sorry."

198
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,709
I did it because
I wanted to help you,

199
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:06,333
not because I was
looking for an apology.

200
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:07,542
Okay?

201
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,583
So, given what you've
seen of our new guest

202
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,208
and everything he can do so far,

203
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,000
what do you think
of him, dear Ram?

204
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,583
[RAM] In terms of abilities,
he's completely incompetent,

205
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:24,166
but he can be excessively
quick-witted when it counts.

206
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,583
I believe it may be necessary
to keep an eye on him

207
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,166
for a time.

208
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,875
[ROSWAAL] This is a problem we
must handle with the utmost care

209
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,417
and caution.

210
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,917
And I ask that you be sure
to give the proper warnings

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,750
to your sister so that
she doesn't act rashly.

212
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,583
[SUBARU] I guess that's
about all I can expect

213
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,083
of the first day.

214
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,917
I earned quite a bit of trust
from Ram and Rem, I think.

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,375
Way to go.

216
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,834
But the bigger problem here
is that shaman's attack...

217
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,709
How do I go about fighting that?

218
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,709
[BEATRICE] You want to know
more about shamans, I suppose?

219
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:57,959
Yeah.

220
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,959
Like, "how do you avoid
curses," for instance.

221
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,875
There is no way to do so.

222
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,375
[SUBARU]
Huh?

223
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,583
It's impossible to undo a
curse once it's been activated,

224
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,125
I suppose.

225
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,834
Once they've begun, that's it.

226
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,667
That's what curses are.

227
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,959
It's possible to nullify
instant death resistances?

228
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,291
However, before
they're activated,

229
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,291
curses are nothing more
than simple spells,

230
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,875
so I can easily undo them.

231
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,375
[sniffs]

232
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,583
That is the witch's scent...

233
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,375
You know,
Rem mentioned that, too.

234
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,750
Who is this witch?

235
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,667
Are all of these witches
related to shamans

236
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,834
in any way?

237
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,917
In this world, when one
says the word "witch,"

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,709
they're really just referring
to one person in particular.

239
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,166
The Witch of Envy, right?

240
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,291
Exactly.

241
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,291
The Witch of Envy, Satella.

242
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,333
Long ago, she devoured
the six witches

243
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,125
who bore the names
of the deadly sins,

244
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,834
and drained half the world dry.

245
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,166
She's pretty much the worst
of the worst, I suppose.

246
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,959
The story goes that
she was starved for love.

247
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,291
It's said that she doesn't
understand human language.

248
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,917
It's also been said that her
body never withers from age,

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,333
weakens from sickness, or dies.

250
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,917
And although she was sealed
by the powers of a dragon,

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,291
a hero, and a sage,

252
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,333
they were still never
able to destroy her flesh.

253
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:13,750
It's said

254
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:16,625
that her body is that of a
half-elf with silver hair.

255
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,625
[EMILIA]
It's...

256
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:22,834
...Satella.

257
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,250
[SUBARU] What would it take
to make somebody steal

258
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,750
the Witch of Envy's name?

259
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,542
Hang on, I guess "steal"
makes the person

260
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,792
sound bad...

261
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,458
Maybe I should say
to make somebody "borrow"

262
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,250
the Witch of Envy's
name instead.

263
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,291
Either way, they must
have no fear of death,

264
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,625
I suppose.

265
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,709
One who would steal the
name of the Witch of Envy

266
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,792
can be called
nothing but insane.

267
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,291
I see...

268
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,959
--So that's why.
--[BEATRICE] Huh?

269
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,750
She wouldn't have to be involved
in this royal selection mess

270
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,917
if everyone just saw her
as some kind of crazy freak.

271
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,583
What are you talking about?

272
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,417
Nothing at all,
don't worry about it.

273
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,291
[SUBARU]
Good morning!

274
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,959
It's another sunny day,
perfect for drying laundry!

275
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,166
Let's make this a day
filled with happiness!

276
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,625
Make this a day of victory!

277
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,125
[SUBARU]
Victory!

278
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,208
You're so energetic
again this morning.

279
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,417
[SUBARU]
Yep!

280
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,792
Even as I'm ordered
around and disciplined

281
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,041
by the maid sisters,
I'll enjoy my life of servitude

282
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,750
to the fullest once again!

283
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,291
But when that lifestyle
wears me out,

284
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,458
and you know it will, I'll come
rest my head in your lap.

285
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,291
So save it for me, okay?

286
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,500
When you wash
your face that way,

287
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,083
you really look like a cat!

288
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,500
So, do spirits get
sleepy and worn out?

289
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,333
Do they ever oversleep?

290
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,083
[PUCK] Yeah, don't you
people get sleepy

291
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,792
when you're fatigued, too?

292
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,041
Spirits can go through
something that's similar

293
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,667
when their mana... is depleted.

294
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,000
[EMILIA yawns]

295
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,750
Did you two
stay up all night?

296
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,166
I bet you were up late talking
about who you like, right?

297
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,917
That's it, isn't it?
Come on, let me in on the fun!

298
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,583
Huh? So who do I like?

299
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,333
Well, uh...
It's embarrassing to say, but...

300
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,709
The one that
I like is Puck,

301
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,709
and the one that
Puck likes is me.

302
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,333
There. Conversation's over.

303
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:02,375
It's mutual?!

304
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,041
Then where do I fit in?!

305
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,417
Nowhere.

306
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,709
Lia is head-over-heels
for my charms.

307
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,709
It's not like you're
a bad guy or anything,

308
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,875
but compared to me,
you've got nothing to offer.

309
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:12,959
Gah!

310
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,291
You should give up
on Lia and just--

311
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,291
[SUBARU, PUCK yell]

312
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,125
Don't get carried away,
you two.

313
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,792
I'm going to get mad if
you keep up this foolishness!

314
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,125
Sorry! Sorry!
Didn't mean to make you mad!

315
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,625
[SUBARU]
Whoopsie!

316
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:26,208
I'd better get going, or the
maid sisters will be angry!

317
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,250
Bye!

318
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,208
[PUCK]
Hey, what's wrong?

319
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,792
You don't look very happy.

320
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,917
I just feel...

321
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,208
...sort of uneasy.

322
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,125
I don't think
I can explain it...

323
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,917
[PUCK] Well, I can't exactly
blame you for being confused.

324
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,458
'Cause this has gotten
to be kind of a problem.

325
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:48,000
Hey, don't worry!

326
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,959
Forget about it!
Everything's fine!

327
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,208
What do you mean, "problem"?

328
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,583
Just relax, okay?

329
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,125
I'll clean this up so fast,
no one will get hurt!

330
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,458
See? Already done!

331
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:56,750
What I'm saying is...

332
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,792
Subaru's mind is mixed up.

333
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,166
The inside and outside
are all jumbled.

334
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,834
I think that attitude of
yours is quite admirable,

335
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:06,250
but you were the one
who knocked it over

336
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,709
in the first place.

337
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,667
I'll go find a replacement--

338
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,875
No, that's okay!

339
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,083
Let me take care of
the vase and flowers!

340
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,208
I insist!

341
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,208
You can just keep
doing your own work!

342
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,041
[PUCK] If he keeps this
state of confusion going,

343
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,041
he'll wear himself
out before long.

344
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,250
[SUBARU sighs]

345
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,041
It feels pretty
great to finish a job,

346
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,417
huh, Rem-Rem?

347
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,458
It was work that you created
and then took care of

348
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,500
on your own, though.

349
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,083
When did you learn
where the vases are kept?

350
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,417
[REM]
Did my sister...

351
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,375
That's right!

352
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,917
Your sister told me!

353
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,875
Since she knows me and
how much of a klutz I am,

354
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,166
she said, "You're bound to
break a vase eventually.

355
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,834
I'll tell you where
the extra vases are

356
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,625
so you'll always be prepared."

--[REM] Subaru...

358
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,625
Whoops!

359
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,542
I totally forgot about some work
that Ram asked me to do!

360
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,250
Would you excuse me for a bit?
I can take care of it quick.

361
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,875
See you later!
I'll come find you soon!

362
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,208
[SUBARU]
I feel sick...

363
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,208
[chopping]

364
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,458
Don't you think
my knife technique

365
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,625
has come a long way
in just one day?

366
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,291
I think my talent has
finally awakened!

367
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,041
[SUBARU]
I feel sick. I feel sick.

368
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,542
[SUBARU] Rem-Rem,
check out my aptitude

369
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,917
that makes such
amazing crafting possible!

370
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,083
There must be a miracle
residing in my fingertips

371
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:16,834
right now!

372
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,250
Illusion!

373
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,125
[SUBARU] I feel sick...
I feel sick... I feel sick...

374
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,166
I feel sick... I feel sick...

375
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,375
Honestly, Mee-Lee!

376
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,208
Every time we meet,
you stir up my heart!

377
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,583
You're such a sinful girl!

378
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,000
You're guilty, I tell ya!

379
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,917
[SUBARU] I should be
able to laugh better.

380
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,500
I should be able to make
them laugh better.

381
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,083
I can't fail this time.

382
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,125
I can't waste a single second.

383
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,041
I have to throw all
my strength into my work

384
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,542
and produce some
kind of results, or...

385
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,500
Oh, Ram!

386
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,709
I wasn't slacking!

387
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,625
I'll finish up all my work!
Just you wait!

388
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,291
Now, why don't you go
kick back in your room

389
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,250
and take a well-earned
siesta while I--

390
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,500
[SUBARU vomiting]

391
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,291
[SUBARU]
Damn, I look so lame...

392
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,458
I don't have time to
spend whining like this.

393
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:04,959
You idiot.

394
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,458
Subaru...

395
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,250
Mee-Lee!

396
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,041
Subaru, come with me.

397
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,583
Uh-oh! A personal
invitation? From Mee-Lee?

398
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,959
This is moving so fast!

399
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,959
How joyous!
How embarrassing! How rare!

400
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,959
Say anything!
Tell me to do anything!

401
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,375
For you, I'd dive
into fire, water,

402
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,542
the loot house, anywhere!

403
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,959
Listen to me.

404
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,125
Hey, come on!

405
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,583
The Mee-Lee I know
would never be so cold.

406
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,333
Wait! Are you
some kind of fake?!

407
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:31,834
No way, that's impossible!

408
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,792
How could anyone else be capable
of looking so gorgeous

409
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,834
that when I see her,
all I want to do is hug her?

410
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:37,166
All right.

411
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,792
Subaru, you heard me.

412
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:39,750
[SUBARU]
Wha--?

413
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,208
[EMILIA]
Let's go.

414
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,166
Now, sit down right here.

415
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,291
Can't I sit on
the bed or a chair?

416
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,959
Why does it have
to be the floor?

417
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,250
[EMILIA]
Just sit down!

418
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,375
With pleasure! Right away!
Yes, ma'am!

419
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,709
[EMILIA]
Only this once. All right?

420
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,750
Huh?

421
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,667
[EMILIA]
Your position is a little weird.

422
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,750
And... it tickles a bit...

423
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,875
I can rest in your lap?

424
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,208
Don't say that out loud,
it's embarrassing!

425
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,709
And no looking up here.

426
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:20,917
Face the wall...

427
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,417
Close your eyes.

428
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,625
You're even more adorable when
you're embarrassed, but...

429
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,375
Why did you suddenly
let me do this, anyway?

430
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,166
I mean, when did I do
something worthy enough

431
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,959
to earn a reward this awesome?

432
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,542
Enough of that weird tough act.

433
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,333
You don't need to
do that right now.

434
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:39,000
Isn't this what you wanted...?

435
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,667
Didn't you tell me
to lend you my lap

436
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,875
when you were exhausted?

437
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:46,875
I can't do this all the time,
but today is special.

438
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:49,333
Hey, it's only my second day
of working here.

439
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,291
If I'm already
completely worn out,

440
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,417
what kind of weakling am I?

441
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,208
It's plain to see
that you're overwhelmed

442
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,959
about something.

443
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:01,083
But you're not going to tell me
what's really going on, are you?

444
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,917
I don't know if doing
this will make things

445
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,125
any easier for you.

446
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,000
But if it helps at all,
I'm happy to.

447
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,500
[chuckles]

448
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,208
Mee-Lee, come on, now...

449
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,834
You don't have to...

450
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,291
Are you tired?

451
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,166
[SUBARU]
No. I'm totally fine.

452
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,291
Really.

453
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,875
Do you feel troubled?

454
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,166
[SUBARU]
If you're this nice to me,

455
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,834
I'm gonna fall
in love with you...

456
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:23,750
When you...

457
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:26,875
I mean... like that...

458
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:30,208
It's been rough, hasn't it?

459
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,500
[SUBARU]
Yeah... It was rough.

460
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,291
And it was so painful.

461
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,375
I was just so terrified.

462
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,500
I was so sad, it hurt.

463
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,083
It hurt so much,
I thought I'd die.

464
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,000
I tried so hard, and I...

465
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,959
I couldn't get
things to work out!

466
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,041
I was so desperate
to set things right.

467
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,208
So desperate to make
everything turn out okay!

468
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,834
It's the truth!

469
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:06,959
I've honestly never tried
so hard to do anything

470
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,583
in my entire life!

471
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,375
Yes, I know.

472
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:15,875
Because I loved
this place so much.

473
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,291
Because it was
so important to me.

474
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,000
I was so scared.

475
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,375
I just...

476
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,583
I was so desperate to set
everything right again!

477
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:28,542
I didn't want those eyes
looking at me like that.

478
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,041
It was so completely terrifying!

479
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,000
And I hated myself so much.

480
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,208
[crying]

481
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,041
So much for feeling that way...

482
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:41,333
[crying]

483
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,667
[REM]
Subaru?

484
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,792
[EMILIA]
Shh.

485
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,417
[REM]
Is he just asleep, or...?

486
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,875
[EMILIA]
Yes.

487
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,959
[chuckles]

488
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,208
He looks like a child,
doesn't he?

489
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,166
A little bit, but he
definitely looks like

490
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,750
he can't do any more work today.

491
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,000
You're right there.

492
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,125
Think he's done for the day.

493
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,291
What a bad boy,
taking all this time off

494
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,792
on his second day working here.

495
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,000
When he feels better,
you can punish him then.

496
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,041
When I see him like this,
I almost don't want to.

497
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,792
[REM] I'll go inform
my sister that Subaru

498
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,000
will be useless for today.

499
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,792
--[EMILIA] Rem...
--[REM] Huh?

500
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,792
Subaru is a good boy.

501
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,792
[SUBARU]
No... Please...!

502
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,875
Did I really just bawl
all over the girl I love

503
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,667
and fall asleep with tears
and snot all over my face?!

504
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,500
Oh, man, I'm so ashamed!

505
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,709
I'm totally hopeless!
What a loser!

506
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,000
You burst in here late at night,

507
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,959
and that's what you say,
I suppose?

508
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,458
[SUBARU] Don't say that, Beako!
We're tight, aren't we? [whines]

509
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:59,333
What kind of relationship
do you think we--

510
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:00,500
Wait a sec.

511
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,333
What did you just call me?!

512
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:03,792
Oh, "Beako"?

513
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,667
Well, I think pet names
are indispensable

514
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,667
when it comes to showing
affection to others.

515
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,166
So I've decided that's
what I'm gonna call you.

516
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,625
It's the best proof of my
affection that I can give.

517
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:13,750
What do you think?

518
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,750
What a ridiculous
display of goodwill!

519
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:18,208
That isn't just disgusting;
it's revolting!

520
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,375
Hmph!

521
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,000
[SUBARU] Come on,
don't be so cold, Beako.

522
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,166
The thing is...

523
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,041
I'm really backed into a corner.

524
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,709
I need your help
with those curses,

525
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:29,917
to be honest with you.

526
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,375
Told you curses can't be undone

527
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,250
once they're activated,
I suppose.

528
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,583
That's right, I remember.

529
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,417
But would it be possible
for you to detect them

530
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,583
before they've been
activated instead?

531
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,500
I am capable of
discovering curses

532
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,375
before that happens, I suppose.

533
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,166
[SUBARU] So... how are
they placed, anyway?

534
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,041
There is one rule
of casting curses

535
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,166
that cannot be broken,
I suppose.

536
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,959
A rule that can't be broken?

537
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,667
Physical contact with
the target of the curse.

538
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,625
That is the single prerequisite.

539
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,375
So far, the only
people I've touched

540
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,417
other than the ones in this
mansion are the villagers

541
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,667
at the base of the mountain.

542
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,542
I was cursed in the village,

543
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,875
and then it activated
in the mansion that night,

544
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,458
and after that I died?

545
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,750
That would explain
why the shaman

546
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,166
was able to get Rem
the last time around.

547
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,583
I didn't go to the village,

548
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,458
so she ended up
being the target.

549
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:21,667
Yes, that fits.

550
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,625
Everything fits now!

551
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,959
I've finally found a lead!

552
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,083
Hell yeah!

553
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,792
Is that any attitude
to take toward someone

554
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,709
you asked for help, I suppose?

555
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,458
If my insight was
beneficial to you,

556
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,583
I think there's something
you should say.

557
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,542
Wait, of course! That's right!

558
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,583
Thanks for your help!

559
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,834
I can finally
see the light! Yes!

560
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:43,917
--Beako, I love you!
--[BEATRICE] Enough--

561
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,667
Put me down, now!

562
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,834
[SUBARU]
Dorowazu!

563
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,834
And so, in summary,
a lot's happened,

564
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:56,083
but today is a fresh start!
I'm a new me!

565
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,250
The lap pillow, right?

566
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,625
Definitely the lap pillow...

567
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:00,542
[SUBARU]
Huh?

568
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,041
Wait, you guys knew?!

569
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,583
Good morning, Subaru.

570
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,792
Oh! Mee-Lee!

571
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,208
Uh, well...

572
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,500
This is a little
embarrassing, but...

573
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,125
Are you feeling okay today?

574
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,250
I wasn't completely sure
until I heard your voice

575
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,542
just then, but...

576
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,041
Yes, I'm okay now.

577
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,542
So, um, Listen, Mee-Lee...

578
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,208
I'm sorry about what hap--

579
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:31,041
No. I mean, thanks
for everything.

580
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:37,083
Of course.
You're most welcome, Subaru.

581
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,583
[REM] Well, are you
ready to get started

582
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,875
on this morning's work?

583
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:43,417
We need to begin our
list of morning duties.

584
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Before all that, I have
a favor to ask of you...

585
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,500
[REM]
Lap pillow, right?

586
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,542
It's a lap pillow.

587
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,375
[SUBARU]
I'm not that much of a perv!

588
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,542
Actually, I want
to go to the village.

589
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,083
It's not far, right?

590
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,834
Do we have any plans to
go shopping for anything?

591
00:23:56,917 --> 00:24:00,041
Actually, if I recall correctly,
we are low on seasonings,

592
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,500
so I was thinking of going
to the village tomorrow.

593
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,333
Then why don't we
just go today instead?

594
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:07,375
I mean, if we're running low, it
never hurts to restock sooner!

595
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,375
I don't see a problem
with that at all.

596
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,792
Are you sure, Sister?

597
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,125
You do need to go shopping,

598
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,125
and we have no urgent
duties right now.

599
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:19,083
Plus, you have Barusu
to carry your packages.

600
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,208
[REM] All right,
if you say so, Sister.

601
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,959
Yes!

602
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,709
However, I'm coming
along with you.

603
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:28,208
You'll have a pretty
flower on each arm, Barusu.

604
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:29,250
Huh?

605
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,709
Uh, I'm just hoping...

606
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:33,000
...those flowers
aren't poisonous...

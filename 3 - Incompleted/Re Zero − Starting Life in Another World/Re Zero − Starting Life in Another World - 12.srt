Good! And finally...

00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:16,458

Victory!

All right! Line up, everyone!

[KIDS laughing]

7
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,625
It's time to
collect your stamps!

8
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,500
Okay, then, who's first?

9
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,417
The kitty's so cute!

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,542
The kitty's awesome!

11
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,125
The kitty's so sad!

12
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,750
[EMILIA] The villagers seem to
be happy and full of life again.

13
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:40,166
Thanks to you, Subaru.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,375
[SUBARU chuckles]

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,208
Well, what can I say, you know?

16
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,041
I mean I did kinda
put my neck on the line

17
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,291
to rescue them.

18
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,333
I went into the forest
and got bitten by dogs

19
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:49,542
to save the kids...

20
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,333
I got bitten by dogs
when I tried to save Rem

21
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:52,834
after she turned into a demon,

22
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:54,208
then I had to be
saved by Roswaal

23
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,500
when I was about to be
bitten by a giant dog...

24
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,083
Wait.

25
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,417
Did I really even do
that much of anything?

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,750
You're obsessing too much
over trivial details.

27
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:04,917
Stop worrying!

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,166
There are those
who know the truth

29
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,709
about what you went through.

30
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,750
That includes Roswaal and Ram...

31
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,500
And especially Rem.

32
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:12,834
And, don't forget...

33
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:15,208
I know everything that
you went through, as well.

34
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,750
[SUBARU]
A dragon-drawn carriage?

35
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,417
[WILHELM]
Welcome home, my lady.

36
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,375
I offer my most humble apologies

37
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,709
for parking in front
of your mansion.

38
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:26,750
[SUBARU]
Hm?

39
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:36,625
[RAM] An emissary from the
capital is here visiting us.

40
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:39,125
Lord Roswaal is
attending to them now.

41
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,125
Please join him, Miss Emilia.

42
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,583
An emissary?

43
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,166
I believe it concerns
the royal selection.

44
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:48,834
All right.

45
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,917
I know this is important,
so I'll be on my best behavior.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,166
I know I'm a goof, but...

47
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,208
Well, uh, sorry,
but this is really important.

48
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,125
I think it would be best if
you remained behind, okay?

49
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,709
[SUBARU chuckles]

50
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,834
Aren't you bored
waiting out here

51
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,375
all by yourself?

52
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,709
It tastes lovely.

53
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,500
Drinking it feels as
though I'm indulging

54
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,041
in a great luxury.

55
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,792
To be honest, it's the most
expensive tea in the mansion.

56
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,291
If the pink-haired
maid discovers

57
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,625
that we drank it
without permission,

58
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,166
she'll totally freak.

59
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,417
[WILHELM]
I see...

60
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,542
And what exactly
is it you hope to gain

61
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,375
from this old man using
such precious bait?

62
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,959
I only wanna know the reason
for this visit, that's all.

63
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,750
If you could maybe just
give me a vague idea...

64
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,625
As I'm unsure as to
what your standing

65
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,208
or status is in this mansion,

66
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,500
it's in my best interest not
to say anything careless

67
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,917
about our dealings here.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,166
Please understand.

69
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,250
[SUBARU groans]

70
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,542
That being said, however,

71
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,667
I did notice that you
seem to be quite close

72
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,959
to Miss Emilia.

73
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, yeah?!

74
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,166
Did it look like
things were serious

75
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,417
between Mee-Lee and me?!

76
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,166
[giggling]

77
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,208
"Mee-Lee"?

78
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,792
A steep path you're
choosing to climb...

79
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,458
Need I remind you
that you're dealing with

80
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:10,125
one who may be the
future queen of Lugunica?

81
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,709
"Future" is the key word there.

82
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,291
Right now, we're just
a super cute girl

83
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,875
and a useless servant boy.

84
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,917
You probably think your
wife is the prettiest girl

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,458
in the whole wide world,
am I right?

86
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:20,083
I mean, isn't that what
you thought the day

87
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,917
that you got down on one
knee and proposed to her?

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,166
My wife, huh?

89
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,917
Why, yes, of course.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,542
Indeed, you're
absolutely correct.

91
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,750
I believed my wife was
the most beautiful lady

92
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,375
in the entire world.

93
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,375
[FELIX]
I'm back, Old Man Wil!

94
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,959
Sorry to make
you wait outside.

95
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,709
I bet you were bored, huh?

96
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:39,750
Not at all.

97
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,333
In fact, I've been
passing the time

98
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,083
having a rather
interesting discussion

99
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,542
with this young man here.

100
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,083
Hm-mew?

101
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,458
Hm-mew mew... huh?

102
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,208
Hm-mew.

103
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,542
Ah, nyow I see.
Of course, of course!

104
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,125
You must be the boy
that Miss Emilia

105
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,542
was talking about earlier.

106
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,959
She mentioned me?

107
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,125
Wow, looks like you're
totally clueless, aren't you?

108
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,542
Let's go, Old Man Wil.

109
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,291
See you in the capital.

110
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,417
Listen, we're not going
there for fun, okay?

111
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,875
I received an important
summons that--

112
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,667
[SUBARU] If it's important,
all the more reason!

113
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,417
You're in a battle
for the throne, right?

114
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,083
I wanna be there and help
you in any way that I can!

115
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,208
Pretty please!

116
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,125
Based on prior discussions,

117
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,208
it seems there are several
people in the capital

118
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,667
who helped Subaru.

119
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,375
This may be a good opportunity
for him to thank them.

120
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,667
Very nice assist, Rem!

121
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,000
She's right, you know!

122
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,458
Some people in the capital
were a big help to me.

123
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,625
So, I need to let them
know that I'm alive and well.

124
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,417
Ooh, why not let him?

125
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,125
That can be kept separate from
our royal selection business.

126
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,583
Subaru should go to the
capital to thank everyone,

127
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,250
as well as receive treatment.

128
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,750
This trip would be an
opportunity for both.

129
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,500
Huh? Treatment?

130
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,750
You overused your
already-exhausted gate

131
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,125
in the mabeast battle
out in the forest.

132
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,834
Your wound will need treatment.

133
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,875
I believe that you met
the emissary earlier,

134
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,166
did you not?

135
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,250
Do you mean the cutesy-face
with the cat ears?

136
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,917
That "cutesy-face with cat ears"

137
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,917
was one of the capital's most
brilliant users of water magic,

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,875
as well as healing magic.

139
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,959
Felix is a peculiar one, whose
cooperation was difficult

140
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,667
even for Miss Emilia to enlist.

141
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,458
Wait a minute!

142
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:15,875
Is he for real, Mee-Lee?

143
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,041
You did that for me?

144
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,709
[EMILIA]
W-Well, it's partly my fault

145
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:19,917
that you haven't healed yet.

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,667
So you could say
I'm repaying a debt.

147
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,542
I consider this as
equal compensation

148
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,792
for what you went
through to help!

149
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,625
I just wanna
make things right!

150
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,750
[FELIX] I must admit, I was
surprised to see you talking

151
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,250
with that boy.

152
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,291
I always thought you'd
rather chop people in half

153
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,542
than talk to them.

154
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,500
That's a grave misunderstanding.

155
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,000
I merely took a bit of a
liking to what I saw there

156
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,500
in that young man's eyes.

157
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,542
[FELIX]
Hm?

158
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:45,917
[WILHELM] Those are the
eyes of one who has been

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,542
at death's door... many times.

160
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,625
[FELIX]
Huh...

161
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,417
Nyow you've lost me.

162
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,000
Either way...

163
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,583
If Wilhelm van Astrea,
the Sword Demon,

164
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,125
says something like that,

165
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,458
then I'm sure the boy faces
quite a bumpy road ahead.

166
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,667
[SUBARU]
Hey, uh... Mee-Lee...

167
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,291
Maybe we should
stop doing this...?

168
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,291
No way! Absolutely not!

169
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,875
'Cause I know how
your mind works.

170
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,083
The first moment I look away,

171
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,917
you'll be off doing
something crazy.

172
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,458
Oh, man! I can't believe
we're doing this!

173
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,083
I'm seriously moved!

174
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm totally living out
a fantasy right now, baby!

175
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,834
Subaru is so cute.

176
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,875
Parallel worlds rule!

177
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,542
[yelling]

178
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,750
[EMILIA]
Subaru!

179
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,250
Look, I'm really
sorry about all that...

00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,750
But this chaperoning makes
me feel like I'm a little kid!

181
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,041
Yet on our "date"
in the village,

182
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,458
you were the one who
wanted to hold hands

183
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:39,709
so desperately.

184
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,041
[SUBARU] Because I was
physically and mentally

185
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,417
prepared for it then.

186
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,125
This time, I'm not!
My hand is sweating like crazy!

187
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,375
[KADOMON]
Come on!

188
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,041
Would you two cut out
the flirting already?

189
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,709
All that nonsense
is gonna drive away

190
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,250
my customers.

191
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,417
After I came to make
good on my promise to you?

192
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,792
That's pretty cold, man.

193
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,333
Just giving you a hard time.

194
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,625
I appreciate you felt
obligated to shop here

195
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,542
now that you're
not broke anymore.

196
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,917
Here you go!
The appas I promised.

197
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,959
[SUBARU] Next will be
Felt and Old Man Rom.

198
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,500
[EMILIA] I assumed we'd
wrapped everything up

199
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,542
rather neatly without
blame the first time.

200
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,750
But, then, right at the end...

201
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,583
Reinhart's expression went dark
and he took the girl away.

202
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,917
When you say it like that,
it sounds like kidnapping,

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,041
or an abduction
and confinement...

204
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,125
Hot guys have
really got it good.

205
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,792
[EMILIA] If we want
to contact Reinhard...

206
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,792
...then we should probably
go to the guard station

207
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,750
that's in front of the
noblemen's district.

208
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,083
Uh, hey, Mee-Lee...

209
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,959
I wanted to ask you
about the royal selection

210
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,834
--that starts up tomorrow...
--[EMILIA] Don't start, Subaru.

211
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,083
We discussed this thoroughly

212
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,583
before going on
this trip together

213
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:37,959
and I thought you understood.

214
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,041
I brought you out here
to fulfill your promises

215
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,333
and to get you healed.

216
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,542
You don't have to
worry about me, okay?

217
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,500
[JULIUS]
Well, if it isn't Miss Emilia.

218
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,458
Good to see you again.

219
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,250
I hope that you've been
well since we last met?

220
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,583
Yes, everything's
basically the same.

221
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,792
And you also seem well, Julius.

222
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,458
[JULIUS] The mere fact
that you remember me

223
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,750
is an honor.

224
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,208
And I must say,

225
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,750
you have only grown more
beautiful, Miss Emilia.

226
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,291
[SUBARU yelling]

227
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,333
You're very kind.

228
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:17,208
Forgive me for
asking so abruptly,

229
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,333
but I have business here,

230
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,792
and I'd like you
to act as my agent

231
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,959
while I'm in the castle.

232
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,125
Is that so?

233
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,083
Does your business involve
this young man?

234
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:30,041
Heh. His attitude is
ill-matched with his attire.

235
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,375
That's no way
to conduct yourself

236
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,667
before one you've just met...

237
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,667
Thanks a bunch for the warning!

238
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,542
And while we're on the subject,
I've got a warning for you, too.

239
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,667
You shouldn't eat
curry udon in that suit.

240
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,417
If the soup splatters, the
stains will really stand out.

241
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,000
I have no idea what
this "curry udon" is

242
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,000
but I'll certainly
keep that in mind.

243
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:53,125
Now, allow me to show you
to the conference mirrors.

244
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,542
So what's he talking about?

245
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,291
They're a type of
metia that allows you

246
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,500
to have a discussion with
someone through two mirrors

247
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,709
facing each other.

248
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,875
[SUBARU]
Ah. Cool magic stuff?

249
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,625
--Well, then...
--[EMILIA] Subaru, wait here.

250
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,667
[SUBARU]
Huh?

251
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,458
I don't think it would
be a pleasant experience

252
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:09,709
for you.

253
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,041
[SUBARU] Oh, I've already
had an experience

254
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,542
that wasn't pleasant.

255
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,500
That bastard,
taking your cute little hand

256
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,250
and licking all
over it like a dog.

257
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,875
I'll try to come back
before things run too long.

258
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,834
Be good, please.

259
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,375
Stay here, okay?

260
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,375
Jeez, I look so
pathetic right now.

261
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,041
Bold thing to do in front
of the guard station...

262
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,834
"It's darkest at the foot
of the lighthouse," I guess.

263
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,125
You little...

264
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,625
[CHIN]
Don't screw around with us!

265
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,583
[KAN] You wouldn't want
us to mess up that pretty face

266
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:43,875
of yours, would ya?

267
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,750
Don't make such a racket,
you commoners.

268
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:49,125
Fools with no character
at all pick fights

269
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,625
for the most absurd reasons.

270
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,375
[SUBARU] Hey, honey!
Sorry I'm late!

271
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,792
It looks like there's
been a bit of trouble

272
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,625
in my absence,
but remember who I am

273
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,834
and cut me some slack. Okay?

274
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,875
Come on, let's go.

275
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,291
Get your hands off me,
you filthy pleb!

276
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,917
[SUBARU]
Cliffhanger...

277
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,709
I don't want
drooling commoners

278
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:07,792
following me around.

279
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,291
Of all the nerve...

280
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,166
[SUBARU]
Figure out what's going on here!

281
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,125
It was supposed to be
the classic scenario

282
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,625
where I save a girl
from hoodlums!

283
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,583
[SUBARU]
Wait...

284
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,000
No way.

285
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,083
Are the three of you the only
hoodlums in the capital?

286
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,375
It's the guy from behind
the shopping district.

287
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,959
The brat from the alleyway?

288
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,083
The very same!

289
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,750
So for my sake,
could you just--

290
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,333
Are you dumb? Forget it!

291
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:32,667
This just makes it three on two
instead of three on one.

292
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,667
[PRISCILLA]
Correction...

293
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,834
It isn't three on two;

294
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,583
it's more like three
on one on one.

295
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:39,041
Oh, would you be quiet
for just a second?!

296
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,291
I have no choice.

297
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,834
This is the last trick
I wanted to use, but...

298
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,000
Just so you know,
I happen to be good friends

299
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,250
with Reinhard.

300
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,000
If I call for him,
he'll come running as fast

301
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,625
as he possibly can!

302

303
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,834
[ROM] Hm? It's been a while
since I've seen you

304
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:05,125
around these parts.

305
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,208
What brings you back
to this neck of the woods?

306
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,375
Old Man Rom!

307
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:14,000
[CHIN, TON, KAN]
Damn you! We won't forget this!

308
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,250
[SUBARU sighs]

309
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,041
Thanks a lot. You saved me.

310
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,750
I seriously doubt
that either one of us

311
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,834
could've handled those
three thugs on our own.

312
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:21,917
Speak for yourself.

313
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,208
Whether either of
you had stepped in

314
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,458
to interfere or not,

315
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,500
I was never in the
least bit of danger.

316
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,667
You're kidding, right?

317
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,458
"I didn't need your
help, understand?

318
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,667
I'm a super strong,
fiery, independent woman!

319
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,667
I was doing just
fine on my own!"

320
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,625
Something like that?

321
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:35,875
No.

322
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,458
This world is designed
to operate in the way

323
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:38,709
that works best for me,

324
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,583
so I'm never
disadvantaged whatsoever.

325
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,291
Whoa. R-Really?

326
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,792
Well, I guess I shouldn't
have butted in, then.

327
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,500
Sorry to interfere.

328
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,041
Oh, by the way, boy...

329
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,667
Is there any chance ya
know where Felt went off to?

330
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,875
Wait a minute, you mean you
didn't hear about what happened?

331
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,875
Apparently, Reinhard
took her away.

332
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,333
Now, why would he do that?

333
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,125
Well, don't that beat all.

334
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,125
Had to be an Astrea, huh...

00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,417

Nah, nah, I'm just
talkin' to myself.

00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,750

cause any more trouble

You've got a pretty
messed-up fashion sense,

don't ya, Mister Helmet?

351
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:39,166
[AL] Now, that's no way
to talk to someone.

I can overlook that since
I'm a cool, good-natured man,

353
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:44,458
but some might lop off
your head for that.

354
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:46,041
Easy! Relax, Subaru.

355
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,542
I admit, when I first saw him,

356
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,750
his outfit surprised
me a little, too.

357
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,000
[AL]
Yeah, well...

358
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,709
I was surprised when
she asked for my help

359
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,709
while I was looking
for a lost child.

360
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,375
So there's that.

361
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,500
You're way too
soft-hearted and trusting.

362
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,959
Most people would
think that a guy

363
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,083
dressed like this who's
looking for a lost child

364
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,500
is gonna kidnap them.

365
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,834
[PRISCILLA]
My, my...

366
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,291
How very attentive
of you to wait

367
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,792
where you knew I would be.

368
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,875
I commend you
for your dedication, Al.

369
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,792
[SUBARU] You mean you
were the lost child?!

370
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,834
Well, what do you know!

371
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,834
It looks like we both found
just who we were lookin' for.

372
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,250
--Let's go.
--[PRISCILLA] Just a moment.

373
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,959
Would you mind telling me
what you have in that bag?

374
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,166
These are appas.

375
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,792
Haven't you ever
seen one before?

376
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,250
Please, don't make me laugh.

377
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,125
Everyone knows appas
have white flesh.

378
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,834
Well, I mean, yeah,
the insides are white, but...

379
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,834
Hang on, are you trying
to tell me you've never seen

380
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,166
an unpeeled appa?

381
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,917
Here ya go.

382
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,667
Now, don't go skipping
off after any obvious

383
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,375
bad guys again, okay?

384
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,458
[EMILIA]
Subaru...

385
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,500
That girl from before...

386
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,709
[SUBARU]
Huh?

387
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,083
I was wondering
where you happen

388
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,458
to have met her, and how.

389
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,917
Huh? What's this?

390
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,375
Are you jealous, Mee-Lee?

391
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,000
I can't believe
you're actually feeling

392
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,250
that way over me, or...?

393
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,375
[EMILIA]
Subaru...

394
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,375
Mee-Lee.

395
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,750
What's with the serious face?
It's freaking me out a little...

396
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,750
Uh, nothing.

397
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,208
If you don't know, it's fine.

398
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,458
Forget about it.

399
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,542
Oh, wow! I guess this
thing really is an appa!

400
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,083
[SUBARU] What?
I have to stay here tomorrow?!

401
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,792
Yes, of course you do.

402
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,000
That was our agreement
from the very beginning.

403
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,333
Well, that was the plan,

404
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,375
but we never got in touch
with Reinhard, right?

405
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,125
If we go to the castle
together tomorrow,

406
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,375
we might run into him...

407
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,959
There's no need.
I'll be sure to ask about Felt.

408
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,000
I really think
I should go in person to--

409
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,375
[EMILIA] This is the reason
I can't take you with me.

410
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,792
If I allow you to do so,

411
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,041
you'll just push yourself
too hard again.

412
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,750
I don't want to
let you do that.

413
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,000
Understand?

414
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,291
I hear what you're saying,
but you're the one

415
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,417
who doesn't understand!

416
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,875
If I have to push
myself to help you,

417
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,667
then I'll do it without
a second thought.

418
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,291
I've gotta at least try!

419
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,083
Absolutely not.

420
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,542
Until your body fully heals,

421
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,375
there is to be no using
magic or pushing yourself!

422
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,291
I want you to promise, okay?

423
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,625
Okay, you win. I promise you.

424
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,959
I won't use magic.

425
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,375
Either way...
Let me go with you!

426
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,750
[EMILIA] I can't bring
an outsider into this.

427
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:28,291
So please, just wait here
with Rem until it's over.

428
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,417
All right?

429
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,291
I'm asking you, Subaru.

430
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,333
Give me reason to trust you.

431
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,291
[SUBARU] I know there
are those in the capital

432
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,208
who consider Emilia an enemy.

433
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,625
That's exactly why
I have to stay close to her.

434
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,291
[REM]
What's the matter?

435
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm going to save Emilia.

436
00:15:59,083 --> 00:15:59,792
[REM]
Huh?

437
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,834
And to do that...

438
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,125
[REM]
Huh...

439
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,917
[SUBARU]
Stare...

440
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,792
Wh-What is it, Subaru?

441
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,208
It makes me feel uncomfortable
when you stare at me

442
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,625
with such imposing eyes...

443
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,000
[SUBARU]
Stare...

444
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,125
[REM sighs]

445
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,500
It's at the castle.

446
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,208
Although, most likely,
there'll be heavy security.

447
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,125
[SUBARU]
Security isn't the problem.

448
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,667
I can't stand not being involved
in Emilia's important affairs.

449
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,750
I know, but...

450
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:31,000
When it comes down to it,

451
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,709
I'm only of any use
when something happens.

452
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:37,166
I want to be with her at a time
when she may need me the most!

453
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,375
[REM] I'm going to set
about making a brand new

454
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,250
appa recipe that
I just came up with

455
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,417
this very moment.

456
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
What?

457
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,917
And this culinary
adventure requires

458
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,458
intense concentration,

459
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,250
so if someone were
to leave his room,

460
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,250
I most likely wouldn't notice.

461
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,625
[SUBARU] I'm such a scumbag
for relying on Rem all the time.

462
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,291
[SUBARU] But now the problem
is how I'm gonna get

463
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,667
into the castle.

464
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,375
[SUBARU] I guess times
like these call for...

465
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,667
...hitchhiking!

466
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,792
[AL]
You sure are lucky, bro.

467
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,542
Be grateful for
this coincidence.

468
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,000
We just happened to be
on our way to the castle, too.

469
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,792
[SUBARU]
You are? Why's that?

470
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,208
[PRISCILLA]
What do you mean?

471
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,583
Today, there's only one
reason to head to the castle.

472
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:29,417
[SUBARU]
Huh?

473
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,417
[AL]
Oh, you didn't know?

474
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,250
The young lady who's
seated before you

475
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,667
is one of the candidates
to succeed to the throne

476
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,375
of Lugunica,
Priscilla Barielle herself.

477
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,834
Whoa, seriously?

478
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,625
So why did you pick me up?

479
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:45,667
[PRISCILLA] For no other reason
than it seemed amusing.

480
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,375
A mere lark, nothing more.

481
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,667
I simply have a feeling
that taking you in there

482
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,083
will make things
a bit more interesting.

483
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,834
Why do you think that?

484
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,834
[PRISCILLA] This world
is designed to operate

485
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,917
in the way that
works best for me.

486
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,959
So with every choice I make,

487
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,417
it's a given that all
things will be in my favor.

488
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,625
In the end, it's only
a matter of choosing

489
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,041
whether something
amuses me or not.

490
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,500
[PRISCILLA] However,
if I had to name a reason

491
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,000
other than amusement...

492
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,041
[SUBARU]
Huh?

493
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,208
[MARCOS] Did you say,
"your appa handler"?

494
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,667
[PRISCILLA]
Indeed.

495
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,291
He's something of a wretched
clown whose sole priority

496
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,542
is to bring me bittersweet
appas whenever I fancy one.

497
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,583
[MARCOS]
Hmm.

498
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,709
Everyone is waiting inside.

499
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,917
So please make haste.

500
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,250
As their superior,

501
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,583
I like to keep
the masses waiting.

502
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:50,959
[EMILIA gasps]

503
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,875
Subaru?

504
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:58,959
Emilia.

505
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,834
I can explain, uh...

506
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:02,333
[PRISCILLA giggles]

507
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,792
Is there a reason you're
staring at my manservant?

508
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,625
It's rude to gawk, you half-wit.

509
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:07,667
[SUBARU]
Get off!

510
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,458
You'll give Mee-Lee
the wrong idea!

511
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:12,417
[ROSWAAL] My, how nice
to see you, Miss Priscilla!

512
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,000
I do hope you'll
forgive my servant

514
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,458
[PRISCILLA]
Hmph.

515
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,458
What in the world are
you doing here, Subaru?

516
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:27,333
Thought I told you, you were
supposed to wait for me.

517
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,291
You remember that, don't you?

518
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,458
[MARCOS]
Attention...

519
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,792
The council of wise
men will now enter.

00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,792
So that's the council
of wise men, huh?

521
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:42,917
If I remember correctly,

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,417
they're the people
managing the country

Hey.

00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,792
That's where we're
supposed to stand.

00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,458
You mean I can stand there, too?

527
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,083
Well, what do we have here?

528
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,291
I find this situation amusing,
so you may accompany him.

529
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,625
Wait, Roswaal!

530
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,333
If Subaru's allowed
to stay here,

531
00:19:58,417 --> 00:19:59,583
I'm sure that he'll--!

532
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,208
Miss Emilia,
the conference is beginning now.

533
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,709
We can't make them wait.

534
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,792
Move to the center, but
you're going to explain this

535
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,000
to me later!

536
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,250
[SUBARU]
So those are the participants

537
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,959
in the royal selection...

538
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,875
Guess one of them
will be the future ruler

539
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,125
of this country...

540
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,834
So you decided to
come after all, Subaru.

541
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,667
When I heard through the
grapevine that Miss Emilia

542
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,917
would be here, I had
a rather strong suspicion

543
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,333
that you would be here, as well.

544
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,667
Hey, Reinhard!
I've been looking for you!

545
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,041
[FELIX]
Oh, how's it goin'?

546
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:34,875
You, too?!

547
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:35,709
[FELIX]
Nyaa-haha!

548
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:36,875
[REINHARD]
Oh, Subaru...

549
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,125
You know him, I take it?

550
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,458
Huh? Know "him"?

551
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:40,667
That's right.

552
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,583
He's a knight by the
name of Felix Argyle.

553
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,083
And, despite all appearances,
he is male.

554
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,125
You're kidding!

555
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,291
What's the point
in looking like that

556
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,458
and even having cat ears
if you're a guy?!

557
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't knyow what to tell you.

558
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,750
You're the one who made
the wrong assumption,

559
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,083
silly Subaru.

560
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:00,834
[SUBARU growls]

561
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,417
Hey, Subaru,
what's the matter?

562
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,291
Where I come from,
this is the kind of face

563
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,834
you make whenever
you run into a guy

564
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,125
who's a romantic rival!

565
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,000
Now, if I may be so forward,

566
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,417
I, Marcos, leader
of the Imperial Knights,

567
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,458
will act as the director
for all of today's proceedings.

568
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,667
It all happened about
half a year ago,

569
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,625
when members
of the royal family,

570
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:22,917
starting with the king,

571
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,125
went into hiding
one by one, causing--

572
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,166
[ANASTASIA]
Listen...

573
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,542
I get that you wanna
talk things up

574
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,500
and put on a good show here...

575
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,333
But I'm kind of busy, y'know.

576
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,500
You may not have heard it,

577
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,542
but we have a saying
back in Kararagi:

578
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,959
"Time is money."

579
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,375
That attitude seems familiar,
but I can't place it.

580
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,834
[AL] Evidently, everybody
who's in western Kararagi

581
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:42,250
acts like that.

582
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,542
I couldn't agree more.

583
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,959
[MARCOS]
Miss Crusch,

584
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,000
should the head of the Karsten
family say such a thing?

585
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,625
I acknowledge it's important
to observe formality,

586
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:52,875
but it is also a fact that
our time is rather limited.

587
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,250
So, it would be wise to
immediately inform us

588
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,917
as to why we're here.

589
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,709
Naturally, however,
I do have a general idea.

590
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,667
Am I to understand
you already know

591
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,375
the purpose of
this meeting, then?

592
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,625
Yes, I do, Lord Miklotov.

593
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,041
For a drinking party.

594
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,667
One day soon,
we'll face each other as rivals,

595
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,417
but by sharing drinks and
conversing at the same table,

596
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,041
we'll have a chance to learn
more about one another.

597
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,875
No, ma'am.
That is not correct.

598
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:22,667
Felix, this is not what
you told me earlier.

599
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,208
What? That's not true!

600
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,667
All I said was, "Maybe it'll
be a drinking party."

601
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,000
I never said I knew it
for a fact or anything.

602
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:29,959
I see.

603
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,667
Then I jumped to conclusions.

604
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,000
Forgive me.

605
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,917
Please allow me to retract
everything I just said.

606
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,083
Now just a second!

607
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,417
Even if she backs down,

608
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,375
my opinion on this
isn't gonna change.

609
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,166
There's no need to explain
the royal selection process now.

610
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,792
We already know how it works.
Am I right?

611
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,041
Well...

612
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,500
Even so, I think maybe
we should hear the--

613
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,000
Sorry, but I don't
remember asking

614
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,667
for your opinion
on any of this business.

615
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,500
--Why, you little--
--[AL] Hey!

616
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,750
[AL] I-I don't know what's up
with the royal selection,

617
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,875
so I'd kinda like
to hear the rest.

618
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,208
Excuse me, but I was informed

619
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,166
that this young man is
your knight, Miss Priscilla.

620
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,333
Haven't you explained
the selection to him?

621
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,291
Whether I have or not
holds no merit.

622
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,917
You men will still ramble
on about it, won't you?

623
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,625
Please continue, Marcos.

624
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,625
As you wish.

625
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,709
There's a specific reason
we've gathered you

626
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:18,542
who are qualified to be
the dragon's priestess.

627
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:22,583
A new prophecy has been engraved
in the Dragon Stone.

628
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,250
This new insight says,

629
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,917
"From the five capable
of becoming

630
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,333
the nation's new leader,

631
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,875
choose one priestess
to enter into a covenant

632
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,500
with the dragon."

633
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,583
Wait, five?

634
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,208
[REINHARD]
That's right.

635
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,208
At the moment, there are
only four candidates

636
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,583
for the honor.

637
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,625
And the royal selection
hasn't even begun as of yet.

638
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,875
But today, history
will be set in motion.

639
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,500
[MARCOS]
Knight Reinhard van Astrea,

640
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,583
come forward.

641
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:50,667
[REINHARD]
Yes, sir.

642
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,875
[REINHARD] Honored members
of the council of wise men...

643
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:01,500
Imperial Knight,
Reinhard van Astrea,

644
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,625
would like to announce the
completion of my mission.

645
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,625
The fifth contender,
the final candidate

646
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:09,375
mentioned in the prophecy...

647
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,458
...has been located.

648
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,583
[REINHARD] The one I,
myself, revere as queen...

649
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,417
Her name...

650
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,875
...is Miss Felt!

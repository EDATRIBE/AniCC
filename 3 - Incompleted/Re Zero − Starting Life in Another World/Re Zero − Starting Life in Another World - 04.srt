1
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,583
I don't know this ceiling.

2
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,917
[SUBARU] The wound on
my stomach... it's gone.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,625
All things considered,
it must've been Emilia.

4
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:34,917
And that healing
power she has...

5
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,375
Well, at any rate,
looks like I was able

6
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,959
to get out of using Return
by Death this time around.

7
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,834
Even so, isn't it
normal to wake up

8
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:56,125
and see a girl by your bed
asking, "Are you awake?"

9
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,709
after she spent all
night caring for you

10
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,625
while you were
asleep and healing?

11
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:01,750
Kinda lame for a story
about being summoned

12
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,500
into another world...

13
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,208
[SUBARU]
A looping hallway, huh?

14
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,542
I bet I can't get out until
I find the right room.

15
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:20,125
The typical pattern dictates the
first door is likely the goal!

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,667
What a profoundly irritating

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,125
and aggravating man
you are, I suppose.

18
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,792
The first NPC found!

19
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,500
You're gonna ruin
your cute little face

20
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,291
with that cold
attitude of yours.

21
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,166
Come on, smile! Smile for me!

22
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,458
The only smile appropriate to
give you is a derisive sneer.

23
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:39,917
Are you upset because I guessed
the right door on the first try?

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,166
I've always been pretty lucky

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,583
when it comes to
stuff like that.

26
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,583
I can understand why game
masters would want me

27
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,750
to see all the cut
scenes... but sorry!

28
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,834
So what is this place, anyway?

29
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:52,166
[BEATRICE]
Betty's multi-purpose room,

30
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,542
which serves as a library
and bedroom, I suppose.

31
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,709
Man, talk about
your token response.

32
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:59,125
So are you one, uh,
those manual girls?

33
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,417
[BEATRICE] Betty has had
just about enough of you.

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,041
I think it's time to teach
you a lesson I suppose.

35
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,250
Hang on, wh-what are
you gonna do to me?

36
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,250
Stay right there, and
don't you dare move.

37
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,959
Anything you'd like to say?

38
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,166
How about, "Don't hurt me"?

39
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,375
[screams]

40
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,291
[SUBARU] What did you do to
me, you drill-haired loli?

41
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,709
Oh, nothing much.

42
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:29,000
I only collected the mana
from your body, I suppose.

43
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,208
By doing so, I've confirmed
that you are not an enemy.

44
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,875
You little freak.
You're not human, are you?

45
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,542
I mean, outside of your
sparkling personality.

46
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,583
Took you long enough
to notice, I suppose.

47
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,625
[SUBARU]
I take it back.

48
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,750
Your personality
isn't human, either.

49
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,667
[BEATRICE] Do not measure
a proud, noble being

50
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,333
such as myself by your
standards, human.

51
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,000
I know this ceiling.

52
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,291
[REM]
Oh, he has awakened, Sister.

53
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,500
[RAM]
Indeed, he's awakened, Rem.

54
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,458
Hard to believe a
total night owl like me

55
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,959
can wake up so early.

56
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,542
I'm getting all emotional.

57
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,959
I should probably go to
sleep a second time.

58
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,375
No, wait a sec.

59
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,625
I woke up earlier, so that
would make this the third.

60
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,792
[REM] My, what a deadbeat
thing to say.

61
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,250
Did you hear that, Sister?

62
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,041
[RAM] Truly the words of a
loser. I heard him, Rem.

63
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,625
Hey!

64
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,250
Who are these two voices that
keep criticizing me in stereo?!

65
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,709
N-No way...

66
00:04:56,792 --> 00:05:00,000
Short-skirted maid costumes
exist in this world, too?!

67
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,458
[SUBARU]
In my mind, maids were always

68
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:04,500
the very personification
of elegance.

69
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,583
This is gonna be awesome!

70
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,417
[REM] What terrible thoughts
this one is having.

71
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,959
You are being
repeatedly violated

72
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,458
in the mind of
our guest, Sister.

73
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:12,834
Truly terrible, indeed.

74
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:14,959
You're experiencing the
ultimate shame over and over

75
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,291
in the mind of our guest, Rem.

76
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,417
Don't underestimate the
capacity of my mind.

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,917
You're both fair prey in
my fantasies, little maids!

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,041
[knocking]

79
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,458
Seems like you can't even wake
up without causing a commotion.

80
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,000
Huh, Subaru?

81
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,125
[SUBARU] Whoever picked that
outfit definitely gets it!

82
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,750
I'm not even going
to pretend to know

83
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,542
what you're talking about,
but the fact that I know

84
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,625
it's something stupid
is disappointing.

85
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,291
Listen to this, Miss Emilia.

86
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,917
Without provocation,
my dear sister

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,417
was just violated by that man.

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,959
Please listen to
this, Miss Emilia.

89
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,458
Rem was just held prisoner
and shamed by that man.

90
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,959
That's enough, you two.
Don't tease him so much.

91
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,375
Yes, of course, Miss Emilia.
My sister is very sorry.

92
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,834
Yes, of course, Miss Emilia.
Rem's sorry, as well.

93
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:59,542
Tell me, are you
feeling all right today?

94
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,208
Does anything feel "off" to you?

95
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,375
[SUBARU]
Huh?

96
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,792
Nah. Just a bit groggy
from oversleeping.

97
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,500
So you were the one who saved
me, isn't that right, Mee-Lee?

98
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,000
Huh? "Mee-Lee"?

99
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,458
Why would you call me that?

100
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,792
Uh, it's just a
nickname, no big deal.

101
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,959
Seriously, though.
Thank you. You saved me.

102
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,291
Not at all.

103
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,291
Honestly, I'm the one who
should be thanking you.

104
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,792
You barely even know me,

105
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,625
but you still risked your life
in order to protect mine.

106
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,250
It's only natural I'd
heal your wounds

107
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,208
after something like that.

108
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,792
Well, then once again,

109
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,125
I guess it's time to go out
and start a brand new day!

110
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,834
[SUBARU]
This place is really huge.

111
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:41,667
This isn't a yard,
it's more like a field.

112
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,458
Those movements
are quite unusual.

113
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,333
What are you doing?

114
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,709
My homeland's ancient practice

115
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:48,041
of warm-up exercises
and calisthenics.

116
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,208
Come on!

117
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,375
You should try and
do 'em with me, Mee-Lee!

118
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,875
Routine number 2!

119
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,834
Bounce briskly on both feet
to loosen up your body!

120
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:57,458
Huh? You're kidding!
That's weird!

121
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,834
Just do whatever I'm doing.

122
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:03,542
I'll drill the essence of radio
calisthenics into you, okay?

123
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,458
[SUBARU]
Now, raise both your arms

124
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,041
and shout, "Victory!"

125
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,208
V-Victory!

126
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,375
[PUCK]
Victory! Victory!

127
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,125
Victory!

128
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,750
Hi there, Subaru!
Great morning, isn't it?

129
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,291
Well, to be completely honest,

130
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,917
it's been nothing
but total chaos

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,250
from the minute I woke up.

132
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,542
There were looping hallways

133
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,583
and a mean little
girl on a rampage...

134
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,959
And after that, shedding
the sweat of passion

135
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,208
with Mee-Lee.

136
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,709
There's no need to make
it sound so scandalous.

137
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,041
Good morning, Puck.

138
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,625
Really sorry I put you through
so much yesterday.

139
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,125
Morning, Lia.

140
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,625
I came really close to losing
you back there, didn't I?

141
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,208
I'll never be able to
thank Subaru enough.

142
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,291
I think I should do
something for him.

143
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,625
Yeah?

144
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:50,041
Okay, let me pet your fur
whenever I feel like it!

145
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,375
Huh? Is that seriously
all you want?

146
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,959
For a first-rate fur
master such as myself,

147
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,625
being able to love on the object
of your petting affections

148
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,792
any time you want is
worth just as much

149
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,208
as the troves of a
multimillionaire's riches!

150
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,750
[SUBARU]
Oh, man, these ears!

151
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,375
I'm so in love with how
soft and cuddly you are.

152
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,125
I know you feel that way since
I can kinda read your mind,

153
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,875
but I'm amazed you
can actually say it!

154
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,333
It's okay, Lia.

155
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,417
'Cause I can't find
any trace of hostility

156
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,834
or malice in him at all.

157
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,166
It's so cute how you
call her "Lia," too.

158
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,166
It's not half as cute as
when you call her "Mee-Lee."

159
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,583
You really are a
strange one, Subaru.

160
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:26,709
[SUBARU]
Huh?

161
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,458
Well, look at this.
What brings you two here?

162
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:36,875
[BOTH]
Miss Emilia.

163
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,542
Our lord, Master Roswaal,
has finally returned home.

164
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,542
Please come inside.

165
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,792
[BEATRICE]
I was watching you from upstairs

166
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,333
and you know what?

167
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:51,709
It would appear that you are
quite the imbecile I suppose.

168
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,000
[SUBARU] And just where do you
get off saying that, you loli?!

169
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,375
What does that word mean?

170
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,625
I've never even heard it
before and it irritates me.

171
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:58,959
I think you just made it up.

172
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,959
Betty, haven't seen
you in four days.

173
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,417
Hope you've been doin'
well and staying ladylike!

174
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,750
Hello, Bubby!

175
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,375
I've been waiting so eagerly
for you to come home!

176
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,375
Will you stay with me
today, do you suppose?

177
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,083
Yeah, sure, no problem.

178
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,583
Today's the day we can
finally relax together.

179
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,125
Aww, this'll be great!

180
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,709
Feeling bewildered, aren't you?

181
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,458
Beatrice is so taken with Puck;
she can't get enough.

182
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:24,625
I can't believe you just said
"bewildered" unironically.

183
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:28,500
[ROSWAAL] My, my! How unusual
to see you here, Beatrice!

184
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,291
I'm so happy you're
dining with me.

185
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,834
I do ever so love your company
and treasure our times together!

186
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:35,208
That boy is more than enough

187
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,500
addle-brained fool
for me, I suppose.

188
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,208
Betty was only waiting
around for Bubby!

189
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,000
[SUBARU] Wow, so you
guys hired a clown

190
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,959
to entertain you
before each meal?

191
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,083
I'll never understand
how you rich folks think.

192
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,375
U-Um, Subaru?
That man is actually--

193
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,458
Oh, no, it's quite
all right, Miss Emilia.

194
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,208
I'll handle the introductions.

195
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,709
What's going on?

196
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:57,333
I am, in fact, the lord of this
manor, Roswaal L. Mathers.

197
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,625
So very pleased to make
your acquaintance.

198
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,917
Subaru Natsuki, right?

199
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,125
This is way better
than normal food!

200
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,667
[ROSWAAL]
Mh-hm!

201
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,500
Despite her appearance, Rem's
cooking is quite impressive.

202
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,875
So this was cooked by the
one with the... blue hair?

203
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,709
I think I got that right.

204
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:21,917
You made this?

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,417
Yes, that's correct.

206
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,333
I'm responsible for all of the
cooking in this household.

207
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,083
My sister doesn't happen to
be very good at cooking.

208
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,000
Ah, so it's the old
"twins who are good

209
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,583
at different things" trope, huh?

210
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:35,125
So your sister good at
cleaning then, I take it?

211
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,417
Yes, that's correct.

212
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,375
My sister excels at
housework chores,

213
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,834
especially cleaning and laundry.

214
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,375
So while you're
good at cooking,

215
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,959
you're probably bad at cleaning
and laundry, right Rem-Rin?

216
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,333
On the contrary, I'm generally
good at all household tasks.

217
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,917
I'm also better at cleaning
and laundry than my sister.

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,709
[SUBARU] Seriously?! Does your
sister even have a purpose?!

219
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,750
You are truly a
unique young man.

220
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:58,041
You come to the mansion
of Margrave Mathers,

221
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,834
in the Kingdom of Lugunica,

222
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,417
and you say you don't
understand a thing.

223
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,667
So what do you mean by that?

224
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,000
Is something bad
happening in this country?

225
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,875
Well, it is not in
an agreeable state.

226
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,083
Which only makes sense.

227
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,834
After all, Lugunica
doesn't have a king.

228
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:17,208
Now don't look so alarmed,
there's no need to be concerned.

229
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,625
Everyone in this country
is already quite aware

230
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,959
of that circumstance
being their reality.

231
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,166
Wow, really?

232
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,166
I expected a "Now that
you know my secret,

233
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,166
I can't let you leave
here alive" thing.

234
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,709
[ROSWAAL]
Roughly around the same time

235
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,083
the king went into hiding,

236
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,917
an epidemic began to spread
throughout the castle.

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,583
The king and his children
are the last of his line.

238
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,417
At this moment, the nation
is being managed

239
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,166
by a council of wise men,

240
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,125
and that council is
currently in the process

241
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,125
of selecting a new king.

242
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,709
Okay, think I'm startin'
to get the picture now.

243
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,208
On top of the king's absence,

244
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,875
the royal selection is causing
confusion in the kingdom.

245
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,834
Suddenly, I appear
from another country--

246
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,542
Wait, I'm totally suspect here!

247
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,667
And on top of that, you made
contact with Miss Emilia,

248
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,250
thus initiating a direct
connection to my household.

249
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,583
Ahh, the dilemma.

250
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,083
Hey, hold on a second,

251
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,417
why would the lord of the
mansion call her "Miss Emilia"?

252
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,667
I'm not sure how things
are where you're from,

253
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,792
but here, we address those with
higher status resectfully.

254
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,542
But, uh, that would mean
Mee-Lee here is, uh...

255
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,750
Officially, my current title is:

256
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:21,583
Candidate for the 42nd ruler
of the Kingdom of Lugunica

257
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,834
with the backing of the
honorable Lord Margrave Roswaal.

258
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:25,875
What?!

259
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,750
Sorry to surprise you like that.

260
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,542
I wasn't trying to keep
it a secret or anything.

261
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,041
[SUBARU]
Hey, it's that insignia.

262
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,834
This qualifies one to be
a candidate for king.

263
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:39,542
It's a ceremonial touchstone
that's used to determine

264
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,208
if one is worthy to
sit at the throne

265
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,041
and lead this country
as a monarch.

266
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,041
Wait a second!

267
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,417
Are you saying you
lost an insignia

268
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,667
that qualifies you
to rule the kingdom?!

269
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,750
Now don't put it like that!
I didn't lose it!

270
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,458
It was stolen from
me by a thief!

271
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,041
That's the same thing!

272
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,583
And what happens if you manage
to lose that thing, anyway?

273
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,750
Will a government office
issue another one?

274
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,917
[ROSWAAL]
Oh, what a dreadful scenario!

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,417
If you'd lost it, then
there would be no doubt.

276
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,458
The belief would be that
one who can't even protect

277
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:07,125
a tiny insignia has no
business being entrusted

278
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,834
with the nation's rule
and that would be the end.

279
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:13,041
Well, knowing those facts,
I'd say I did a damn good job.

280
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,166
And it totally raises my
expectations for a nice reward.

281
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,792
Yeah, you're right about that.

282
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,333
You're a true savior to me
and I'm very thankful.

283
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:21,625
So ask me for anything.

284
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,500
Ah, yes, you heard the lady!

285
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,458
Any reward you desire!
Just name it!

286
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,375
[laughs]

287
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,333
[SUBARU] Well, in that case,
I have but one request.

288
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,041
I'm starting to
like this mansion.

289
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,834
Hire me to work here!

290
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,834
A-choo.

291
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,750
[EMILIA]
No, that's not quite right.

292
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:48,000
Wasn't there anything
else that fit, Subaru?

293
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,458
[SUBARU] Oddly, some of the
girls' stuff fit me, but...

294
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,625
Our deepest apologies on the
wardrobe, sir. I mean, Subaru.

295
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,917
I must say, you look
utterly ridiculous, sir.

296
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I mean, Barusu.

297
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,250
[SUBARU]
Oh, good job, Ram.

298
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,709
You just turned my name
into a blinding curse.

299
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:04,041
Rem, notice anything about
Barusu's ludicrous appearance?

300
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,709
Well, the shoulders
fit him funny,

301
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:08,208
his legs are short,
and his eyes are scary.

302
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,125
Two of those are things I can't
do anything about, okay?!

303
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,375
[RAM]
We can't allow you to work here

304
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,208
in such shoddy-looking attire.

305
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,917
People would begin to question
Lord Roswaal's dignity.

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,917
Let us alter the jacket,
at the very least.

307
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,500
Rem, if you wouldn't mind...

308
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,542
If you'll excuse me, I have to
study for the royal selection.

309
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,250
Good luck with
your work, Subaru.

310
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,250
Yep! Leave it to me, Mee-Lee!

311
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,917
[ I'll take your measurements
for the fitting.

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,583
So stand still with
your back straight.

313
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,667
[gasps]

314
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,333
Please don't make strange
noises during this process.

315
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,542
It's unpleasant for me.

316
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,667
Unpleasant for you?

317
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,041
And that was beyond my control!

318
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,250
This is awkward for
a guy, you know!

319
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,792
[RAM]
This is the VIP room.

320
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,166
This is the bathing room.

321
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,542
This is the kitchen.

322
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,125
And this is the lavatory.

323
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,208
[SUBARU]
In a mansion like this,

324
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,375
I bet the restroom
is frikkin' huge.

325
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,583
My sweet Bubby. Oh.
Aww, I love your fur.

326
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:56,792
[BEATRICE grunts]

327
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,959
Don't worry, I won't
tell a soul about this.

328
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,417
The feel of that fur
would make anyone--

329
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,834
[SUBARU yells]

330
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,625
Ow! Come on, now let me
finish, you little--!

331
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,333
You just witnessed Miss
Beatrice's Door Crossing.

332
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:10,208
Oh, really?

333
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,625
So it's a spell that can connect

334
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,917
any door in the mansion to
her own room, is that it?

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,667
And once Miss Beatrice has
eliminated her presence,

336
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,083
there's no way to find her
without trying every door.

337
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,291
She's in here!

338
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,375
[BEATRICE screams]

339
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,041
Impressive, Subaru!

340
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,125
All right, how did you
pick the right door again?

341
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,583
Look, I told you
before, remember?

342
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,166
I'm a flag crusher who
makes game masters cry.

343
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,333
[BEATRICE] I have no idea
what you're talking about!

344
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,500
[SUBARU] Tell me, how do you
fit in around here, anyway?

345
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,166
You Roswaal's little sister?

346
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,875
I would never want to be
his sister, I suppose! Hmph!

347
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,583
Betty is the librarian
who oversees

348
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,041
the Roswaal Mansion's
forbidden library.

349
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,166
[RAM] Master Roswaal is
the greatest magic user

350
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,500
in the kingdom.

351
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,458
He has many books that
mustn't be seen by others.

352
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,208
And Miss Beatrice
has been contracted

353
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,750
to protect them
from prying eyes.

354
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,166
Understand now? Then go away.

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,625
[RAM] This concludes our
tour of the mansion.

356
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,542
So do you have any questions?

357
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,959
I know it's no use saying
this after it's over,

358
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,291
but don't you think
it would've made

359
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,458
a whole lot more sense
for Mee-Lee to be the one

360
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:08,959
to take me around
for the tour event?

361
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,291
If you have no questions,

362
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,917
then let's get to the ins
and outs of your job.

363
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,333
Basically, you'll be helping
with my work, Barusu.

364
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,000
This must be the moment
when my hidden skills

365
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,166
as a butler finally
reveal themselves!

366
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,709
[RAM]
My work today consists of caring

367
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,041
for the front yard and garden,

368
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,500
helping to prepare lunch,
polishing the silver,

369
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,250
airing out the futons,
doing the laundry,

370
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,417
cleaning the bathrooms,

371
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,792
and the mansion's
monthly soot cleaning.

372
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,917
[bell tolls]

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,417
[sighs] Oh... Finally...

374
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,000
[knocking]

375
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,291
[REM] This is Rem. Do you
have a moment, Subaru?

376
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,834
Sure, yeah, I'm good.

377
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,583
I won't do anything
weird, so come on in.

378
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,166
[REM] Your permission makes
you sound less credible.

379
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,500
Pardon me...

380
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,959
You already finished
the alterations?

381
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,542
When it's Lord
Roswaal's clothing,

382
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,458
I must be careful and precise,
but since this is yours...

383
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,875
[SUBARU] Wait, you cut
corners 'cause it's me?

384
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:59,041
I hate to admit it,
but it's perfect.

385
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,959
How do I look? Good, huh?

386
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,834
With this outfit over
the bizarre attire

387
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:04,333
that you were
originally wearing,

388
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,542
no one in any strange
garment could rival you.

389
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,083
[SUBARU]
Not a compliment at all!

390
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,917
And what shall we do with those?

391
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,542
[SUBARU] This one's easy.
Got a needle and thread?

392
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,834
Yes, I brought them.

393
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:15,625
Would you like me to
repair them for you now?

394
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,792
Nah, that'll be okay.
I can do it.

395
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,959
Don't underestimate
my sewing skills.

396
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,750
I'm honestly surprised.

397
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:28,500
I must give you full
marks for your sewing.

398
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,709
I'd like to add, however,
that much like you,

399
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:34,083
it doesn't appear
useful whatsoever.

400
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,458
[SUBARU]
Ow!

401
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,083
You may get full
marks for sewing,

402
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,542
but you're still useless
with a knife, Barusu.

403
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,709
As always, you make
such a lovely image

404
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:43,291
when peeling vegetables, Sister.

405
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,375
Your bias is so blatant,
it's almost comforting!

406
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,417
I'd like a comment on my work
too if you can muster one up!

407
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,959
[REM]
How about "I pity the farmer

408
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,166
who grew those vegetables"?

409
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,375
[SUBARU]
Stop being so cruel!

410
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,709
You're breaking my heart!

411
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:56,166
You don't know how to
handle a knife, Barusu.

412
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,125
You should hold it still and
simply turn the vegetable.

413
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,208
My best dish is steamed tatoes,
if I do say so myself.

414
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,417
How can you say that

415
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,333
with such a triumphant
look on your face?!

416
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,458
Damn it, just watch!

417
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:07,875
My favorite blade,
Shooting Star,

418
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,875
will show you a thing
or two about slicing!

419
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,750
[SUBARU screaming]

420
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,333
[ROSWAAL] How has Subaru been
since he started working?

421
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,875
Five days have passed
since his arrival.

422
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:32,000
Shouldn't we be seeing
something by now?

423
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,417
[RAM] Cooking...
laundry... cleaning...

424
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,333
He's useless at all of them.

425
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,166
[ROSWAAL]
How very harsh of you.

426
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,709
And? What are the
chances he's a spy?

427
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,834
I can't deny that such
potential exists,

428
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,333
but I think the possibility
is slim, at best.

429
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,959
'Cause for better or for worse--

430
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,625
for worse, in this
case in particular--

431
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,333
he's too conspicuous.

432
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:54,250
And if he's too
conspicuous, then...

433
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,208
Well, despite the odds
of that possibility,

434
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,000
he certainly is
carefree, isn't he?

435
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,458
Personally, as I see it,

436
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:04,291
it would be wise to
interfere with things.

437
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,875
[RAM]
They're both only children.

438
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:08,792
Even if we let them be,
nothing will happen.

439
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,875
[EMILIA] It's not that
exciting to watch, is it?

440
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,875
You may think that,
but nothing's ever boring

441
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,542
when I'm hangin'
around you, Mee-Lee.

442
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,792
That's good to hear, even
if you're only flattering me.

443
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,625
Besides, the two of us haven't
had a chance to just talk

444
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:31,542
for the past few days, have we?

445
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,667
[EMILIA]
That's true.

446
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,917
Bet it must've been
difficult for you

447
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,625
to learn the work
expected of you here.

448
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:37,750
Ain't that the truth!
It's killing me!

449
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,959
I wish I could be tenderly
comforted in your arms,

450
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,709
your chest, and your
lap, in rotation.

451
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,125
If you can go around making
tasteless jokes like that,

452
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,875
you're probably fine.

453
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:53,125
Wow, the moon sure is pretty.

454
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,625
And it's up in the heavens,
far beyond our reach.

455
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,041
[SUBARU]
Well, what do you know?

456
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,458
I got a really touching
response without even trying!

457
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:01,750
On another matter,
don't you think

458
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,500
you're a bit lacking
in ambition?

459
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,291
Like that one time with Puck.

460
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,959
And in the capital, when
you asked for my name.

461
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,625
You just don't get me
at all, do you, Emilia?

462
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,709
I want what I want at
that exact moment,

463
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,458
and I want it from
the bottom of my heart.

464
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:17,333
It's self-gratification
in its purest form.

465
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,709
Huh?

466
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:22,542
Right then, I wanted to your
name more than anything.

467
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,583
I had no expectations
for tomorrow;

468
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,667
I was simply trying to
make it through the day.

469
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,959
And on top of that,
I was in a new land,

470
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,125
nervous and so uncertain
about my future.

471
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,542
Looking back on it, there
were probably other things

472
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,166
I should have wanted.

473
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,417
But I can't lie to myself
about things like that.

474
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,625
Same as the request I made to
Roz. I'm flat broke right now.

475
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,083
I could choose to cheat him out
of a fortune and live it up,

476
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,583
but I can just as easily obtain

477
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,792
an ongoing source
of livelihood, right?

478
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,875
In that case, why didn't
you simply choose

479
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,500
to become a permanent guest
rather than an employee?

480
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,458
I never thought of that!

481
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:57,542
[gasps]

482
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:01,041
Oh, man, what an idiot!

483
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,125
Talk about a
pathetic effort, huh?

484
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,458
Do you want me to
use my healing magic?

485
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,291
[SUBARU]
Nah, I'm fine like this.

486
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,125
Really? Why?

487
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,458
It's kinda for me to explain,
but... the way I see it,

488
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:16,667
this is proof of all the
effort I've been putting in.

489
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,875
I don't actually dislike
exerting myself, you know.

490
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,291
Learning to do something
I couldn't do before?

491
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:26,208
To be honest,
it's... not so bad.

492
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:30,125
Yes, I see. I would never've
thought of it that way.

493
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,959
You're such an idiot, Subaru.

494
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,583
Well, that wasn't the
reaction I was expecting.

495
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,250
Wasn't I charming?

496
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,125
You could never be.

497
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:42,375
Well, maybe just a little.

498
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,125
E.M.A...

499
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,291
Huh?

500
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,375
Oh, it's short for
"Emilia, Major Angel."

501
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,875
I was being so sincere, and now
you're joking around again?

502
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,709
Anyway, I know
you're working hard,

503
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:56,291
but how did your
hands get like that

504
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,792
just by doing some
household chores?

505
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,208
This hand I cut
with a kitchen knife.

506
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,583
And the one on the other hand

507
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,625
is from when I went to town
in the evening to shop,

508
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:07,417
and a little animal some kids
were playing with bit me.

509
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,917
It wasn't the result
of your labor efforts?

510
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,458
[SUBARU]
Those kids were ruthless,

511
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:13,875
hitting and kicking me, and
wiping their runny noses on me.

512
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,375
Gotta say, it kinda sucked.

513
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,959
You do seem like
the type of person

514
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,834
who'd be good with
small children, Subaru.

515
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,709
Hey, wait! I've got an idea!

516
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:23,083
Wanna come with me tomorrow to
get revenge on those little--

517
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,291
I mean, to watch the kids

518
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,125
and that small animal
play together?

519
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,792
It's not as if I don't want
to go out there with you...

520
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:30,959
Fine, then! Let's go!

521
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,667
But if-if I come along,

522
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,875
it might end up causing
a lot of trouble for you.

523
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,291
Okay, understood! Let's go!

524
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,792
Are you even listening to me?

525
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,083
I am, I swear!

526
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:43,667
I hang on every word
you say, Mee-Lee!

527
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,250
Fine, then.

528
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,458
But only when I'm able to take a
break from all of my studying

529
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:50,875
and your work is done
for the day, okay?

530
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,542
Yeah! All right!
This is gonna be great!

531
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:57,041
[BOTH laughing]

532
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,917
[SUBARU humming]

533
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,709
Hey, loli girl!
I see you're still up!

534
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:06,333
So now you can just casually
break through my Door Crossing

535
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,750
like it's natural, I suppose.

536
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:11,375
Well, I just wanted to say
hello before going to bed.

537
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,667
Can I try that, too?

538
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,500
[BEATRICE] Only Bubby has
permission to touch me,

539
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,709
I suppose.

540
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:18,709
Why should you get to
have all of the fun?

541
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:19,709
I'm in a good mood--

542
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:21,417
[BEATRICE]
Enough! Get out of here!

543
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,208
And that had nothing to do
with Betty, I suppose.

544
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,375
[SUBARU]
For our date tomorrow,

545
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,834
I'll have to come up
with a clever excuse

546
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,917
to ditch the kids
in the village.

547
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,291
Oh, but first, I've gotta find
out where all the good views

548
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,709
and flower fields and
other stuff are...

549
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,875
Crap! I can't sleep while
I'm thinkin' about this!

550
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,291
Oh, I know!

551
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:48,250
One Puck to pet...
Two Pucks to pet...

552
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:52,125
A hundred and one
Pucks to pet...

553
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:57,250
[SUBARU] A new dawn has
come across the land!

554
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,834
A dawn of hope!

555
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:02,208
Subaru Natsuki is going to
make giant strides today!

556
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,125
What are you two doing in here?!
This is so embarrassing!

557
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,875
You should've said something!

558
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:11,083
Sister, Sister, I do
believe that our guest

559
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,709
appears to be a bit confused.

560
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:13,667
What do you think?

561
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,458
Rem, Rem, yes I agree.

562
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,291
It looks as though our
guest has gone crazy.

563
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,000
Hey, why are you
calling me a guest?

564
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,667
You two and your
silly little jokes...

565
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,834
[SUBARU]
The wounds...

566
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:35,083
They're gone!

1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,625
[SUBARU]
And now for the final exercise!

2
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,250
Swing your arms out wide...

3
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,625
...then cross them in front
of you as you take slow,

4
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:21,750
deep breaths.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,250
I came to check on him since
break time's almost over.

6
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,542
Things are quite lively here.

7
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, big finish...

8
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,500
Victory!

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,917
[KIDS]
Victory!

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,291
[KIDS chattering, cheering]

11
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,208
[SUBARU]
All right!

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:37,917
[YOUNG MEN'S LEADER]
Yeah!

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,417
[BOTH laughing]

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,917
I feel so much
younger after that.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,959
[laughing]

16
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:52,583
[SUBARU] Okay, everyone
has touched me now.

17
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:53,917
[RAM]
Barusu...

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,917
Exactly what
sort of game is this?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,750
[SUBARU]
Radio calisthenics.

20
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:01,000
I think the fact that everyone,
young and old, can enjoy it

21
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,000
is the key secret to its many
long years of success!

22
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,291
[RAM]
Who cares?

23
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,041
[MILDO]
Ram-Ram, that was cold.

24
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,375
Ram-Ram, that was mean.

25
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,917
Ram-Ram, you're scary.

26
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,750
Did you teach all
these children to call me

27
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:14,750
by that name?

28
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,583
Well, it was more like...

29
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,458
I wanted to share
some friendliness around

30
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,291
with everybody.

31
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,875
I suppose I don't mind it.

32
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,875
What about Rem?

33
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,750
You mean Rem-Rem?

34
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,583
She's Rem-Rem.

35
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,959
Or Rem-Rem-Rem-Rem.

36
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,875
So, then. Enjoy the village
trip you wanted so much?

37
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,750
I sure did!

38
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:35,458
Nothing to worry about there.

39
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:37,458
When Muraosa patted
my shoulder at the end,

40
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:39,000
my trip was complete.

41
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:41,917
What's up?

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,875
If you wanna say something,
then just tell me.

43
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,041
Uh, take a look.

44
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,166
Over there.

45
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,417
All right, have your
way a little bit longer.

46
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,458
Well, if you say so, sister.

47
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:57,542
Yes!

48
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,458
Really appreciate it,
my dear senpais!

49
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,250
That's right,
there was an event like this.

50
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,333
I remember.

51
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:15,583
[DOG growls]

52
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,583
And this little pup
still hates me.

53
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,375
Weird, she's usually so tame.

54
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,375
She only growls
like that at Subaru.

55
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,583
What'd you do to make
her so mad at you?

56
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,166
I wish I knew
the answer to that one,

57
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,333
believe me.

58
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:27,709
If it's happened
three times,

59
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,375
I guess we're
just incompatible...

60
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,834
Oh, now's my chance!

61
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,583
If you'll excuse me...

62
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,333
[SUBARU chuckles]

63
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:38,166
There's the sensation
I've longed for!

64
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,583
You know, for a stray, your fur
feels pretty fantastic, pup!

65
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,417
Hey, you've got a
big bald spot

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,792
on top of your head.

67
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:45,792
Is it a scar?

68
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,208
What did you walk int--

69
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,875
Yow!

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,375
You even bit me in almost
the exact same spot!

71
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,291
Are you a time-traveling canine?

72
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,458
Guess you got carried away!

73
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,667
It's what you get for
touching her so much.

74
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,375
She is a girl, after all.

75
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,750
I really don't think
that's the problem here.

76
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,750
Also, isn't anybody
worried about me?

77
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,291
I was just bitten, you know.

78
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,834
[KIDS laughing]

79
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,250
Holy crap, I made it!

80
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,959
Well done, me! Good job!

81
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,792
Seriously,
really nice work there.

82
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,333
Yes, yes, job well done.

83
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,458
Yes, yes, excellent work.

84
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:20,917
[ROSWAAL] Ah, I see the
three of you are together.

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,208
Good.

86
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,917
That will save me precious
time on my way out.

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,333
[RAM, REM]
Lord Roswaal.

88
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,166
Pretty fancy clothes
you've got there.

89
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,166
Nice.

90
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,667
Thank you so much.

91
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,166
I'm getting together
with someone

92
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,083
who's absolutely dreadful
to deal with in normal attire,

93
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,208
so I had no choice but
to wear dress clothes

94
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,417
for the occasion.

95
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,709
Is it a visitor?

96
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,166
Or will you be going out?

97
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,542
Ram is correct.

98
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,125
I'll be going out.

99
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,792
I received a message
earlier today

100
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,625
that was a tad troublesome.

101
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,959
So now I'm off to make
the rounds outside.

102
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,458
There's a fairly high likelihood

103
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,417
that I won't be
back home tonight.

104
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,166
Ram, Rem, take care
of things until I return.

105
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, sir.
We will do as you command.

106
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,834
Yes, sir.
Even if it costs our lives.

107
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,250
[SUBARU]
Roswaal didn't leave the mansion

108
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,959
any of those times before...

109
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,000
I've great expectations
for you too, Subaru.

110
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,166
I want you to keep
an eye on Miss Emilia

111
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,542
and take good care of her.

112
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,917
Sure. You can definitely
count on me for that!

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,333
[ROSWAAL] Look after things
while I'm away, everyone!

114
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,542
Whoa! Roswaal can fly?!

115
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,917
[SUBARU]
Magic is incredible...

116
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,959
The difference in circumstances
from my previous experiences

117
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,875
of this day must have
been triggered by my visit

118
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,375
to the village.

119
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,625
That means my strategy
of acting as a decoy

120
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:41,333
is working as planned.

121
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,750
And that's why I'm here for
my long-awaited Beako time!

122
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,500
[BEATRICE] Your face looks
quite different than it did

123
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,709
half a day ago.

124
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,667
You've been busy, I suppose.

125
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,917
I'd love to take it easy
for a change, you know...

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,333
But I can't.

127
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,250
'Cause there's something
I want you to check out for me.

128
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,792
I think I've been cursed.

129
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,792
Could you look me over head
to toe and find out for sure?

130
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,208
[BEATRICE]
What are you talking about?

131
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,750
I think I've been cursed.

132
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,750
Could you look me over head
to toe and find out for sure?

133
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:11,583
Gah! No one asked you to
repeat yourself, I suppose!

134
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:14,041
It hasn't even been a full
day since I first told you

135
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,083
about shamans.

136
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:18,041
You're far too
impressionable for--

137
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,125
Wait just a minute...

138
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,500
You really have been
cursed, I suppose!

139
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,792
So it turns out the shaman
was one of the villagers

140
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,417
after all.

141
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,625
Think you'll be
able to figure out

142
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,125
what kind of curse it is?

143
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,333
Well, that wouldn't be possible
simply by looking at it.

144
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,667
But as I told you
a little earlier today,

145
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,917
once it's been activated,
chances are you'll die,

146
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,041
I suppose.

147
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:40,709
How strange.

148
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,041
Even after that reminder,

149
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,834
you don't seem afraid
of dying at all.

150
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:45,333
Huh? Are you out of your mind?

151
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:47,250
I'm insanely scared of dying!

152
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,917
There's nothing in the
world that freaks me out

153
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,709
more than even
thinking about it!

154
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,333
Wish people who say
"I'd rather die"

155
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:55,208
would actually die before
saying stuff like that!

156
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,000
Which is why, this time,

157
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,667
I'm determined to
find a way out...

158
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,583
...of this fate.

159
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,208
Okay, so get rid of this
curse for me, would you?

160
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,875
I'm runnin' out of time here.

161
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,709
[BEATRICE] Now, why should I
have to go through the trouble

162
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,625
of saving your life, I suppose?

163
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,417
I expected an unlovable
and cold response like that,

164
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,166
so I came fully prepared
to convince you.

165
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,709
If I die, your dearest
Puck is bound to be sad.

166
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:19,750
[BEATRICE]
Hm?

167
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,625
You think too
highly of yourself.

168
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:24,291
Bubby wouldn't be all
that disturbed if you died.

169
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,875
Oh, on the contrary!

170
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,375
If I did, then Emilia would be
at least a little bit shocked.

171
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,959
And when Emilia feels
shock like that,

172
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,542
Puck takes damage, too.

173
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,083
If you had the chance
to have stopped it,

174
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,250
but chose not to,
what would he think of you?

175
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,667
[BEATRICE whines]

176
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,667
All right! I'll go along
with your smooth talk this time!

177
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,125
But when all of this is over,

178
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,667
I won't have anything to do
with you again, I suppose.

179
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,125
Okay, but I'll always come back

180
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,208
to ask for your help
when I'm in trouble!

181
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,125

182
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,917
I'll destroy the spell that
was used in the curse now,

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,333
I suppose.

184
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,834
It's burned into you on
the exact spot on your body

185
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,625
that the shaman touched
while casting it,

186
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,208
so that'll act as our reference.

187
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,750
Yeah, I prepared for this.

188
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,041
I've got it covered.

189
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,709
[SUBARU] The young men's
leader with the short hair...

190
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,583
The old lady who
patted my butt...

191
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,000
And Muraosa,
the fake village head.

192
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:13,208
I made sure all the suspects
touched different parts of me.

193
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,834
[SUBARU]
Black mist? Creepy.

194
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:30,041
[BEATRICE] Abhorrent is
more like it, I suppose.

00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,083
[SUBARU gasps]

196
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,417
There we go. All done.

197
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,083
So relax, you'll be just
fine now, I suppose.

198
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,959
So the place that the
black mist came from...

199
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,458
That's also the spot
where the shaman

200
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,208
touched me earlier, isn't it?

201
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,166

Could that puppy actually be...

202

to the village.

203
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,291

messing with me!

The village...?

206
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,000
What for?

207
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,834
Beatrice said that the
one who gave me this wound

208
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,917
is also the one who's
responsible for placing

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,500
the curse on me.

210
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,709
And that means it was the dog
that the kids were playing with!

211
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,375
It may have looked
innocent at the time,

212
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,709
but that little beast
cursed everyone it bit!

213
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,125
If I don't do something,
they'll be in grave danger.

00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:18,875
If you don't think
you can trust me,

00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,291
you're welcome to come along.

216
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,208
But we can't just leave
Emilia defenseless here

217

all by herself.

218
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,500
And that means only
one of you can come!

219
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,000
You made up that rule.

220
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,375
And if we are to obey
Master Roswaal's orders

221
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,458
to the letter, then there's
absolutely no reason

222
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,291
for either one of us
to go with you.

223
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,875
Right, there's not.

224
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,458
Fair enough.

225
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:40,000
But do you happen to recall the
only order Roswaal gave to me?

226
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,709
Very well, Barusu.

227
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,208
I will allow you to act
on your best judgment.

228
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,333
But Sister...

229
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,250
And Rem will be
accompanying you.

230
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,333
Exactly what I wanted to hear!

That's my decision,
so please respect it

232
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,458

233
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,166
I'll confirm everything
with Miss Beatrice

234
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,375
and remain here to
protect Miss Emilia.

235
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,834
I'll be sure to keep
an eye on other things, too.

Sister, wait. You shouldn't...

237
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,542
[EMILIA]
Subaru, are you going somewhere?

238
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,375
I heard voices,
so I wanted to come down

239
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,375
and see what was going on.

240
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,583
What happened?

241
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,875
It's more like something
might be happening.

242
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,917
But, you won't need
to worry about all that.

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,417
I'll bet you're going to do
something dangerous again...

244
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,583
Interestingly enough,

up a dispute

I can't talk you
out of it, can I?

[chuckling]
I guess not, no.

249
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,208
As a matter fact,
if you tried to,

250
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,291
it'd be a hindrance
in several ways...

251
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,333
Fine, fine, it's okay, I get it.

252
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,041
I won't try to stop you.

253
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,500
It's probably no use
telling you not to be rash

254
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,000
or reckless either, right?

255
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,041
Well, that depends, I guess...

256
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,291
I mean, it isn't like I want
to do rash or reckless things.

00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,500
Go with grace.

doesn't smell like beasts to me.

353
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,291
Look! Up ahead! It's them!

354
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,917
[SUBARU] She's breathing.
They're still alive!

355
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,083
[REM] That's true.
But their breathing is shallow.

356
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,959
They're all unconscious
and weak.

357
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,208
If left alone...

358
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,208
They're weak?

359
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,458
Is it the curse?

360
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,792
And we finally found them...

361
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,959
Rem, can't you do
anything to reverse it?

362
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,875
Not a spell of this magnitude.

363
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,417
If only my sister were with us.

364
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,458
I'm sure she could do something.

365
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:19,709
I'll try what I can.

366
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,583
And cast a healing
spell to comfort them.

367
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:24,083
When they're calm, we can
carry them back with us.

368
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah, sounds good.

369
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,208
Then I'll...

370
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,667
Who am I kidding?
I'm so useless.

371
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,834
I'll keep an eye out for--

372
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,542
[PETRA]
Subaru?

373
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,250
[SUBARU]
Petra! You're awake!

374
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,500
All right, good.
You're a tough girl.

375
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,166
I need you to save
your strength, though.

376
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,500
Don't overdo it.

377
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll take you back home
where you can say goodbye

378
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,375
to the pain.

379
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,083
--Just rest up for the time--
--[PETRA] One is...

380
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,667
One is... still in... in the...

381
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,667
Hold on, what did you say?
Petra!

382
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,500
[SUBARU]
Damn it, she's right.

383
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,959
I don't see the little girl
with the braid anywhere!

384
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,375
No, please don't go!

385
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,792
It's far too dangerous.

386
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,166
And if the mabeasts took her,
it may already be...

387
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,291
Look, I understand what
you're trying to tell me.

388
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,333
I really do...

389
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,083
But you heard what Petra said.

390
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,792
She was trying to tell us the
other girl was taken away.

391
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,750
Even in her state,
she showed concern

392
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,083
for her missing friend
before asking for my help.

393
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,875
Don't you see?
She put her friend's life

394
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,709
and wellbeing before her own!

395
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,125
I want to respect
Petra's feelings.

396
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,125
If you take something on,
you should see it through

397
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,417
to the bitter end.

398
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,667
If you get too greedy,

399
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,500
then you run the risk
of taking on much more

400
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,583
than you could ever
possibly carry back with you.

401
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,917
I know.

402
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,291
But that's the reason
you came along, isn't it?

403
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,834
And what does this situation
have to do with me?

404
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:44,166
Those kids need you now.
More than they ever did before.

405
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,834
leave the children with
them and then follow me

406
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,333
out into the forest.

407
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,500
We don't know the threat
our opponent presents,

408
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,083
or when the villagers
will arrive.

409
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,709
At worst, there's always
a chance that you'll

410
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,583
wander off somewhere
and I would never be able

411
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:56,667
to find you.

412
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,125
It'll be fine.

413
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,667
'Cause I'm confident that
you won't lose track of me.

414
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,667
What makes you so sure?

415
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,959
[SUBARU]
Even if no one else does,

416
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,917
I know that you can
pick up my scent.

417
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,083
The foul odor
that hangs on me...

418
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,583
The witch's scent.

419
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,417
Isn't that right?

420
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,417
Wait, Subaru.

421
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,625
How do you know about...

422
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,250
[SUBARU]
No idea, heh.

423
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,250
There's a ton
I don't understand.

424
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,959
So much that no matter
how many times I start over,

425
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,291
I can't seem to find
the answer I'm looking for.

426
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:28,291
Just like there are many
things you want to ask me,

427
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,000
there are a ton
of things that I want

428
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,667
to ask you about, too.

429
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,291
So when all of this is
taken care of, we should talk.

430
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,166
We can chat until
our voices are hoarse!

431
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,542
It's a promise!

432
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,250
I just want you to
know I trust you, Rem.

433
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,583
And this is my attempt at
showing you can trust me, also.

434
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:50,834
So that promise I made,
I'm sticking to it!

435
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,417
All right, very well.

436
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,750
Then I promise on my end, too.

437
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,709
I plan on asking you
many questions,

438
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:57,917
so be ready for them.

439
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,291
You got it!

440
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,250
And once the villagers
arrive to help the children,

441
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,333
I'll join you.

442
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,709
Just be careful out there.

443
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,166
Don't do anything reckless.

444
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,625
Appreciate the concern,
but don't worry about a thing!

445
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,709

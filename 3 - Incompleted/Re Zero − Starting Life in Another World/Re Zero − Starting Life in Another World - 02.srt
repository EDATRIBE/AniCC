1
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,166
[GIRL]
I'll ask one more time.

2
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,250
Why did you call me by the
name of the Witch of Envy?

3
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,041
W-Well, because
you said I should.

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,333
[GIRL] I don't know
who told you that,

5
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:31,542
but they have a
terrible sense of humor!

6
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,208
The Witch of Envy is the
very definition of taboo.

7
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:37,291
And you call me by her name,
which most dare not even say?!

8
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,291
Yeah, she's right, kid!

9
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,750
You crossed the
line there, buddy!

10
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:43,208
If you don't have anything
to say, then I'm leaving.

11
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,417
I have things to do.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,250
[SUBARU]
What?

13
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,583
[chuckles]

14
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,583
That's Felt!

15
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:55,667
[gasps]

16
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,375
[gasps]

17
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,834
Wait, were you a distraction?

18
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,709
Are you working with her?!

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,208
What? No!

20
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,375
Hey! Wait a minute,
come back here!

21
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,333
You've got it all wrong!

22
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:16,959
[SUBARU]
Damn it!

23
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:59,000
Come on! Would someone please
be a little nicer to me?

24
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,917
This world sucks.

25
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,125
Why was I even summoned here?

26
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,250
[KAN] What are you
goin' on and on about?

27
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,333
If you don't wanna get hurt,

28
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:10,959
then cough up
whatever you've got!

29
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,875
[KAN, CHIN chuckle]

30
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,875
Just stop it already!

31
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,542
Nobody could be this
damn persistent!

32
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,458
[CHIN] You think you
can mouth off to us?

33
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:21,959
[SUBARU]
Now move it!

34
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,542
I have somewhere I need to
go and you guys are in my way!

35
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,709
[SUBARU grunts]

36
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:35,000
[TON]
You stabbed him?! Oh, man...

37
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,709
[SUBARU]
You've gotta be kidding...

38
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:39,458
It hurts... It hurts...

39
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,875
Hey, what are you doing?!

40
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,709
[KAN]
Well, no sense in wasting him!

41
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,041
Take anything he's
got that's worth selling!

42
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,417
[SUBARU]
Huh?

43
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,667
[TON] Whoa, wait! The guards
will be here any second!

44
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,375
[SUBARU]
But Old Man Rom ate those...

45
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,625
How...?

46
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,667
C-Could... this be...?

47
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,959
[CHIN]
C'mon, move it! Run!

48
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:16,000
Speak up! You want it?

49
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,500
Hey, mister?

50
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,709
[KADOMON]
Huh?

51
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,625
How many times have you
seen me here before?

52
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,375
What are you talkin' about?
I've never seen you before.

53
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,709
Well? Decide! You want it?

54
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,417
Sorry, but I don't have any
money at all! Totally broke!

55
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,709
[KADOMON]
Then get the hell outta here!

56
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:40,250
[SUBARU] Wallet, cell phone,
corn potage, cup of noodles...

57
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,375
It looks like my tracksuit
and sneakers are intact, too.

58
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,166
And hopefully...

59
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,583
[sighs] That's a relief.

60
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,667
'Cause a wound to the back

61
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,083
is a warrior's greatest
shame, for sure.

62
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,542
Well, with this much
circumstantial evidence,

63
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,083
there's absolutely
no denying it.

64
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,875
It's kinda hard to believe,
but this has to be...

65
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,333
...a time leap.

66
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,166
And each time, I return
to my initial state.

67
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,417
I'll call it...
"Return by Death."

68
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,959
So I have the ability to
leap backwards in time,

69
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,542
but it only
activates when I die.

70
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,250
Guess even my special power
knows what a loser I am.

71
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,625
[SUBARU] If I've gone back in
time to this moment once again,

72
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,208
then Satella hasn't helped me.

73
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,333
We haven't even met yet.

74
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,333
Consequently, that means
the debt I owed her

75
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,917
for saving me is
completely gone.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,166
That's actually a
stroke of good luck!

77
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,041
I can forget everything,
sell this, save some funds,

78
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,583
and use my knowledge
of the modern world

79
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,250
to create a paradise!

80
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,166
Things are finally lookin' up!

81
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:44,875
Huh?

82
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,333
Am I right, mister?

83
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,250
Wh-Why're you asking me?

84
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,208
I don't have any idea what
you're talkin' about, all right?

85
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,500
Come on. Don't be like that.

86
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,458
[GUY A] I don't wanna get caught
up in other people's problems.

87
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:59,625
So don't talk to me about 'em.

88
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,333
[SUBARU] Well, I guess the old
saying "Let sleeping dogs lie"

89
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:05,875
applies no matter
what world you're on.

90
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:09,333
Even so, there are
always softies...

91
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:10,542
People who'll help others,

92
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,000
even when they really
can't afford to.

93
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,208
She'd just had something
precious stolen.

94
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,542
She didn't have time for me.

95
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,041
Yet she saved some
useless stranger.

96
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,917
And even healed him.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,542
Then she let that
useless stranger

98
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,959
feel all pleased with himself.

99
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,375
[gasps]

100
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,583
[SUBARU]
Even if Satella doesn't know me,

101
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,709
that doesn't change everything.

102
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:59,709
Felt still stole her insignia,
and Elsa will...

103
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:02,917
No matter how many times I
repeat this, that won't change.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,417
History's a compelling
force, right?

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
[SUBARU]
Yeah.

106
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,500
If I'm fully aware that people I
used to know will be murdered...

107
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,625
...then I can't just ignore it!

108
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:25,959
Huh...?

109
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,667
[SUBARU]
Hey, mister...

110
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,291
What do you want now, broke boy?

111
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,500
[SUBARU] Th-There's something
I need to ask you...

112
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,333
Have there been any
pickpocketing incidents

113
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:35,375
around here?

114
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,500
Asking questions
without buyin', huh?

115
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,709
You got some nerve, kid.

116
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,750
But yeah, stuff like that
happens all the time.

117
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,834
Though, that last
one was unusual...

118
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,750
They threw some magic around
in the street a coupla times.

119
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,625
Things that looked like
icicles flew around

120
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,125
and lodged in the wall.

121
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,458
They disappeared quick, though.

122
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,000
[SUBARU]
I was too late.

123
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,041
I thought if I could keep the
insignia from being stolen,

124
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,417
then maybe things
wouldn't have...

125
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,125
What are you goin' on about?

126
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,417
Oh, it's nothing
important. But, uh...

127
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,208
Thanks, mister. Really.

128
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,625
You helped me even though I
didn't actually buy anything.

129
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,583
[KADOMON]
Ah, it's no big deal!

130
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:12,125
A broke kid a lot like yourself
just helped my daughter

131
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,834
after she got separated
from her mother earlier.

132
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:20,083
I guess fate is a compelling
force, too, huh?

133
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,625
[KADOMON]
What are you smilin' about?

134
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,208
[SUBARU]
It's nothing.

135
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,625
I'll be sure to buy an
appa next time, okay?

136
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,083
Sounds good. Buy one and
you'll be a customer.

137
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,208
Get to work, broke boy! See ya!

138
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,000
[SUBARU]
Later!

139
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,333
This means there's
only one way!

140
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:35,959
I have to buy the
insignia from Felt

141
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,458
before Elsa comes
to the loot house,

142
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,166
and return it to Satella!

143
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,417
Wait... "Satella" was just an
alias that she used, wasn't it?

144
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,834
Then I'm gonna need to do
whatever I can this time around

145
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:48,792
to make sure she tells me
what her real name actually is.

146
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you goin'
on and on about?

147
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,083
If you don't wanna get hurt,

148
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,083
then cough up
whatever you've got!

149
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,792
Listen, Dumb, Dumber,
and Dumberest,

150
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,750
I'm getting sick of
seeing your faces.

151
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,000
After doing this four times,
I've learned my lesson!

152
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,291
[ALL]
Huh?

153
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,750
Guards, help me!

154
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,792
What the hell, you bastard?!

155
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,166
[chuckles]

156
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,875
[SUBARU] It seems my memory
from before was right.

157
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,166
This world does have some
kind of police force!

158
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,125
[SUBARU]
Someone! Please, I need a man!

159
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,500
[CHIN]
Damn it, shut up!

160
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,125
[SUBARU] No, don't touch me!
Stop! I can't hear you!

161
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,208
You're not being sincere enough!
Someone, please help me!

162
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,375
Polic... Huh?

163
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,166
Don't scare me like that.

164
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,750
All that yelling freaked
me out a little bit.

165
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,125
Just a little bit, though.

166
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,291
Yeah, just a
teeny-tiny little bit.

167
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,917
[chuckles nervously]

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,875
Yrying to run away
won't help you.

169
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,208
[REINHARD]
That's enough.

170
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,750
[ALL gasp]

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
[TON]
Red hair...

172
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,041
And a knight's sword
with scratches

173
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,041
made by dragon claws...

174
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,583
Can that be...

175
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,166
...Reinhart, the Master
Swordsman?!

176
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,291
Looks like I don't need
to introduce myself.

177
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,375
Though, to be honest, that
nickname is a bit much for me.

178
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,125
I don't know how much help my
modest strength can be to him,

179
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,375
but if you wish to resort
to extreme measures,

180
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,834
let me warn you.

181
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:20,542
As a knight... I will
have to fight back.

182
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,250
[TON]
S-Screw this business!

183
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,875
It's not worth it!

184
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,166
Glad we both came out
of that unscathed.

185
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,917
Lucky break, huh?

186
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,500
Uh! Allow me to thank you
from the bottom of my heart!

187
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,208
You helped me out without ever
once giving it a second thought!

188
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,417
I, Subaru Natsuki, deeply admire

189
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,333
your selfless act of
bravery and kindness!

190
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,250
Hey, come on now, there's no
need for such formality.

191
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,208
Once it was two of
us against three,

192
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,917
those thugs lost their
advantage on the situation.

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,208
Things might've been
different if I were alone.

194
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,333
[SUBARU] Wow, his nice-guy
index is off the charts.

195
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:03,166
So you're... Master
Swordsman Reinhard, right?

196
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,875
It's "Reinhart," Subaru.
Just Reinhart.

197
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,500
[SUBARU] We went from
zero to buddy-buddy fast!

198
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,083
Well, thanks again,
Reinhart. I appreciate it.

199
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,792
I shouted for help
over and over,

200
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,917
but you're the only one
who answered my call.

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,250
I'm so pathetic.

202
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,834
Don't be so down on yourself.

203
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:22,041
For most, it's too risky to face
off against people like them.

204
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,917
Listen, as far as I'm concerned,

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,875
you were right to
call for the guards.

206
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,667
[SUBARU] So would that
make you a guard, then?

207
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,542
You don't look like one.

208
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,375
Well, today I happen
to be off-duty,

209
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,083
so I'm not in the
standard uniform.

210
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,250
And I know that I don't look

211
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,875
particularly
intimidating either way.

212
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,750
[SUBARU] But they did call you
"Master Swordsman," didn't they?

213
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,834
So...

214
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:45,291
[REINHARD]
My family is a bit unique.

215
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,750
Most of the time,
I don't feel like

216
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:49,709
I live up to their
expectations.

217
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,333
Anyway, Subaru...

218
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:55,041
Your name, your clothes,
and that haircut are... unusual.

219
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,041
What nation are you from?

220
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,542
At the moment, Lugunica
is a bit more on edge

221
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,792
than in peacetime.

222
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,583
If you're having problems
while you're here,

223
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:05,208
I'm happy to help out
in any way I can.

224
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,000
Would you come to the
loot house with me?

225
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,208
[REINHARD]
What?

226
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,125
Uh... Never mind.

227
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,834
Forget about it.
I don't wanna bother you.

228
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,792
Especially on your day off.

229
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,625
I'll handle the rest of
this on my own, somehow.

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,792
But... I'd appreciate it if you
could deliver a message for me.

231
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,458
Of course, I'd be glad to.

232
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:28,000
What would you like me
to say, and to whom?

233
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,250
[SUBARU] Well, I don't exactly
know her name, but...

234
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,709
Have you seen a girl with
white robes and silver hair

235
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,625
around here lately?

236
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,208
White robes and
silver hair, huh?

237
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,041
Oh, and she's also
exceptionally beautiful!

238
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,208
No. It doesn't ring a bell.

239
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,125
[SUBARU] Well, if you
do happen to see her,

240
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,834
tell her not to come near the
loot house, no matter what.

241
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:52,458
I'll find what she's looking for
and bring it to her myself,

242
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,709
no problem at all, 'kay?

243
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,125
[REINHARD]
Very well then.

244
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,625
If I see her, then I'll be sure
to relay your message.

245
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,166
Thanks a lot.

246
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,667
I'll repay you one day!

247
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,291
[REINHARD]
Sure!

248
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,750
Take care.

249
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:12,125
[GUY A] You're lookin'
for Felt's den, huh?

250
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,583
You're close.

251
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,667
Just head straight this way
another two blocks or so.

252
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,834
[SUBARU] Great. Thanks,
I appreciate it, man.

253
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,959
Hey, not a problem at all, kid.

254
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,333
Now live strong and take care.

255
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,333
[SUBARU] The question is whether
Felt will come back there

256
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:25,917
before the meeting.

257
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,333
I'd rather catch her before she
makes her way to the loot house

258
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,375
and trade her the cell
phone for the insignia,

259
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,458
which should prevent--

260
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,083
[ELSA] Oh, dear! I'm sorry!
Are you all right?

261
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,709
Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry!

262
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:40,041
I don't look it, but toughness
is one thing I've... got...

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,041
[gasps]

264
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,166
[ELSA giggles]

265
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,417
[ELSA] What's wrong? You
don't have to be so scared.

266
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,458
I'm not gonna do
anything to you.

267
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,792
What? I'm not scared!

268
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,417
Just a little
surprised, that's all.

269
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,667
Whatever gave you that idea?

270
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,542
[ELSA]
Your scent....

271
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,208
When people are scared,

272
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,917
I can smell the fear on them
like a kind of perfume.

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,250
And you're definitely
scared right now.

274
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,834
You're angry as
well, aren't you?

275
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,333
At me.

276
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,291
[ELSA]
It's fine.

277
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,208
I am rather curious,

278
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,709
but now isn't the time
to start a commotion.

279
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,750
That's not a very
nice thing to say.

280
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,458
If you're too scary, that beauty
of yours will go to waste.

281
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,333
Oh, very good.

282
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,667
Conceal your hostility,
and you'll be even better.

283
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,792
[ELSA]
Well, I'll be going now.

284
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,542
Something tells me
we'll meet again.

285
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,834
[sighs]

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,500
[SUBARU] What a dump.
Someone actually lives here?

287
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,750
If I didn't know any better,

288
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:09,041
I'd say Elsa had already been
here and trashed the place.

289
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,375
I-It's fine, I'm sure.
I don't smell blood.

290
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:16,250
It does smell like a bunch
of garbage, though.

291
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,834
[FELT]
Hey!

292
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,375
What do you think you're doin',
peeking into someone's house?

293
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,709
You're wasting your time.

294
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,917
There's nothing worth
stealing in there, anyway.

295
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,291
Now, beat it!

296
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,250
No, hang on a second!
That's not what I was doing!

297
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:27,959
Don't gimme that!

298
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,542
Whoa! Stop it!

299
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,750
Calm down! This is no time to
fight! It's gonna be dark soon!

300
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,166
[FELT] Before then,
you'd better be gone.

301
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,083
[SUBARU] I already told you,
you've got it all wrong!

302
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,917
You don't give up, do you?

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,166
I told you to get
outta here, so do it!

304
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,625
Stop it! Just listen to me!

305
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,667
[gasps]

306
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,166
[SUBARU screams]

307
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,500
[SUBARU] P-Please! Listen to
me! Just hear me out, Felt!

308
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,583
[FELT]
Hm?

309
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,333
I'm here on important
business, okay?!

310
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,291
How do you know
my name, anyway?

311
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,583
Do you want me to steal
something for ya?

312
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,208
You shoulda just said so.

313
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,500
You're the one who attacked
me right off the bat!

314
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,709
This is a greedy business
you're running, you know that?!

315
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,583
Do you pride yourself on
your sticky fingers?!

316
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:32,667
I'm just tryin' to
stay alive out here.

317
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,709
If it weren't for this, I'd be
forced to sell my body.

318
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:39,125
So what do you want
with me? Spit it out.

319
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,625
There's only one thing I want,

320
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,291
and that's to buy the
insignia you stole,

321
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,750
right here and now!

322
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:47,083
My client didn't mention any
partners when I was hired.

323
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,166
Hang on, are you a business
rival or something?

324
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,667
Call her a rival, or call her
the one who killed my parents,

325
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,125
or the one who killed me, even.

326
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,208
At the end of the day, it
doesn't make any difference.

327
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,917
You're not making any sense.

328
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,500
But when it comes down to it,

329
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,458
I only care about selling
to whoever pays the most.

330
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,750
If you've got an offer that
might be profitable to me,

331
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:04,792
I'll listen.

332
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,959
How shrewd. It's all
about the money.

333
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,208
I have a rare item in my
possession that's worth

334
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,792
more than 20 holy coins.

335
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,667
I want to buy your
insignia with it.

336
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,083
And it's something that's
in high demand nowadays.

337
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,917
See? A metia.

338
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,959
[SUBARU]
That is the power of a metia!

339
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,875
This little number is
a one-of-a-kind item

340
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,375
that can capture and
freeze a moment in time.

341
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,166
So how about it?

342
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,125
Well, you don't
seem to be lying...

343
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,834
But is that supposed to be me?

344
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,458
I look much prettier than that.

345
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:37,417
If you look this good without
makeup, you're doing just fine.

346
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,750
Don't complain about it.

347
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:41,458
[FELT] It is unusual,
I'll give you that much.

348
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:44,500
But I really doubt it's worth
more than 20 holy coins.

349
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,875
You're a prospective
buyer in this situation.

350
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,083
You don't think I'm
just gonna believe

351
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,083
whatever you tell me
as fact, now do you?

352
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,375
Come on.

353
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,500
[SUBARU] I see your point...
No, probably not.

354
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,333
There's a loot house down at
the far edge of these slums.

355
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,583
Think the fair thing to do is
have it appraised by the guy

356
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:02,041
who lives there, Old Man Rom.

357
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,792
So it still comes to that...

358
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,208
Okay, got it. Let's go.

359
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,583
Right now! Let's get
moving! On the double!

360
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,041
We'll just have him
take a look at it

361
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,834
and then get out of there
as soon as possible!

362
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,417
[FELT]
Take it easy!

363
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:20,083
[FELT]
What's your problem? Slow down!

364
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,792
Why're you in such a hurry?

365
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,333
You're sweating like crazy.

366
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,083
Oh, well, anyway, live strong.

367
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,875
Someone else here in the slums
said that a little earlier.

368
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,417
Is it like a slogan
or something?

369
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,667
Look, don't lump me in
with those other guys.

370
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,458
They're all talk. They don't
"live strong" at all.

371
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,333
They're nothing but a
bunch of stingy losers

372
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,333
who've got nothing
going for them.

373
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:45,250
[SUBARU] Wow, that's kinda
harsh. Judgmental much?

374
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,542
I'm not like the other
people around here, okay?

375
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,834
I have no intention of living
out the rest of my life

376
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,750
in these dingy,
dirty back alleys!

377
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,208
Is that so?

378
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,750
And you think 20 holy coins

379
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,959
will make these dreams
of yours come true?

380
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,166
Not by themselves,

381
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,291
but it would be a huge
leap toward my goal.

382
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,583
Even if I were alone, it's
not as if I couldn't get by

383
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,458
with some effort.

384
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,125
If you were alone?

385
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,667
[FELT]
Just forget it.

386
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,166
What are you standing
there smirking about?

387
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,000
You really piss me off,
ya know that?

388
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,166
Don't worry about it.

389
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,458
H-Hey, what are you doing?

390
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,834
Stop!

391
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,041
I'll make this all
work out somehow.

392
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,041
It's something only I can do.

393
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,041
Don't get all sentimental one me
while you're babbling nonsense!

394
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,166
I'll bite you!

395
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,834
[SUBARU]
It's not just for her.

396
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:42,083
I'll change the fate
that's waiting for me.

397
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,667
And to do that, I'll...

398
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,500
[FELT]
I told you to cut it out!

399
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:51,625
[SUBARU screams]

400
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,542
[ROM]
Hmm...

401
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,625
So this is a metia...

402
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:58,834
Well, I've heard of 'em,

403
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:00,875
but I've never seen
one with my own eyes.

404
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,375
[SUBARU]
It's a fairly delicate device,

405
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,208
so I suggest you
handle it with care.

406
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,458
Just think of it
along the lines of,

407
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:07,875
"If you break it,
you have to die."

408
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:10,125
In the sense that
you get no do-overs.

409
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,291
[ROM]
Yeah, I'm definitely impressed.

410
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,542
If I were to sell this,

411
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,709
I'd take no less than
15, no, 20 holy coins.

412
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:20,333
'Cause I'd likely not
come across one again.

413
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,333
So it's worth at least that.

414
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:23,542
[SUBARU chuckles]

415
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,917
[SUBARU] All right!
Negotiations complete!

416
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,417
Now, if we're done talkin',

417
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,583
let's go for drinks to celebrate
a properly completed sale!

418
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,083
What do you say?!

419
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,166
[FELT]
Hold it.

420
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,625
Why are you in such
a hurry to leave?

421
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,709
Well, life doesn't last
forever, you know?

422
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:41,959
Make every second count.

423
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,375
Don't waste any time.
Live every moment--

424
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,000
[FELT] Yeah, yeah. I don't
care about all that stuff.

425
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,458
Fess up.

426
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,291
Why exactly do you want the
insignia so badly anyway?

427
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,166
I mean, if I've got two
interested parties

428
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,333
in this thing, it must be worth
a lot more than it looks.

429
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:57,917
That's why everyone's
gunning for it.

430
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,500
In other words,
in an open bidding,

431
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,208
this would sell for way
more than a me--

432
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,583
Hang on, Felt!

433
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,458
You're stepping into dangerous
territory right now!

434
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,375
You heard what
the metia's worth!

435
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,083
You're getting a good deal here!

436
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,041
Just trade it to me
and be done with it!

437
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,583
El-- I mean the woman
who asked you for it

438
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,166
can't go higher
than 20, either.

439
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,583
She's not gonna
pay more than that!

440
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,458
[FELT]
Hmph.

441
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:21,667
How do you know what
she's willing to pay?

442
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,625
So you're not working
together, huh?

443
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,542
You're tryin' to con me.

444
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,625
It's not like that!

445
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,166
Please, we're running
out of time!

446
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,291
Begging will get you nowhere.

447
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,250
I'll be fair and acknowledge
you as a negotiating party.

448
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,458
But it wouldn't be right not to
hear from my original client.

449
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,792
[SUBARU] Okay, fine. The reason
I want that insignia...

450
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,625
...is so I can go and
return it to its owner.

451
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:47,959
[FELT]
Huh?

452
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,667
I need to take it back
to the one it belongs to.

453
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,834
That's why I want
the insignia, okay?

454
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:54,208
It's the truth! So please!

455
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,750
Listen, I don't
think he's lying.

456
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,250
I've got a sense about
these sorts of things.

457
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,417
Now don't get
taken in by his act.

458
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,250
He's obviously not sincere.

459
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,709
Return it to the owner?
Ridiculous!

460
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,875
If you're gonna lie,
make it believable!

461
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,417
I won't be fooled,
you got that?!

462
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,917
Felt, please...

463
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,500
[knocking]

464
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,959
Who could that be?

465
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,750
[FELT]
It's probably for me.

466
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,709
It's a little early, though.

467
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,208
[SUBARU]
Don't open it!

468
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,667
[FELT]
Huh?

469
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,333
We'll be killed!

470
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,458
I'm not here to kill you!

471
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:54,709
Why would you think I'd try
and do something so insidious?

472
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:55,959
[gasps]

473
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,291
[grunts]

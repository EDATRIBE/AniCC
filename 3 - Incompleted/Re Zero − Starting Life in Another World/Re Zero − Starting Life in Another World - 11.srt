Or wait, is it two heads?

Whatever! That doesn't
matter right now.

182
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,333
The point is, three
heads thinking together

183
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:58,625
are way harder to break
than one arrow by itself!

184
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,417
So don't think
about stuff alone!

185
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,583
Just learn to trust and
rely on those around you!

Ram, which way should we run
to get outside the barrier?

190
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,125
[RAM] We'd have to run
left at full speed.

What's your plan?

00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,709
[SUBARU]
Hmm...

193
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,125
I could shove Rem toward you,

194
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,000
take a dramatic turn
and briefly stare at you two,

195
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,458
and then run tragically
to the right...

196
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,125
So you want to draw
the ulgarm's attention

197

while I take Rem
and run to safety?

198

Could you not reduce
my heroic moment

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,125
to such a simple plan?

200
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,458
No, there's no way you
can survive on your own.

201
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:33,208
I'm begging of you.

202
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,834
Please don't. You mustn't.

Don't go worrying about me.

204

I have a brilliant idea for
rounding up all the mabeasts

you do all this?

Well, the thing is...

208
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,041
[SUBARU] You were my

I ever went on.

I could never be so heartless
that I'd abandon you.

211
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,083
Right.

212
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,875
I guess I'd better go ahead
and get this thing going, then.

213
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,125
Take care of Rem, okay?

214
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,542

be used to it...

Hey... Are you awake?

279
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,083
Was I the one who did this?

00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,333
Like, grabbed you
and never let go?

281
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:36,458
Uh, well, not exactly. It, uh...

282
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,375
It was me... to be honest.

283
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,125
I was watching you
and it looked like you

284
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,875
were in pain while
you slept, so I...

285
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,041
[SUBARU]
You held my hand?

286
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,500
[REM] I don't know what
to do at times like these.

287
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,917
It's always so confusing
and overwhelming.

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,083
So I did what would have
made me the happiest

289
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,750
if I were in your place...

290
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:57,542
I'd like to hear
the rest of that.

291
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,750
I mean, uh...

292
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,375
I'd like to find out
how everything ended.

293
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,500
Like, were my curses removed?

294
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,583
They were.

295
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,375
Lord Roswaal was
meticulous and took care

296
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,709
of all the mabeasts
in the forest.

297
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,667
So there's no chance
the curses placed on you

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,291
will ever activate.

I'm so sorry, Subaru.

00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:21,208
Lift your head up, Rem.

There's nothing wrong with me.

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
You know, you always look
so calm and collected.

305
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,583
But you're not either of
those things at all, are you?

306
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:34,375
I'm aware of my shortcomings.

307
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,750
At the heart of it all,

308
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:39,208
I'm a powerless and incompetent
demon clan dropout.

309
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,583
So no matter what I do,
I can never match my sister.

310
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,583
I'm only her replacement.

311
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,959
One far inferior
to her, at that.

312
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,458
Good for nothing.

313
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,125
I don't get it.

314
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,709
Why was I the only
one between us

315
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:56,875
that kept her horn?

316
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,083
Why couldn't it have been her?

317
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,750
Why couldn't Sister
be the one to keep hers?

318
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,083
Why was she born
with only one horn?

319
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,625
I've caused her
nothing but trouble

320
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,125
since the day of our birth.

321
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,667
It's my fault.

322
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,667
Why did we have come
into this world as twins?

323
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,291
Goodness, I'm sorry.

324
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,834
That was a strange
thing for me to say.

325
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:19,333
Please forget it.

326
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,083
[SUBARU]
You know, Rem...

327
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,709
You keep putting
Ram on a pedestal

328
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:27,208
while undermining yourself
at the same time.

329
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,083
Putting yourself down.

330
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,125
But I don't think her
situation would be any better

331
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,625
if she were in your position.

332
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,000
Ram is weaker than you,
she can't cook,

333
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,792
she slacks off on the job,
she says mean things...

334
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,792
[REM]
Y-You're wrong!

335
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:45,291
If she had her horn, you
wouldn't say things like that.

336
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,959
[SUBARU]
But Ram doesn't have her horn,

337
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,709
so I don't know that Ram.

338
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:51,583
I've never seen her
any other way.

339
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:52,834
To be perfectly honest,

340
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:54,542
I'm pretty sure you're
the only one who cares

341
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,417
whether she has one or not.

342
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,792
And what Ram
doesn't have, you do.

343
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,500
You should just acknowledge
and accept that.

344
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,083
You're kind, hardworking,

345
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,458
and you always do your
best, no matter what.

346
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,542
Your chest is even
bigger than hers, too!

347
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,125
But seriously, if you
hadn't been around,

348
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,291
those dogs would've
chewed me to death.

349
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,041
I was saved because
you were there.

350
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,625
As you can see,
I'm alive right now.

351
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,291
Not only because of
everything your sister did,

352
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,959
but because of you.

353
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,500
My true Sister could've
done much more back there.

354
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,917
[SUBARU]
You may be right.

355
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,208
But the one who was
there for me was you.

356
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,250
[REM gasps]

357
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,709
[SUBARU]
I'm glad you were there.

358
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:40,333
Thanks for saving me.

359
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,125
Didn't you hear?

360
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,417
I told you that I'm only
my sister's replacement,

361
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,625
nothing more.

362
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,417
Don't define yourself
that way, all right?

363
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,667
It's too sad.

364
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,291
'Course, I haven't
actually heard the details

365
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,333
about how she lost her
horn in the first place.

366
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,542
And I won't ask,
so I'll never know.

367
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,375
Since I don't,
that means I get to talk

368
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,250
as if I know all about it.

369
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,834
Listen carefully.

370
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:06,291
All you have to do is be
the horn Ram doesn't have.

371
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,250
If you do that, you two
can be a demon together.

372
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,792
Also, you call yourself
a replacement...

373
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,250
but no one could
ever take your place.

374
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,667
But I...

375
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,500
[SUBARU] Where I come from,
there's an old saying,

376
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,583
"Demons laugh when
you talk about next year."

377
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,583
And you're a demon.

378
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,625
So just laugh, Rem.

379
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:31,083
Wipe off that sad face,
and laugh.

380
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,667
Laugh while we talk
about the future!

381
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,917
Let's talk about things
while we look forward to

382
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,750
making up for all
the time you've wasted

383
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,792
by looking back.

384
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,458
We can start by
talking about tomorrow.

385
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,166
[REM]
Wait... Tomorrow?

386
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,458
[SUBARU]
Yep! Absolutely!

387
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:51,041
You can say anything...
Like, uh...

388
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,917
Whether you'll make
a Japanese, Western,

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,458
or local-style
breakfast tomorrow...

390
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,333
Or whether you'll put on
your right or left shoe first.

391
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:00,792
It can be something
silly like that.

392
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,542
No matter how it might sound,

393
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,959
you can talk about tomorrow
because you have a tomorrow.

394
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,959
How about it?

395
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,667
Listen. I-I'm very weak.

396
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,875
So I'm certain that
I'll end up depending

397
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,625
and leaning on you.

398
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:17,375
[SUBARU]
What's wrong with that?

399
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,750
I may be weak, stupid,
and scary-looking.

400
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:22,375
And, as I'm sure you've noticed,
I'm pretty dense...

401
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,959
But I never let that stop me.

402
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,083
I still live my life expecting
others to take care of things

403
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,375
for me when I can't handle it.

404
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,208
We can just lean on each
other as we move forward.

405
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,750
Let's laugh and
talk about tomorrow,

406
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,458
with our arms around
each other's shoulders.

407
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,709
After all, I've dreamed
of laughing and talking

408
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,333
about next year with
a demon since I can remember.

409
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,500
You are demonically inspired.

410
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:50,667
You know it.

411
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,834
[REM laughing]

412
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,375
[ROSWAAL]
By the way, Ram...

413
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,792
Did you happen to find the one

414
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,000
who was controlling
the mabeasts?

415
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,208
[RAM]
Yes...

416
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,000
But the trail has
already vanished.

417
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,333
One of the children
Barusu and Rem brought back

418
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,709
from the forest
mysteriously disappeared

419
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,375
from the village the next day.

420
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,542
[ROSWAAL] Was this connected
to the battle for the throne,

421
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,625
as well?

422
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,834
The Bowel Hunter,
mabeast masters...

423
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,458
We've certainly gotten involved
with some bizarre characters,

424
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:39,750
haven't we...?

425
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,625
No matter how many
strange characters you face,

426
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,542
you aren't the sort of man
who would lose heart

427
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,792
and turn tail, are you?

428
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:45,834
My goodness!

429
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,000
You've grown so very audacious.

430
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,333
Come here.

431
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,959
Now, then... Shall we begin?

432
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,917
After all, I was unable
to attend to you

433
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,458
for a whole night.

434
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:03,917
Yes, I realize that.
I'm sorry, please do.

435
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,083
[ROSWAAL] You've used
quite a lot of mana.

436
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,125
May the stars protect you.

437
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,291
[ROSWAAL] I will be busy
again for a time.

438
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,250
I know it will be
difficult for you,

439
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,250
but I'll be counting
on you and Rem.

440
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,375
[RAM]
As you wish.

441
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,917
Since that fiery night,

442
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,208
my body has belonged
to you, Lord Roswaal.

443
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,792
This battle for the throne...

444
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,834
I must win, no matter
what it takes to do so.

445
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:36,041
For the sake of
my ultimate goal...

446
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:41,959
For the coming day
when I kill the dragon...

447
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:44,792
[EMILIA]
I've noticed something.

448
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,250
You're constantly getting hurt,
aren't you, Subaru?

449
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,208
You came to this mansion
because you were injured

450
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,542
in the first place.

451
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,625
And it's only been
four days since then.

452
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:54,834
Hey, give me a break.

453
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,917
It's not like I get hurt
because I want to.

454
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,291
The world's a
pretty harsh place,

455
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,000
but I think it's a little,
uh, harsher on me.

456
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,083
With that in mind, you're
welcome to spoil me rotten,

457
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,667
since no one else will, Mee-Lee!

458
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,542
What do you say?

459
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,250
[EMILIA]
Don't joke around.

460
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,458
Puck kept trying to stop me
from leaving the cottage

461
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:11,417
and going after you
guys to help, too.

462
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,208
Who knows what would've
happened if Roswaal

463
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,375
hadn't made it back?

464
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,875
You understand now?

465
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,125
[EMILIA]
Still...

466
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,041
I suppose you saved me again.

467
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,125
[SUBARU]
Huh?

468
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,208
[EMILIA] I brought you
to the mansion

469
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,417
as thanks for rescuing me,

470
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,291
and you've gone and
repeated that favor

471
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,000
without a second thought.

472
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,500
So I just wanted
to say thank you!

473
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,667
Hey, it's fine! Really!

474
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,083
I only did it because
I wanted to!

475
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,375
There's no thanks needed!

476
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,875
I thought you
might say that,

477
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,083
but I don't feel any better
about you putting yourself

478
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,333
in danger.

479
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,458
I should do something
to show my gratitude...

480
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:44,500
I see.

481
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,291
Well, I'll take you
up on that...

482
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:50,125
...by having you go on a
date with me, Mee-Lee!

483
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,000
And what is a "date"?

484
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,834
[SUBARU] We'll go out together,
see the same things,

485
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:55,709
eat the same things,
do the same things,

486
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:57,041
and share the same memories.

487
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,625
We'll spend our time just
laughing and having fun.

488
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:01,667
And that's really all you want?

489
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,250
That's exactly what I want.

490
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,583
I wanna show you off
to those bratty village kids,

491
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:06,959
and there's this
awesome flower field

492
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,417
to walk through, too!

493
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,625
Even if all we do is stroll
around and look at stuff,

494
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:12,709
it'll be a special
occasion for me!

495
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:17,959
All right, then.

496
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,667
I'll go on a "date" with you.

497
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,125
It sounds like fun!

498
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:25,875
[SUBARU]
Yes!

499
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,792
That's why you're my EMF!

500
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,625
Oh! That's just a cool acronym.

501
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:32,166
"EMF" stands for
"Emilia, major fairy"!

502
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,375
[EMILIA laughs]

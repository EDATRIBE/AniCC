[screaming]

2
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,583
M-My arm!

3
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,709
I still have it, right?

4
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,000
I guess I came back again...

5
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:32,250
No, wait... Maybe I should
say I made it back...

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,875
[BOTH whimpering]

7
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:37,917
Oh, I'm sorry. Good morning.

8
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:43,250
Right. I guess you don't
remember me, do you?

9
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,834
Sorry for the trouble
I've caused till now!

10
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:49,750
Subaru Natsuki is
gonna start over!

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,333
[SUBARU] Oh, and what day
and time is it right now?

12
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,458
[SUBARU] It's my third first
day in the Roswaal mansion.

13
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:30,959
That chill I felt...

14
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,000
Does that mean I died in
my sleep the first time

15
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,375
due to physical weakness?

16
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:40,083
But the second time...
there was an attacker.

17
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,667
So if I was killed, does
that mean the other folks

18
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,959
here in the mansion were
likely targets, as well?

19
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,250
'Cause we're involved in
Emilia's royal selection,

20
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,000
like at the loot house?

21
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,417
But even if I know that,

22
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,542
I have no proof to explain
it or any way to avoid it.

23
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,709
And what makes things worse
is that I didn't get a chance

24
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:59,291
to see the attacker's face,
or the other victims.

25
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,166
My death was totally in vain.

26
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,041
[BEATRICE] Quit pacing around.
You're really irritating me.

27
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,625
So stop or get blown away.

28
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:07,959
[SUBARU]
Oh, sorry.

29
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,083
It may sound weird, but
walking around in circles

30
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,542
makes the gears in my
head turn a lot easier.

31
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,750
Cut me some slack.

32
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,041
We're close now, aren't we?

33
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,750
Exactly what sort
of relationship

34
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,166
do you think we have, I suppose?

35
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,000
We're not best friends
having only met twice.

36
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,208
Listen, I'll be out of your
hair as soon as I can, okay?

37
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,417
Just serve some tea or
something, and let me relax.

38
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,250
As if I'll serve you
anything, I suppose.

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,792
Ugh, you are so irritating!

40
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,959
[SUBARU] What's that book
you're reading, anyway?

41
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,458
[BEATRICE]
It tells how to get rid of bugs

42
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,834
that have gotten into
my room, I suppose.

43
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:41,667
Whoa, you've got bugs
here in the library?

44
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,417
Man, really sucks for you, huh?

45
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,166
So what kind are they?

46
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,917
You've long exceeded
your welcome here,

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,291
so it's time for you to leave.

48
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,792
Your hands have stopped shaking,

49
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,792
so you can more easily disguise
your fear now, I suppose.

50
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,000
Y-You could tell?

51
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,875
You were trying to
hide it, I suppose.

52
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,625
It feels rather vexing to be
treated as a mere convenience.

53
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,709
You're not very nice
at all, are you?

54
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,875
Well, thanks for helping me.
I'll see you again soon.

55
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,000
[BEATRICE] I don't want to
see you again, I suppose.

56
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,917
So refrain from coming
in here anymore.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,667
Shoo, shoo.

58
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,166
"Shoo, shoo," really?

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,375
Wait a sec, when you said
"bugs," did you mean me?!

60
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,375
[growls]

61
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,500
Just get out of
here this instant!

62
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,125

63
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:28,875
[SUBARU]
If not for this flower bed,

64
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,333
that would've been
instant death.

65
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,750
[EMILIA]
Um...

66
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:35,083
That looked painful.
Are you all right?

67
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:35,834
[SUBARU]
Huh?

68
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:37,709
Of course, Mee-Lee!

69
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:40,333
Your kindness is the one
thing that can heal me.

70
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:43,208
Just so you know, Rem
spread manure as fertilizer

71
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,125
all over that flower
bed yesterday.

72
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,583
[SUBARU screams]

73
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,375
Th-Three-second rule!
That didn't count!

74
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,083
That didn't count, okay?!

75
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,625
You know, believe it or not,

76
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,625
they say this kind of
thing happening to you

77
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,959
is actually sorta lucky.

78
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,542
Mee-Lee is already shifting into
consolation mode with me...

79
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,917
[chuckles]

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,208
Hey, Puck! Rise and shine!

81
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Hey, there. Good morning, Lia.

82
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,208
Good morning to you, Puck.

83
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,083
Sorry to ask this of you, being
that you only just woke up,

84
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,917
but could you wash off Subaru?

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,875
Wash him off?

86
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,959
Oh! Okay, no problem.

87
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:23,583
Here!

00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,208
There you go! All clean!

91
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,792
Not bad, huh?

92
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,792
[SUBARU]
I thought I was a goner...

93
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,917
Wasn't there some other way
you could've cleaned me up?

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,500
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

95
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,166
That's not true at all, Subaru.

96
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,166
Ah!

97
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,959
Oh, yeah?! Take this!

98
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, now you've done it!

99
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,291
Yeah, you like that?

100
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,583
It's my lethal move called
"Make the Cat Cry"!

101
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,125
[PUCK]
Cut it out!

102
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,875
Tail punch!

103
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,750
And I'll finish you
with my paw-pad grind!

104

Grind, grind, grind, grind...

00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:09,041
[EMILIA laughing]

106
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,834
I-I'm sorry, I just can't--

107
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:16,625
What in the world...? What're
you--? What are two doing?!

108
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,208
Oh, my stomach! I'm dying!

109
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,792
Well, I suppose
I've bounced back

110
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,250
from my initial bad impression.

111
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,625
I do thank you for your
assistance, dear Father!

112
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,125
Who are you calling "Father"?

113
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,583
I won't give you my
daughter that easily!

114
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:29,834
Please stop that.

115
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:32,291
You're both too funny. I...

116
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,250
[PUCK]
You've got a great smile, Lia.

117
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,709
You agree, don't ya, Subaru?

118
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:39,375
Yes. Totally.

119
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,000
To me, Mee-Lee's lovely smile

120
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,625
is the first shining
star in the night sky!

121
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,875
Aww, come on, Subaru.

122
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,917
What did you mean by
"Mee-Lee," anyway?

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,250
Where did that come from?

124
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,834
Uh?

125
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,875
It's what's commonly referred to
as a nickname or a pet name.

126
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,083
Pretty much the same thing
as when Puck calls you "Lia."

127
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,041
It's meant to be a playful
expression of affection

128
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,250
that shows two
people's closeness.

129
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,417
I see.

130
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,917
But that would imply
you and I are close

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,417
when we hardly know each other.

132
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,625
[SUBARU gasps]

133
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,166
You've got a point, and
that hurts somewhat,

134
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,917
but I won't lose heart!

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,208
Think of it as an advance
on our relationship.

136
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,875
It means I want us
to get close enough

137
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,208
to call each other by
playful pet names.

138
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:15,917
Okay?

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,542
[EMILIA gasps]

140
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,709
[PUCK chuckles]

141
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,417
A-All right. I suppose
I can accept that.

142
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,500
N-No, please, don't look at me!

143
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,041
I really expected
her to cringe,

144
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,041
but I got a positive response.

145
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,375
What could this reaction
mean, Commentator Puck?

146
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,083
She doesn't have
very many friends,

147
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,583
so she craves things like
nicknames and being playful.

148
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,208
Really easy to please, ya know?

149
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,875
My main heroine is
easy to please, huh?!

150
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,500
[REM] Sister, Sister,
it's only been a short time,

151
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,875
and now our guest looks
like a drowned rat.

00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,959
[RAM]
Rem, Rem, in just a short time,

153
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,709
our guest has turned
into a dirty old washrag.

154
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:54,208
I know I'm a mess, okay?

155
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,333
I don't need the two
of you to tell me.

156
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:59,834
[BOTH] Our lord, Master Roswaal,
has returned to the premises.

157
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,750
Please, come inside.

158
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,625
Here we go...

159
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:08,291
My third first meeting with
the lord of the mansion.

160
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,875
[SUBARU] All I know for certain
in this current loop of events

161
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,250
is that somebody is going to
attack on the fourth night.

162
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,208
It would be ideal if I could
let them know and warn them,

163
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,583
but I wouldn't be
able to explain

164
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,291
where I got the information,

165
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,917
so they might think I'm
working with the assassin.

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,542
If I knew even as little as
the attacker's physique,

167
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,792
it could be a different story...

168
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,834
So this time around, I'll use
these next four days to gather

169
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:34,583
as much information as
I can and find out who it is.

170
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,208
And to do that...

171
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,458
You may have any
reward you request.

172
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:42,500
So simply name your
desire and it shall be.

173
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,834
[SUBARU]
In that case,

174
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,875
I ask that you let me live
here as a house guest,

175
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,583
and eat and sleep
as much as I want!

176
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,959
How am I supposed to go about
gathering information, anyway?

177
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,500
Didn't really think
about all that.

178
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,417
Guess I'll start off with
some indirect questioning.

179
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,041
That's the place where I fell...

180
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,667
Sorry for all the
trouble I caused.

181
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,625
[REM] Don't mention it.
If you'll excuse me, sir.

182
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,166
Hey, wait.

183
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,667
We didn't even get
a chance to talk.

184
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:25,792
[SUBARU]
Hmm.

185
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,250
Nothing out of the
ordinary here.

186
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,792
[clanking]

187
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,333
[ROSWAAL]
What isn't ordinary?

188
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:34,875
[SUBARU]
Roz...

189
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,834
Don't sneak up and scare me
like that. It's misleading.

190
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,250
[knocking]

191
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,792
Yes?

192
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,625
Tea time, sir. Here you are.

193
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,333
[SUBARU]
Oh, uh, thanks...

194
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:51,500
Wanna drink it with me?

195
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,125
That's very kind,
but no thank you, sir.

196
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,917
Hey, you know, if you wanted
to be a little friendlier,

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,750
that'd be fine by me.

198
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,333
Well, it is my first day.
Guess that's expected.

199
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,375
Yo!

200
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,667
You come in here every day
without even knocking.

201
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,125
Seems you truly have
no manners whatsoever.

202
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,792
It would be in your
best interest to leave

203
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,542
before you get blown
away, I suppose.

204
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,083
Whoa! H-Hang on a second!

205
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,625
I just wanted to ask you
something! That's all!

206
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:26,291
Is there any magic that can
weaken and kill someone,

207
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,542
but makes it look like
they're just going to sleep?

208
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,583
If I must answer,
then yes. There is.

209
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,917
Are you serious?

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,250
[BEATRICE]
But it's not so much magic

211
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,333
as it is a curse, I suppose.

212
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,750
Actually, there are many
such things among the spells

213
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,583
that shamans specialize in.

214
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,041
So what are shamans?

215
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,333
[BEATRICE]
Magicians...

216
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,917
Originating in the northern
nation of Gusteco,

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,125
they're actually a subclass

218
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,875
of magic and spirit
arts users, I suppose.

219
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,125
They're all quite useless,
to be perfectly honest.

220
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,583
And not to be taken seriously.

221
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,166
But to achieve that result,
there is an easier method

222
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,792
than a curse, I suppose.

223
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,208
[SUBARU]
There is?

224
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,917
I think you've
already experienced

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,291
what I'm talking
about first-hand.

226
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,166
W-Wait, do you mean...?

227
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,917
That mana drain you did against
my will could actually kill me?!

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,583
[SUBARU gasps]

229
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,500
In case you didn't know, mana
is also one's life essence.

230
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,542
If you continually
suck it out by force,

231
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,417
one could feasibly die
of weakness, I suppose.

232
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,792
[SUBARU]
Wait, hold on.

233
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,000
You're not the one who
killed me, are you?

234
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,291
Sorry to disappoint you,

235
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,333
but I'm too busy for
such an endeavor.

236
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,709
I couldn't even spare
the effort to kill you.

237
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:33,041
It's not worth my time.

238
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,125
This what you're after?

239
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,166
--[BEATRICE] Hmph.
--Uh, Okay...

240
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,041
Anyway, can pretty much anyone
do that mana-sucking thing?

241
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,125
That's an absolutely terrible
way to put it, I suppose.

242
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,542
In this mansion, only
Bubby and I are able to.

243
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,375
Even Roswaal is incapable.

244
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,500
Oh. Must mean it's actually
a pretty rare skill, then.

245
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,333
Well, now that I know, don't
suck up that stuff too much.

246
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:55,834
Especially from me.

247
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,917
With everything I've been
through, I'd die in an instant.

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,542
I'm really short of
blood right now.

249
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,917
Yes, all of your
organs were restored,

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,333
but your blood wasn't
replaced, I suppose.

251
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:07,667
Not that I have any obligation
to do such a thing, anyway.

252
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,834
My organs?

253
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,542
You know, the way you
said all that just now

254
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,166
kinda makes it sound
like you were the one

255
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,417
who magically healed my
wounds and saved my life.

256
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,125
Trying to take credit
for what Mee-Lee did

257
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,625
makes you look pretty bad!

258
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,333
What in the world are
you talking about?

259
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,166
That silly girl
doesn't have the power

260
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,250
to heal fatal wounds
yet, I suppose.

261
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,375
[SUBARU]
Huh?

262
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,709
She and Bubby may
have stabilized you

263
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:29,959
and brought you here,

264
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,792
but I was the one who
used magic to heal you.

265
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,250
Huh?! F-For real?
You're kidding, right?

266
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,959
Wait, I get it.

267
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,125
You're lying about this
whole thing, aren't you?

268
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,250
It's not nice to lie!
Lying, bad!

269
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,458
Shut up, I suppose.
You're too averse to the truth.

270
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:47,625
Which means you should
disappear, I suppose!

271
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:48,542
[gasps]

272
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,250
[screams]

273
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,500
[EMILIA]
Uhh...

274
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,667
Once again, are you all right?

275
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:58,875
[SUBARU
So, in the end,

276
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,083
the key words are
"curse" and "chains."

277
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,333
I don't know anything else.

278
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:06,166
If the conditions for Return
by Death are the same,

279
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,000
I died three times
in the capital,

280
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,208
and survived the fourth time.

281
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,375
But that doesn't mean
I intend to treat this

282
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,959
as a throwaway life.

283
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,667
That's why I asked Puck to
keep an eye on Emilia for me.

284
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,667
I don't wanna mess this up.

285
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,875
[PUCK]
Yeah, you got it.

286
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,500
Everything you're
saying is pretty vague,

287
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,667
but I can tell you're
asking out of concern for Lia.

288
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,792
[SUBARU] On the morning
of the fourth day,

289
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,709
I'll leave here and--

290
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,291
[knocking]

291
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,917
[RAM]
Pardon my intrusion, sir.

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,709
You really are studying,
sir. I'm surprised.

293
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:36,834
[SUBARU]
"Surprised", huh?

294
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,667
Wow, that's a pretty
rude thing to say.

295
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,625
I mean, I am a guest
here, you know.

296
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:43,125
You're a freeloader
calling yourself a guest.

297
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,000
'Least that's how I perceive
it, sir. Here you go.

298
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,709
Thanks all the same.

299
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:52,125
[SUBARU]
Ugh... It's still nasty.

300
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,959
[RAM] Careful, you're
going to incur the wrath

301
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,458
of the finest tea
leaves in the mansion.

302
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,500
Slacking off right in
front of your guest?

303
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,250
I have no words for
that nerve of yours.

304
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,667
Having a seat, drinking tea.

305
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,917
Well, you were the
one who told me

306
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,500
I should be friendlier,
remember?

307
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,750
So I suppose you could say

308
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:10,041
I'm only responding
to your demand.

309
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,291
How's your studying
coming along so far?

310
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,792
[SUBARU]
Not bad.

311
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,417
I'm able to read some simple
fairy tales like these now.

312
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,917
It's interesting how the morals

313
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,333
differ just slightly
from the ones I know.

314
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,875
It's like true cross-cultural
communication.

315
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,792
Maybe I should import
a few fairy tales

316
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,875
from my homeland to
show you what I mean.

317
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,917
Like "The Red Ogre Who Cried.

318
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,000
"The Red Ogre Who Cried"?

319
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,792
Intrigued, huh? You
want me to tell it to you?

320
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,083
Now, you really need to
pay attention, okay?

321
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,625
This is how it goes...

322
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:48,417
"Once upon a time, there lived
a red ogre and a blue ogre.

323
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,458
The two were the best of
friends, just inseparable.

324
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,625
One day, the red ogre
wanted to be friends

325
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:57,166
with the people of
the nearby village.

326
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,500
He approached, but the
people were too scared

327
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,291
to get close to him.

328
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,709
The blue ogre couldn't bear
to watch this happen,

329
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:06,709
so he devised a plan
to help his friend.

330
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:09,333
'I'll make a ruckus in the
village and frighten everyone.

331
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:11,375
When I do, you come and stop me.

332
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,125
After that, the villagers
will be sure to trust you.'

333
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,375
The plan worked,
and just as predicted,

334
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,000
the red ogre befriended
the humans.

335
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,875
But as time passed, something
he noticed began to worry him.

336
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,917
His friend, the blue ogre,
no longer stopped by to visit.

337
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,542
One day, the red ogre decided
to go to the blue ogre's house.

338
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,000
The place looked abandoned.

339
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,542
The shades were drawn
in the windows,

340
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,834
and the door was
shut and locked.

341
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:42,041
There was a letter attached
to the door that said,

342
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,333
'Red Ogre, please have fun

343
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:47,333
with your new human
friends and companions.

344
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:48,959
If I continue to
hang around you,

345
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,750
I'm afraid they might think
you're a bad ogre, too,

346
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,417
and end the friendship
you sought from them.

347
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,417
Thus, I've decided
to go on a journey.

348
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,458
I'm not sure if I'll return,
but I will never forget you.

349
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:05,041
Goodbye. Please take
care of yourself.

350
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:10,625
Your friend now and
forever... Blue Ogre.'

351
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:14,208
The red ogre read the letter
in silence, over and over.

352
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,792
He began to cry. And the
tears welled up in his eyes."

353
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,458
That's the end.

354
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,750
[RAM]
That's a sad story.

355
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,250
Yeah, it is.

356
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,625
But even with an
ending like that,

357
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:28,667
I think it's kind of
a sweet story, also.

358
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,917
[RAM]
If you ask me,

359
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,667
all the characters in
it are just stupid.

360
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,959
The red ogre, the blue ogre,
and the villagers, too.

361
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,917
Wow, that's a pretty harsh
critique, don't you think?

362
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,375
I mean, sure, I'm not
denying it, but...

363
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,083
...that's probably
the reason why I both

364
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,166
love and hate that
story, honestly.

365
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,041
The blue ogre's self-sacrifice
is really appealing,

366
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,917
but it's stupid because
he gets nothing out of it.

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,500
I'm the type that
wants to be rewarded

368
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,458
for the effort I put in.

369
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:59,250
Is that really what you
think about the blue ogre?

370
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,375
To me, it's the red ogre
that I feel is beyond help.

371
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,333
He dragged the blue ogre
into his own desires,

372
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,500
and as a result,
he lost nothing.

373
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,834
Only the blue ogre
lost anything.

374
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:11,291
[SUBARU]
Interesting point.

375
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,959
Then what do you think the
two of them should've done?

376
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,291
If the red ogre truly
wanted to become friends

377
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,792
with the humans in the village,

378
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:21,208
he should've broken off his
horns and gone to them.

379
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,375
If he had done that
from the very beginning,

380
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,208
the blue ogre might've stayed.

381
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,667
[SUBARU] I-I think you're
missing the point.

382
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,667
That's a pretty
extreme opinion...

383
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,166
You really think so?

384
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,667
Answer this:

385
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,959
Which of the two ogres would
you rather be friends with?

386
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,041
Which of the two?

387
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,125
[RAM]
The red ogre, who can only wish

388
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,709
to be taken care of by others,

389
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:44,208
or the blue ogre, basking
in his own self-sacrifice?

390
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,667
What a boring answer.

391
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,291
If you want to
befriend both of them,

392
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,041
I can only conclude
that you must be

393
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,083
the indecisive, adulterous type.

394
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,333
You'll regret it one day.

395
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,667
[SUBARU]
How can you say that?

396
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,834
I don't recall it being
that kind of story.

397
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,792
Putting aside the questionable
fairy tales of your homeland,

398
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,709
did any of these stories
leave an impression on you?

399
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,166
[SUBARU]
Well, let's see.

400
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,667
The ones that interested me most

401
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,667
were the one in the
middle about the dragon,

402
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,667
and the one at the
end about the witch.

403
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,917
I finally know where the name

404
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,709
"Dragon's Kingdom of
Lugunica" came from.

405
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:25,792
[RAM]
Oh?

406
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,000
[SUBARU]
It said the royal family

407
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,583
signed a covenant with a dragon,

408
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:32,041
so it's more a folk tale than
a fairy tale, wouldn't you say?

409
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,625
[RAM]
Yes, I would. Since it's true.

410
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:38,000
The noble dragon lives far away,
beyond a great waterfall.

411
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,333
But even with that distance,

412
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:42,208
the dragon still upholds
its duty to protect us.

413
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,333
It was in the royal
family's contract

414
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,458
and must be honored
till it's fulfilled.

415
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,959
Wait a sec.

416
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,792
The royal family that has the
contract with the dragon,

417
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,709
didn't they die out recently?

418
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:54,333
They did. Rather
abruptly, at that.

419
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:57,750
No one's sure what the noble
dragon wants to do now.

420
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:59,667
In the nation's
current situation,

421
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,917
I imagine only
the gods are aware.

422
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,542
No, at this point,
only the drag on knows.

423
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,834
[SUBARU] Oh, by the way,
about this witch story.

424
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,333
I don't wanna discuss that.

425
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,959
I've stayed here far too long.

426
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,375
When dinner has been prepared,

427
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,208
I will stop by to
notify you, sir.

428
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,041
Oh, okay.

429
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,583
Do me a favor.

430
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:26,500
That story you told me about
the ogres, don't tell it to Rem.

431
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,333
I'm certain that she
wouldn't like it very much.

432
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,208
"A scary witch.
A truly terrifying witch.

433
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,709
To even speak her name
would chill you to the bone.

434
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:46,625
Everybody referred to her as...

435
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:48,458
...the Witch of Envy."

436
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,667
Are you sure about this?

437
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,208
We could call a
dragon-drawn carriage

438
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,000
to take you to the capital,
it's no trouble!

439
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,709
Thank you, but I'll be fine.

440
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,291
And one day, when
I've finally become

441
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,417
the kind of strong, smart,
rich man who's worthy of you,

442
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,250
I'll come to you on a white
horse to take you away with me.

443
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,417
Do you have a handkerchief?

444
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,417
And water, and plenty
of lagumite ore?

445
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,125
Let's see, and will you be
able to sleep by yourself?

446
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,792
[SUBARU]
Do you think you're my mom?!

447
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,959
Safe travels to you,
Subaru. I wish you well.

448
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,250
And don't lose the
gift I gave you.

449
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,417
As an attempt to equate

450
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,125
our three-days-worth of
memories together,

451
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,542
I gave you a little something.

452
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,291
[clinking]

453
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,959
Oh, hush money, right?
Don't worry, I get it.

454
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,500
I won't say anything
I shouldn't.

455
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,875
I swear to the dragon.

456
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:34,500
Hah, just talking with
you makes any evil scheme

457
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,709
seem to lose its purpose.

458
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,667
And in case you didn't
know, in this nation,

459
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,542
swearing to the dragon is
the highest form of promise.

460
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,500
Make sure you never
forget it, okay?

461
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,000
You got it!

462
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,375
The two of you
helped me out so much.

463
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,291
Especially you, Rem-Rem.
Thanks for all the great food.

464
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,250
And Ram, you...

465
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh! Yeah! You're really
good at cleaning toilets!

466
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,083
[REM]
Sister, Sister. What a shame.

467
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,458
Our guest is hopelessly
bad at flattery.

468
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,083
[RAM]
Rem, Rem. What a shame.

469
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,166
Our guest has a fatal
lack of flattery skills.

470
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,583
[SUBARU]
Oh, shut up!

471
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,417
I seriously couldn't think
of anything to say, okay?!

472
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,458
Thanks, though. I appreciate it.

473
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:11,834
[BOTH]
Yes, sir.

474
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:19,750
[EMILIA]
Subaru.

475
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,208
Thanks for all you've done.

476
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,875
If you're ever in need,
come visit us anytime.

477
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,333
Will do!

478
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:32,041
[SUBARU]
Thanks a bunch, Mee-Lee!

479
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:54,500
[SUBARU]
Okay, this is it.

480
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,458
I've got a good view
of Emilia's room.

481
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:02,041
And now, I'll just wait around
for something to happen...

482
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,834
...then stop it.

483
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,959
Rem-Rem would probably get mad
at me for using it like this.

484
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,291
I hope she does, anyway...

485
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,166
I don't wanna die again.

486
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,458
I don't want them
to die, either.

487
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,125
Now what did I tell you,
Subaru Natsuki?

488
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,208
Even if no one remembers
anything that happened

489
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:33,333
when everything repeats...
you remember it, clear as day.

490
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,166
[SUBARU] Now that I
really think about it,

491
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,875
I didn't go shopping
with Rem this time.

492
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:45,208
Just because the food meant
for me was leftover?

493
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,083
[SUBARU] It'll still be a
while before it gets dark.

494
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,583
Come on! Focus! Focus!

495
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,333
[SUBARU yells]

496
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,792
[SUBARU]
Emergency escape!

497
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,959
I saw it! Yes, I saw it!

498
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,500
I saw where the sound
of chains came from!

499
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,917
But is it... coming this way?

500
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,834
[SUBARU]
Nowhere to run...

501
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:22,041
Does this mean I played right
into the attacker's hands?

502
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,250
If you're coming, then come!

503
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:36,583
[clanking]

504
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,959
Now! Don't you have
the nerve to face me?!

505
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,458
[screams]

506
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:46,083
All right, show yourself,
you damn coward!

507
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,542
I've gone through hell trying
to see your face, so come out!

508
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:06,375
[REM]
Then I have no choice.

509
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,500
[gasps]

510
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:18,125
[REM] The ideal scenario
would've been to finish this

511
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,041
without anyone noticing.

512
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:27,792
You're joking...

513
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,291
Right, Rem?

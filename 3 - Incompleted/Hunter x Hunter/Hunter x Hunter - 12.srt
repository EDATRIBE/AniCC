THE LONG AND DIFFICULT PATH,

00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:10,370
BROKE DOWN THE WALL,

378
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,504
AND FROM THERE,

379
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,170

YOU CAME UP WITH THAT PLAN
ON THE SPOT.

382
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,370
( Gon laughs ) I FIGURED
WE COULD USE THE WEAPONS

383
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,237
TO BREAK THROUGH THE WALLS.

384
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,237
BUT IT DID TAKE ALMOST
ALL THE TIME WE HAD LEFT.

385
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:27,570
( Kurapika thinking )
EVEN UNDER PRESSURE,

386
00:21:27,637 --> 00:21:29,837
YOU WERE ABLE
TO CALMLY ASSESS OUR OPTIONS

387
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,037
AND THINK OF A WAY
TO GET AROUND THEM,

388
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,470

WHAT MAKES YOU SO SPECIAL.

GON FOUND A WAY
TO BRING THEM ALL TOGETHER

AND COMPLETE THE TRIAL
AS A TEAM.

395
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,470

MAY BE TOMORROW'S FOE.

WHAT GON DOESN'T KNOW
IS THAT BEFORE LONG,

397

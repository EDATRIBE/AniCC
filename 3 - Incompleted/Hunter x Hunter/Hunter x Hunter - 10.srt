EVEN WHEN HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

146

152
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:37,303
BUT WHEN YOU RAISE YOUR HAND,

153
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:39,870
EVERYBODY KNOWS
EXACTLY WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON

154
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,870
AND WHO'S STRAYING
FROM THE CROWD,

155
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:44,103
AND IF YOU'RE IN THE MINORITY,

156
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:46,103
THERE'S NO CHANCE
FOR A REBUTTAL.

157
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:48,670

ARE CONSTANTLY REJECTED,

AND THE GROUP BREAKS DOWN.

160
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:57,103
AND IN OUR CASE, IT MEANS ALL
FIVE OF US WILL FAIL THE EXAM.

161
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,203

ALL I HAD TO DO WAS STAY DOWN
UNTIL THE CLOCK RAN OUT,

344
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,394
AND WE'D GET 72 YEARS
OFF OUR SENTENCES.

345
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:48,727
BUT NOW WHAT?

346
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,360
DO I STAY DOWN
AND KEEP PRETENDING?

347
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:52,794
Leroute: ALL RIGHT.

348
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:56,527
I'LL BET 20 HOURS
THAT HE REALLY IS OUT COLD.

349
00:18:57,694 --> 00:18:59,260
( Majitani thinking )
OKAY, I GOT IT.

350
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:00,627
THAT'S THE PLAY, THEN.

351
00:19:00,694 --> 00:19:03,134
I'LL JUST KEEP ACTING
LIKE I'M UNCONSCIOUS.

352
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,134
Leroute: THE QUESTION IS
HOW DO YOU PROPOSE

353
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,300
WE GO ABOUT CONFIRMING THIS?

354
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,267
Leorio: OH.

355
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,634
IT'S SIMPLE, REALLY.

356
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,534
( grunting )

357
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:18,867
HEAVY BASTARD.

358
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,867
I FIGURED I WOULD
JUST PUSH HIM OFF THE EDGE.

359
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,867
( Majitani thinking ) THAT'S
THE WORST IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD!

360
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,800
Leorio: IF HE
REALLY IS UNCONSCIOUS,

361
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:34,467
HE'LL FALL TO HIS DEATH,
AND THAT'S THE END OF IT.

362
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,634
Leroute: ARE YOU INSANE?

363
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,267
HIS MATCH
HASN'T BEEN DECIDED YET.

364
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,634
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN ACCEPT THOSE TERMS.

365
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,300
Leorio: DON'T WORRY.

366
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,634
IF HE FALLS
AND KICKS THE BUCKET,

367
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,467
WE'LL FORFEIT THE MATCH,

368
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:52,867
GIVING YOU
A GRAND TOTAL OF TWO WINS.

369
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,134
THAT WORK FOR YOU?

370
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:59,467
Leroute: IT DOES.

371
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:00,634
VERY WELL, THEN.

372
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,740
( Majitani thinking )
WHAT WAS THAT?!

373
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,040
COME ON!
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

374
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:07,207
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY LIFE HERE!

375
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,407
Leroute: IN THAT CASE,
I'M CHANGING MY BET.

376
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:14,574
I BET 40 HOURS THAT HE
ISN'T UNCONSCIOUS AFTER ALL.

377
00:20:14,574 --> 00:20:16,707
THAT'S EVERYTHING I HAVE LEFT.

378
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,574

LITTLE SNEAK.

379
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:23,240

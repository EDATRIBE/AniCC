Gon: HMM.

178
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:22,395
THEN IS THIS MEMORY CARD
A CULT CLASSIC?

179
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:25,028
'CAUSE I DON'T SEE
A TITLE ON IT ANYWHERE.

180
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:28,361
Killua: YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED
ANY VIDEO GAMES, HAVE YOU?

181
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,895
THAT'S PRETTY WEIRD.

182
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,161
Gon: SERIOUSLY?

183
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,828
Killua: THAT'S NOT A GAME DISC.

184
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:34,828
IT JUST HOLDS
A GAME'S MEMORY DATA.

185
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:37,561
Gon: I GUESS THAT MEANS
WE CAN'T USE IT TO PLAY.

186
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:41,128
Killua: NOPE. YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO PUT THE DISC IN HERE.

187
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:43,395
BUT IF YOU INSERT
THE MEMORY CARD

188
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:46,195
AND POWER IT ON
WITHOUT A GAME INSIDE,

189
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,561
YOU CAN SEE
ALL THE DIFFERENT GAMES

190
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:50,361
THAT ARE USING THAT MEMORY.

191
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:51,728
Gon: OH, OKAY.

192
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:54,561
Killua: HUH.

193
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:57,195
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
ONLY ONE GAME SAVED ON IT.

194
00:10:57,228 --> 00:11:00,061
IT'S CALLED "GREED ISLAND."

195
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,001
Gon: "GREED ISLAND"?

196
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:05,401
Killua: WELL, ANYWAY, THERE ARE
A LOT OF SAVES ON HERE.

197
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:08,735
IT MIGHT BE POINTLESS,
BUT I'LL TRY TO COPY THE DATA.

198
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:13,368
Joystation:
COPYING "GREED ISLAND."

199
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:14,535
Killua: OKAY.

200
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:19,068
Gon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

201
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:22,135
Killua: SEARCHING ONLINE.
WE KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED.

202
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:24,801
LOOKING FOR A STORE
THAT SELLS IT.

203
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,301
♪

204
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,235
WHAT? NO WAY!
NOT A SINGLE MATCH?

205
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:30,901
Gon: THAT MEANS
IT'S ALL SOLD OUT?

206
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:33,568
Killua: BUT I CAN'T FIND
ANY USED COPIES, EITHER.

207
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,501
EVEN A TOTALLY SOLD‐OUT GAME
WOULD BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

208
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,635
WELL, I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE

209
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:41,001
THIS GAME WAS NEVER
ACTUALLY ON THE MARKET.

210
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,301
Gon: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

211
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,235
Killua: MAYBE IT WAS
AN INDIE GAME OR SOMETHING

212
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:47,401
AND IT NEVER GOT DISTRIBUTION,

213
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:49,168
OR IT COULD EVEN BE A GAME

214
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:50,901
THAT WAS BANNED FROM SALE
FOR SOME REASON.

215
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:53,901
I'LL KEEP LOOKING
AND SEE WHAT I CAN FIND.

216
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:57,735
GOT IT. WELL, IT TURNS OUT

217
00:11:57,735 --> 00:12:00,401
IT WAS ACTUALLY SOLD
THROUGH LEGITIMATE CHANNELS.

218
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:02,408
Gon: IT SAYS, "'GREED ISLAND,'

219
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:06,208
A HUNTING GAME
EXCLUSIVELY FOR HUNTERS."

220
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:09,408
Killua: FOR HUNTERS, HUH?
WHAT THE‐‐

221
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:11,208
‐ ( cash register dings )
‐ LOOK AT THAT PRICE TAG!

222
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:13,208
Gon: 580 MILLION?!

223
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:14,808
Killua: IT'S 5.8 BILLION!

224
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:15,575
Gon: SAY WHAT?!

225
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,741
Killua: THAT'S CRAZY.

226
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:18,908
NO GAME HAS EVER
COST THAT MUCH MONEY.

227
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:23,175
Gon: ONLY 100 COPIES WERE MADE.
THAT'S NOT VERY MANY, IS IT?

228
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,708
Killua: NO,
IT'S PRACTICALLY NOTHING,

229
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:27,008
WHICH MEANS THE DEVELOPERS
WERE REALLY COCKY.

230
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,708
BUT IT MAKES SENSE.
THE PRICE TAG IS RIDICULOUS,

231
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:32,708
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE A HUNTER.

232
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:34,575
THAT EXPLAINS HOW THEY SOLD OUT.

233
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:37,241
Gon: DO THE DEVELOPERS
HAVE ANY MORE LEFT IN STOCK?

234
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:41,341
Killua: GOOD QUESTION. I GUESS
IT'S WORTH A SHOT TO ASK THEM.

235
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:43,808
Woman: I'M SORRY.

236
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:47,175
THE GAME YOU'RE INQUIRING ABOUT
IS NO LONGER IN STOCK,

237
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,208
AND UNFORTUNATELY
THERE ARE NO PLANS

238
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,641
TO RE‐RELEASE IT AT THIS TIME.

239
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,908
Killua: OH, OKAY. THANK YOU.

240
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,708
THAT WAS A DEAD END.

241
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,341
Gon: THEN WE'LL HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE WHO HAS A COPY

242
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,381
AND SEE IF THEY'LL
LET US HAVE IT.

243
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:02,748
Killua: YOU'RE RIGHT.

244
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,081
SO FIRST WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO LOCATE A SELLER.

245
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:08,215
WHY DON'T WE POST AN AD
ON A REVERSE AUCTION WEBSITE?

246
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,581
Gon: BUT WHERE WILL WE
GET THE MONEY?

247
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:12,748
Killua: WE'LL POOL OUR MONEY
FROM THE ARENA,

248
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:16,415
AND THAT GETS US
TO JUST OVER 800 MILLION.

249
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,848
Gon: WE STILL NEED
ANOTHER 5 BILLION.

250
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,348
Killua: NOT NECESSARILY.

251
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:21,415
Gon: HUH?

252
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:23,048
Killua: WITH THESE
PRIVATE DEALS,

253
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,648
THE SELLER HAS ALL THE POWER,

254
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:26,415
AND THEY USUALLY
SET A HIGHER PRICE

255
00:13:26,481 --> 00:13:28,315
THAN WHAT THEY
ORIGINALLY PAID FOR IT.

256
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:30,715
Gon: THEN IT'LL COST EVEN MORE?

257
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:32,015
Killua: PROBABLY.

258
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:34,815
Both: HMM.

259
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:38,581
Gon: WELL, WE CAN STILL POST
A WANT AD, JUST IN CASE.

260
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:42,215
Killua: YEAH, BUT I DOUBT
ANYBODY IS GONNA CLICK ON IT.

261
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:44,081
Gon: "WE ARE LOOKING FOR A GAME.

262
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:47,315
"DOES ANYBODY HAVE
'GREED ISLAND' FOR SALE?

263
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:50,415

00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:04,088
Gon: WOW, LOOK! WE ALREADY
HAVE MORE THAN 10,000 HITS.

267
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:05,688
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

268
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,755
Killua: I THOUGHT SO.
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL TRYING

269
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:10,321
TO UNLOAD
COUNTERFEIT COPIES ON US.

270
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:11,555
CONSIDERING THE HIGH PRICE,

271
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:13,921
WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE
SEEN THIS COMING.

272
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,421
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

273
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,921
NO WAY WE CAN VERIFY
EVERY ONE OF THESE OFFERS.

274
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,088
BESIDES, WHAT'S THE POINT

275
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:23,388
IF WE CAN'T EVEN TELL
IF IT'S THE REAL GAME?

276
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:25,655
Gon: THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO NOW?

277
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:28,588
Killua: WELL, WE NEED TO UNCOVER
A LOT MORE INFORMATION.

278
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:30,588
LET'S DIG DEEPER ONLINE.

279
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,588
BUT I'M REALLY NO EXPERT
IN ALL THAT STUFF.

280
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:37,588
Gon: SO WHO DO WE KNOW WHO'S
INTO GAMING AND THE INTERNET?

281
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:41,155
( Killua gasps )
I THINK I MIGHT KNOW SOMEBODY.

282
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:42,255
Gon: HUH?

283
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:44,188
Killua: IN FACT,
HE MIGHT EVEN OWN

284
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:45,921
A COPY OF "GREED ISLAND"
ALREADY.

285
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,355
Gon: REALLY? YOU THINK SO?

286
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:50,588
Killua: EH, GUESS I'LL ASK HIM,
BUT I REALLY DON'T WANNA.

287
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,755
Gon: WHO IS IT? WHO IS IT?

288
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:53,688
( phone line rings )

289
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:56,755
Killua: HEY. GOTOH, IT'S KILLUA.

Gon: MR. GOTOH?

291
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:04,095
Killua: YEAH.
YEAH, I'M DOING GREAT.

292
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,928
NOW? WHO CARES WHERE I AM?

293
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:09,395
IF I TELL YOU, MOM'S GONNA
FIND OUT SOONER OR LATER.

294
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:12,328
ANYWAY, CAN YOU
GET PIGGY FOR ME?

295
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,395
Gon: WHO'S PIGGY?

296
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:15,761
( pig oinks )

297
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:18,595
Milluki: WHAT?!
KILLUA WANTS TO TALK TO ME?

298
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:21,695
SCREW THAT! TELL HIM
I STEPPED OUT OR SOMETHING.

299
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:23,328
Killua: SHUT UP! YOU'RE LYING!

300
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:24,928
HE HASN'T
LEFT THE HOUSE IN AGES.

301
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:28,595
YOU GO TELL HIM IF HE DOESN'T
PICK UP THE PHONE IN 10 SECONDS,

302
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,261
I'LL BREAK
ALL OF HIS FIGURINES!

303
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:32,261
( Milluki growls )

304
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:34,495
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
JUST PUT HIM ON.

305
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:37,261
HEY, KIL, IF YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT LAYING A FINGER

306
00:15:37,328 --> 00:15:39,528
ON MY COLLECTION,
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

307
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:41,861
Killua: CHILL OUT, BRO.
I WAS ONLY KIDDING.

308
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:44,095
YOU'RE SO SCARY
WHEN YOU GET MAD.

309
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:46,595
Gon: WAIT. YOUR BROTHER?

310
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:53,195
Milluki: WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT, ANYWAY?

311
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:54,928
HURRY UP. I'M BUSY.

312
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:59,195
OH, YEAH. "GREED ISLAND"?

313
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:00,428
I'VE HEARD OF IT.

314
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:01,901
IT'S A SUPER‐RARE GAME.

315
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:05,101
WHY? YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
INTERESTED IN RARE GAMES.

316
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:06,601
Killua: DO YOU OWN A COPY?

317
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,235
‐ Milluki: NO, I DON'T.
‐ ( Killua sighs )

318
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:12,101
Milluki: I WANTED ONE, BUT I
WAS FIVE WHEN IT WENT ON SALE,

319
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,701
AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

320
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:16,768
BUT I HEARD THERE WERE
OVER 20,000 REQUESTS

321
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,668
AND ONLY 100 COPIES.

322
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:24,101
BECAUSE OF THAT, EACH COPY
COSTS A WHOLE LOT OF JENNY,

323
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:25,535
ABOUT 5.8 BIL.

324
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,435
I TRIED TO TRACK ONE DOWN
RIGHT AFTER THE THRILL WORE OFF,

325
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,568
BUT I COULDN'T EVEN
FIND AN OWNER.

326
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:34,601
IT'S LEGENDARY
FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS.

327
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:38,268
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?
YOU LOOKING FOR A COPY, OR WHAT?

328
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:39,601
Killua: KINDA.

329
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:41,535
Milluki: WELL, FORGET IT!
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

330
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,401
EVEN I HAD TO GIVE UP.

331
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,368
Killua: OH?
YOU HAD TO ADMIT DEFEAT

332
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:47,901
'CAUSE IT WAS TOO MUCH
FOR YOU TO HANDLE?

333
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:49,068
( Milluki growls )

334
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:51,268
HEH. THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

335
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:53,501
I'VE GOT A FEW LEADS NOW,
SMART GUY.

336
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:55,701
BUT CONSIDERING
HOW MUCH EFFORT IT WOULD TAKE,

337
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:58,535
NOT TO MENTION MONEY,
IT'S NOT WORTH MY TIME.

338
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:04,608
Killua: SO WHAT WERE THOSE LEADS
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

339
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,375
Milluki: YEAH, RIGHT.
LIKE I'D TELL YOU FOR FREE.

340
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:10,175
Killua: IF I HAD
A "GREED ISLAND" MEMORY CARD,

341
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,275
WOULD YOU RECONSIDER?

342
00:17:11,341 --> 00:17:13,775
Milluki: HUH?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

343

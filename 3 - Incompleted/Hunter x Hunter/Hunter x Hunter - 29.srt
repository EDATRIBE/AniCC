WHO CURRENTLY HOLDS
A RESPECTABLE RECORD

348

IN TERMS OF OFFENSE,
IT WILL OFFER YOU NO ADVANTAGE.

354
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:37,391
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

355
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:40,024
PHYSICAL ATTACKS
WILL STILL CAUSE DAMAGE.

356
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:43,791
AN OPPONENT WHO IS HIGHLY
SKILLED IN THE USE OF NEN

357

WILL BE ABLE
TO PENETRATE YOUR TEN

A LETHAL BLOW.

YOU SHOULD WAIT TWO MONTHS

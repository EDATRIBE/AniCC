TO GIVE THIS TO YOU

198
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,661
WELL, GON, GING IS MY COUSIN.

199
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:16,461
MY FIRST MEMORY OF HIM
IS ACTUALLY OF HIS BACK.

200
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:20,461
I RAN AFTER HIM
EVERYWHERE HE WENT.

201
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:23,761
I THINK I WAS ABOUT THREE.

202
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:27,595
LOOKING BACK ON IT NOW,
IT FEELS LIKE ALL I EVER DID

203
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:29,261
WAS TRY TO KEEP UP WITH HIM.

204
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:33,295
WHEN HE WAS JUST 12 YEARS OLD,
GING LEFT THE ISLAND

205
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:36,595
AND TOOK THE HUNTER EXAM,
SAME AS YOU.

206
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:41,828
OUT OF NOWHERE,
HE JUST SAID HE WAS LEAVING,

207
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:46,061
BUT WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY,
ALL HE SAID WAS...

208
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:49,561
"THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT."

209
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:56,161
BUT THEN HE NEVER ACTUALLY
TOLD ME WHAT IT WAS HE WANTED,

210
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:57,561
SO WE ARGUED.

211
00:12:57,595 --> 00:13:01,335
RATHER, I WAS THE ONLY ONE
DOING ALL THE ARGUING.

212
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:04,268
BUT I NEVER
GOT TO SEE GING AGAIN

213
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:06,768

ORIGINALLY YOU WERE TOLD

215
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:12,768

IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT, RIGHT?

216
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:16,335

WHAT HAPPENED TO MITO'S PARENTS.

219
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,968
NOT LONG AFTER GING
LEFT THE ISLAND.

220
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,468
Mito: AFTER THAT, GING'S DAD
WENT ON A FISHING TRIP

221
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:28,601
AND THEN
JUST MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED.

222
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:30,935
Great‐grandmother: IN THE END,

223
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:34,801
I LOST BOTH OF MY SONS
IN A VERY SHORT TIME.

224
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:40,768
Mito: YES. ALL THAT HAPPENED
AFTER HE WENT AWAY.

225
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:44,401
Great‐grandmother:
GING EVENTUALLY RETURNED

226
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:47,068
TO THE ISLAND
NEARLY 10 YEARS LATER.

227
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:50,468
Mito: WHEN HE DID,
HE WAS CARRYING YOU WITH HIM.

228
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:52,635
YOU WERE STILL
JUST A LITTLE BABY.

229
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:55,735
HE JUST SHOWED UP
COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BLUE

230
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,401
AND ASKED US
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR A WHILE.

231
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:01,008
I ASKED HIM ABOUT YOUR MOTHER,

232
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:03,941
BUT ALL HE WOULD SAY
IS THEY WERE SEPARATED.

233
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:06,175
Great‐grandmother:
AND RIGHT WHEN I

234
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:08,075
WAS ABOUT TO AGREE TO TAKE YOU,

235
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,341
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
SHE STARTED YELLING,

236
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:12,108
"ARE YOU CRAZY?!"
JUST LIKE THAT,

237
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:14,975
AND I IMAGINE EVERYONE
ON THE ISLAND HEARD IT.

238
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:17,408
Mito: GRANDMA! YOU DON'T
NEED TO TELL HIM THAT!

239
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,975
NOW, AS I WAS SAYING,

240
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:23,175

"DON'T YOU
EVER COME BACK HERE!"

LEFT THIS LITTLE BOX WITH US.

250
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:48,641
SHE TRIED TO THROW IT AWAY
SO MANY TIMES.

251

I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO

DIDN'T KEEP PUTTING IT BACK

WANTED TO GET RID OF IT,

YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TOSSED IT
IN A TRASH CAN.

OR BURIED IT AT LEAST.

FOR ME TO USE HIS NAME?

FRIENDS HERE, LIKE, HIS AGE?

THE ONLY KIDS AROUND HERE

278

WERE MYSELF AND YOUR FATHER.

PRACTICALLY BEGGING HIM

281
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:09,855

HE WOULD JUST RUN OFF.

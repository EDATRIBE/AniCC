Hisoka: ALREADY?

346
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:44,734
Woman: YEAH. WHY STICK AROUND
AFTER THE JOB IS DONE?

347
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:47,701
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
THAT NEN STITCHES CAN DO,

348
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:51,867
SO TRY NOT TO OVERDO IT UNTIL
YOUR ARM IS FIRMLY ATTACHED.

349
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:53,534
OH, RIGHT.

350
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,867
I CAME HERE FOR A REASON.

Woman: THE MESSAGE
HAS BEEN CHANGED.

353
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,241
ALL TROUPE MEMBERS

00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:07,307
NOT JUST THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING BETTER TO DO.

356
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:09,407
Hisoka: WILL THE BOSS BE COMING?

357
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:11,041
Woman: PROBABLY.

358
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:14,174
THIS COULD TURN OUT TO BE
OUR BIGGEST MISSION YET,

359
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:16,207
SO KNOW IF YOU BLOW IT OFF,

360
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:19,341
THE BOSS MIGHT
HUNT YOU DOWN HIMSELF.

361
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:20,874
Hisoka: NOW, THAT IS SCARY.

362
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:24,807
OH, BY THE WAY, CARE TO JOIN ME
FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

363
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:29,374
WHAT A PITY.

364
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,041
( door opens, closes )

365
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:40,041
Gon: KILLUA. SO HOW WAS
HISOKA'S FIGHT? TELL ME.

366
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:41,074
Killua: BORING.

367
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:43,841
DON'T WORRY.
YOU DIDN'T MISS MUCH.

368
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:44,807
Gon: BORING?

369
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:51,374
AND HISOKA, DID HE WIN?

370
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:56,241
Killua: OKAY, I WAS LYING.

00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:57,841
Gon: EH?

372
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,041
Killua: IT WAS
AN INCREDIBLE FIGHT.

373
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,314
HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT I WATCHED HISOKA WIN,

374
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:04,981
AND I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW.

375
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:09,147

COULDN'T TELL HOW HE DID IT?

376

Killua: GON, YOU AND ME,

377
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:14,781
WE'VE GOT TO LEARN
ALL THAT WE CAN ABOUT NEN.

378
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,814
( Gon laughs )

379
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,514

IT DOESN'T INTEREST HIM.

384
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:52,514
HE'LL PROBABLY FORGET WHAT
KASTRO LOOKS LIKE BY TOMORROW.

385
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:57,581
HE DOESN'T BELONG
TO ANYTHING OR ANYONE.

386
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:02,287
HE'S HIS OWN MAN,
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT,

387
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:05,121
BECAUSE HE'S
ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED

388
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:06,954
THAT HE'S THE MOST POWERFUL.

GET SAFELY DROPPED OFF

CLOSEST TO THE EXAM SITE.

25
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:43,955

OH, YEAH! LET ME GIVE YOU
A BIT OF ADVICE

00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:53,888
AS A SMALL TOKEN
OF MY APPRECIATION.

30

Gon: ADVICE, SIR?

31
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:57,888
Captain: LOOK. DO YOU SEE
THAT BIG CEDAR TREE,

32
00:02:57,922 --> 00:03:00,222
THE ONE UP ON THE TOP
OF THAT HILL?

TO MAKE YOUR WAY THERE FIRST.

35
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:06,528
IT'S A SHORTCUT
TO THE EXAM SITE.

36
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,128
Gon: A SHORTCUT? GREAT!

37
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:10,528
SO JUST HEAD
FOR THAT TREE, HUH?

38
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:12,128
THANKS FOR THE TIP, CAPTAIN!

Gon: WHAT IS?

48
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:37,562
Leorio: WELL, UH, ACCORDING
TO THIS NOTICE I RECEIVED,

49
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:39,562
THE EXAM IS SUPPOSED TO BE HELD

50
00:03:39,562 --> 00:03:41,695
SOMEWHERE IN ZABAN CITY,
YOU SEE?

51
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:43,895
NOW WE'RE HERE,

52
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:45,728
AND THAT TREE IS THERE,

53
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:48,062
WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
OF ZABAN.

54
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,062
Kurapika: COULD YOU
HAVE MISHEARD THE CAPTAIN?

55
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,562
Gon: I DON'T THINK SO.

56
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:53,895
HE TOLD ME I SHOULD GO
TOWARDS THAT CEDAR TREE.

57
00:03:53,928 --> 00:03:55,562
Kurapika: I SEE.

58
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:58,895
Leorio: AND THIS STUPID NOTICE
ISN'T ANY HELP AT ALL.

59
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:01,135
IT SAYS THE EXAM'S
IN ZABAN CITY,

60
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:03,068
BUT IT DOESN'T
SAY WHERE, EXACTLY!

61
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:04,935
Kurapika: OUR TASK
IS TO FIND THE SITE

62
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:06,902
USING ONLY LIMITED INFORMATION.

63
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,235
THIS IS ANOTHER TEST

64
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:10,602
TO DETERMINE
IF WE'RE WORTHY OF THE EXAM.

65
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:12,268
Leorio: YEAH, I ALREADY
KNEW THAT, SMARTY‐PANTS,

66
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:13,902
SO GIVE IT A REST!

67
00:04:13,902 --> 00:04:16,568
Gon: I THINK I'LL
CHECK IT OUT FOR MYSELF,

68
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:18,735
FIND OUT WHAT THE CAPTAIN
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

69
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:20,268
Leorio: WHOA, WHOA!
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

70
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,135
THE BUS TO ZABAN
IS GONNA LEAVE ANY SECOND.

71
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:25,868
WE NEED TO BE ON IT
WHEN IT DOES!

72
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:27,568
HEY!

73
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:30,902
JEEZ, THE KID'S
TOO TRUSTING FOR HIS OWN GOOD.

74
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:33,568
YOU CAN'T JUST TRUST EVERYONE
ALL THE TIME.

75
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,568
HUH?

76
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,201
KURAPIKA, COME BACK!

77
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,568
Kurapika: I'M INTRIGUED
BY THE CAPTAIN'S ADVICE,

78
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,968
BUT EVEN MORE SO
BY GON'S BEHAVIOR.

79
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:43,535
I'M CURIOUS
TO SEE WHAT HE'LL DO.

80
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:44,735
Leorio: ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.

81
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:46,068
SEE YOU.

82
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,968
IT WASN'T LONG,
BUT IT WAS NICE KNOWING YOU.

83
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:52,568
( scoffs ) ANOTHER FOLLOWER,
JUST LIKE THE REST OF 'EM.

84
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:55,035
NOT ME, THOUGH.
I'M GONNA TAKE THE BUS.

85
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,702
Man: SO IT WAS A TRAP?

86
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,235
Man #2: ALL I'M SAYIN'

87
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,975
IS THAT NONE OF THE BUSES
MADE IT TO ZABAN CITY.

88
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,242
( man #1 laughs )
ROOKIES ALWAYS FAIL THIS PART.

89
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:06,242
THEY BELIEVE
WHATEVER YOU TELL 'EM.

90
00:05:06,242 --> 00:05:07,908
( laughs )

91
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,908
Leorio: HEY, HEY, HEY!
WAIT FOR ME!

92
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:18,242
IT'S JUST I KNEW YOU GUYS
WOULD BE LONELY WITHOUT ME.

93
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,042
PLUS, IT'S NO FUN
TRAVELING ALONE.

94
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:21,575
THAT'S WHY I FIGURED

95
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:23,275
I'D STICK WITH YOU TWO
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

96
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:26,242
( laughs )

97
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:29,642

( bird squawks )

99
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:35,942
Leorio: MAN,
THIS IS ONE CREEPY PLACE.

100
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:38,042
THERE ISN'T
A SINGLE SOUL ANYWHERE.

101
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:41,108
Gon: NO, THERE'S A BUNCH
OF PEOPLE HERE.

102
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,242
Leorio: WHAT?

103
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:45,308
( all gasp )

104
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:58,908
Leorio: WHAT'S UP
WITH THESE GUYS?

105
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,548
Woman: EXCITING.

106
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:03,548
Leorio: UH, EXCITING?

107
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:05,915
Woman: EXCITING.

108
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,648
Leorio: "EXCITING."

109
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,548

110
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:12,915

MULTIPLE‐CHOICE QUIZ!

112
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:17,748

113
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:20,748
( music ends )

114
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,248
Woman: LET ME TAKE A GUESS.
YOU BOYS ARE HEADED

115
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:25,548
FOR THE CEDAR ON THE HILL,
AREN'T YOU?

116
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:27,782
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO GET THERE.

117
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:31,915
YOU'LL HAVE TO PASS
THROUGH THIS TOWN FIRST.

118
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:35,215
YOU MUST PASS A QUIZ
COMPRISED OF A SINGLE QUESTION.

119
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:38,215
Leorio: WAIT A SECOND!
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!

120
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,748
Woman: YOU'LL HAVE
FIVE SECONDS TO ANSWER.

121
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:43,248
IF YOU'RE CORRECT,
THEN YOU CAN MOVE ON.

122
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:46,748
IF NOT, YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED
FROM THIS YEAR'S EXAM.

123
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:48,582
Kurapika: OH, I SEE.

124
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:51,648
IT'S ANOTHER TRIAL WE HAVE
TO PASS BEFORE TAKING THE EXAM.

125
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:53,048
Leorio: SO THAT'S IT, HUH?

126
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:54,882
LUCKY I'M AN EXPERT IN QUIZZES.

127
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,548
WAIT! ONE QUESTION?!

128
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,248
Woman: YOUR ANSWER MUST BE
EITHER THE NUMBER ONE OR TWO.

129
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:02,122
ANY ANSWER THAT IS NOT
THE NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO

130
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,922
WILL BE DEEMED INCORRECT.

131
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:07,588
Leorio: HOLD ON. ALL THREE OF US
HAVE TO SHARE THE SAME QUESTION?

132
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,588
SO IF KURAPIKA HERE
GETS IT WRONG,

133
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,122
IT MEANS
I GET DISQUALIFIED, TOO?

134
00:07:11,155 --> 00:07:12,588
Kurapika: NOT VERY LIKELY.

135
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:14,588
ALTHOUGH,
IF THE ROLES WERE REVERSED,

136
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:16,122
IT WOULD BE
ALL BUT INEVITABLE.

137
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:17,888
Leorio: YOU WANNA REPEAT THAT?

138
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:20,755
Gon: IT'S OKAY! EVEN IF
ONLY ONE OF US KNOWS THE ANSWER,

139
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,788
ALL THREE OF US GET TO MOVE ON!

140
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:24,655
( laughs )
AND I'M REAL BAD AT QUIZZES.

141
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:26,222
‐ Leorio: TRUE.
‐ Kurapika: FAIR POINT.

142
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:27,255
Man: HEY, HEY.

143
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:29,888
HURRY IT UP,
OR I MIGHT ANSWER IT

144
00:07:29,922 --> 00:07:32,255
BEFORE THE REST OF YOU
GET A CHANCE.

145
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:34,122
Leorio: SO WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?

146
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:36,755
Gon: YOU DON'T KNOW? HE'S BEEN
FOLLOWING US PRETTY CLOSELY

147
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,255
EVER SINCE WE LEFT THE PORT.

148
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:39,255
( Leorio gasps ) REALLY?

149
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:40,588
Man: YEAH, SORRY, KID.

150
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:41,955
DIDN'T MEAN TO EAVESDROP,

151
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:44,655
BUT I COULDN'T HELP
BUT HEAR YOU GUYS TALKING.

152
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:45,922
Woman: WHAT WILL YOU DO?

153
00:07:45,955 --> 00:07:47,822
Leorio: HE SEEMS
PRETTY EAGER TO ME.

154
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,588
SHOULD WE LET HIM
GO FIRST, GUYS,

155
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:51,822
SEE WHAT KIND OF QUESTION
WE CAN EXPECT FROM THEM?

156
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,122
Gon: SURE. I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

157
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:54,255
Kurapika: NO OBJECTIONS HERE.

158
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:56,255
Man: LET'S GET TO IT, THEN.

159
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:58,222
( thinking )
ONCE I ACE THIS QUIZ,

160
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:00,288
I'M GONNA LEAVE
A TRAIL OF TRAPS

161
00:08:00,322 --> 00:08:02,095
FOR ANYONE
WHO TRIES TO FOLLOW ME.

162
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:04,095
Woman: NOW HERE
IS YOUR QUESTION.

163
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,895
‐ ( honks horn )
‐ ( bird squawks )

164
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,662
Woman: A GROUP OF EVIL VILLAINS

165
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,762
HAVE KIDNAPPED YOUR MOTHER
AND YOUR TRUE LOVE,

166
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:12,095
AND YOU CAN ONLY SAVE
ONE OF THEM.

167
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:15,262
CHOOSE ONE FOR YOUR MOTHER
OR TWO FOR YOUR TRUE LOVE.

168
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,962
WHICH DO YOU SAVE,
AND WHICH OF THEM DIES?

169
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:21,095
Leorio: HEY!
WHAT KIND OF QUIZ IS THIS?

170
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:23,295
( man chuckles )

171
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:24,828
( buzzer dings )

172
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:26,295
THE ANSWER'S NUMBER ONE.

173
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:29,095
Woman: OH?
AND WHAT'S YOUR REASON?

174
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:30,595

STILL ON THE LOOSE,

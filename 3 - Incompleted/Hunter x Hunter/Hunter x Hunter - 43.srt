WAS PITIFULLY INADEQUATE.

THAT CLASS‐A BOUNTIES

181

FROM OUT OF NOWHERE,

BOLSTERED THEIR SECURITY.

190

THE MERCHANDISE WAS MOVED?

KEPT INSISTING HE DIDN'T KNOW

203

OF THE MAFIA COMMUNITY,

206
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:01,484
LEADERS OF GANGS

207
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:04,651

AROUND THE WORLD.

208
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,751

209
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:11,484

THAT ALL TEN GATHER IN ONE PLACE

210

THEN CARRIED OUT

OF COMBATANTS

214

AND SINCE THE SHADOW BEASTS

217
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:32,484
WEREN'T CALLED UPON
TO GUARD THE AUCTION HOUSE,

218
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:35,651
THE THEORY THAT THEY
DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE COMING

219
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:37,651
HAS EVEN MORE CREDIBILITY.

220
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,451
Uvogin: THAT DOES MAKE SENSE.

221

DID THEY MOVE THE MERCHANDISE?

222

I'M WONDERING.

227
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:06,891
AND THEN WALKED
RIGHT BACK OUT EMPTY‐HANDED.

229

QUITE SIMILAR TO SHIZUKU'S.

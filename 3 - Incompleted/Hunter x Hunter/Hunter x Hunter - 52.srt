WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IT DOES...

343
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:16,252
OR SO THE AVERAGE PERSON
WOULD THINK, BUT...

344
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:17,652
( Chrollo grunts )

345
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:40,152
( Zeno laughs )

346
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:41,952
( yells )

347
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:46,885
I SEE WHAT HE'S DOING.

348
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:50,485
HE CAN TRAP THE ABILITIES
OF OTHERS IN THE CONJURED BOOK,

349
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:54,418
TAKE THEM OUT, AND USE THEM
ANY TIME HE PLEASES...

350
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:59,285
BUT THERE'S A CATCH.

351
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:01,025
HE CAN'T USE THOSE ABILITIES

352
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:04,058
UNLESS HE HOLDS THE BOOK OPEN
THE ENTIRE TIME.

353
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,025
THE CLOAK IS ALSO
A CONJURED ITEM.

354
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,592
IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE HE'S PLANNING TO ATTACK,

355
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:13,392
BUT IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT HE'S ATTEMPTING

356
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:15,025
TO CLOSE THE DISTANCE
BETWEEN US,

357
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:18,692
SO IT MUST BE A DEFENSIVE TOOL
THAT CAN BE UTILIZED

358
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:22,358
TO DRAW CLOSER TO AN ENEMY
AND COUNTERATTACK.

359
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:25,358
WE CAN LOWER THE RISK

360
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,758
IF WE KEEP OUR DISTANCE.

361
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,858
WE'LL WAIT FOR OUR CHANCE,
THEN STRIKE!

362
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:33,358
Chrollo: THIS OLD MAN
IS REALLY SOMETHING.

363
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:36,492
HE MANAGED TO READ MY MIND
IN AN INSTANT.

364
00:20:37,725 --> 00:20:39,892
DOUBT I'D CAPTURE HIM ALIVE.

365
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:44,425
Silva: SO THE ABILITY DISAPPEARS
WHENEVER HE CLOSES THE BOOK.

366
00:20:48,492 --> 00:20:51,025
IN ANY CASE, HE'S IMPRESSIVE.

367
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:54,492
HE'S DODGING
DAD'S ATTACKS BY A HAIR,

368
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:57,358
ALL WHILE KEEPING AN EYE ON ME.

369
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:02,565
HIS ATTACKS HAVE IMPROVED
SINCE LAST TIME,

370
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:06,198
SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY CLUE
WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF.

371
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,032
IF WE WANT TO STOP HIM,

372
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:11,032
WE MAY JUST HAVE TO PAY
WITH OUR LIVES.

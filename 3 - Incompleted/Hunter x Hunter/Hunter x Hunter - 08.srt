00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,645
Killua: HUH?

350
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,812
Leorio: WHAT?

351
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:17,912
Gon: DID HE JUST SAY
THAT HE GIVES UP?

352
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:22,212
Leorio: UH, MAYBE HE MEANT,
"GIVE ME A SEC."

353
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:24,379
Bendot: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

354
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:26,645
Tonpa: I SAID I ADMIT DEFEAT.

355
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:28,312
THAT MEANS YOU WIN, RIGHT?

356
00:18:28,312 --> 00:18:30,312
SO I GIVE UP. I LOSE.

00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,645

359
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:35,979
( Bendot chuckles )

360
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:39,279
( laughs )

361
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:41,112
ALL RIGHT.

362
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:43,879
GUESS THE FIRST ROUND
GOES TO ME, THEN.

363
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:46,912
IF WE WIN TWO MORE ROUNDS,

364
00:18:46,945 --> 00:18:49,279
THAT'S IT.
YOU ALL FAIL THE EXAM.

365
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:52,812
YOU CAN'T ADVANCE,
AND YOU CAN'T TURN BACK.

366
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:55,912
YOU'LL BE STUCK HERE
FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS

367
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:58,312
UNTIL THE EXAM IS OVER,

368
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:00,045
AND IF THAT HAPPENS,

369
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,285
OUR SENTENCES WILL BE REDUCED
BY A GRAND TOTAL OF 72 YEARS.

370

Tonpa: OH, MAN,
AM I EMBARRASSED.

00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,252

TOUGHER WHEN I GOT UP CLOSE.

Leorio: BASTARD!

374
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,885
I KNEW WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TRUSTED YOU!

375
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,985
ALL YOU'RE GOOD FOR IS
SABOTAGING THE OTHER APPLICANTS.

376
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,285
YOU'RE JUST
A WORTHLESS PIECE OF GARBAGE!

377
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,985

THAT'S WHAT I DO EVERY YEAR,

378

FOR AS LONG AS I CAN.

ABOUT PASSING THE HUNTER EXAM.

I'M IN IT FOR THE THRILLS.
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT.

382

Leorio: THE THRILLS?

383
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:40,085
Tonpa: THAT'S RIGHT.

384
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,219
THE EXAM IS A PROVING GROUND

385
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:46,819
DESIGNED TO CRUSH THE DREAMS
OF THE YOUNG AND OVERCONFIDENT,

386
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,719
AND THAT MOMENT WHEN HOPE
AND AMBITION GIVE WAY

387
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:53,785
TO ABSOLUTE DESPAIR‐‐HEH‐‐
I GET A KICK OUT OF THAT.

IS JUST EXQUISITE,

389
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:57,819
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M THE ONE

390
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:59,919
ACTIVELY SHATTERING
THE NEWBIES' DREAMS.

391
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:03,092
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT RUSH.

392
00:20:03,092 --> 00:20:07,025
I'VE NO DESIRE TO BE A HUNTER.
DOESN'T REALLY INTEREST ME.

393
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,092
AND I'VE ALREADY HAD
ENOUGH FUN FOR THIS YEAR.

394
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:13,892
BESIDES, I USUALLY STOP
AT THIS POINT ANYWAY.

Kurapika: WE'RE WASTING TIME
FIGHTING EACH OTHER.

402

IF THEIR GOAL WAS TO KILL
AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE,

403
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:33,259
THEN THE MOVE THE OLD MAN MADE
WAS ACTUALLY THE RIGHT ONE.

404
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:36,159
THAT BALD GUY LOOKS EX‐MILITARY,

405
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,892
PROBABLY A MERCENARY.

406
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,259
IF YOU'D FOUGHT WITH HIM,

407
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,359
HE'D HAVE STARTED
BY CRUSHING YOUR LARYNX.

408
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:44,259
PRETTY HARD TO GIVE UP
IF YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK.

409
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:47,992
THEN HE'D HAVE TORTURED YOU
WITHOUT KILLING YOU

410

411

THAT POSSIBILITY.

00:20:56,092 --> 00:20:58,892
Bendot: WELL, SO MUCH
FOR THAT PLAN, I GUESS.

414
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,932

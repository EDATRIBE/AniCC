Uvogin: WAIT. WHAT?

178
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,066
Kurapika:
WITH MY SPECIALIST ABILITY,

179
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:35,933
I USE 100% OF ALL TYPES OF NEN,

180
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:38,766
AND THE NAME OF MY POWER IS...

181
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,599
EMPEROR TIME!

182
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,166
( Uvogin gasping )

183
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:54,795
Mizuken: CHAINS?

184
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:57,795
Kurapika: YES. WHEN YOU SAID
I WAS A CONJURER,

185
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:00,662
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING
THAT CAME TO MIND.

186
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:03,035
Mizuken: INTERESTING,
BUT WHY CHAINS?

187
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:06,002
Kurapika: IT'S BECAUSE
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE AT LARGE

188
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:10,168
IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW
WHO NEED TO BE CHAINED TO HELL.

189
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:13,035
Mizuken: OH, IS THAT SO?

190
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:16,035
BECAUSE I CAN'T SHAKE
THE NAGGING SUSPICION

191
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,602
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'LL BE CHAINED DOWN.

192
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:20,768
Kurapika: WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW?

193
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:23,035
Mizuken: WAIT A SECOND!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

194
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:24,935
I'M YOUR TEACHER! DO AS I SAY!

195
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:27,868
I'M NOT DONE TALKING TO YOU!
HOLD ON, DAMN IT!

196
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:31,635
LIKE I TOLD YOU,
ORDINARY CHAINS ARE POINTLESS!

197
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,702
THEY'RE INFERIOR!

198
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:33,968
NOT ONLY THAT,

199
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:37,268
CONJURING AN UNBREAKABLE CHAIN
IS IMPOSSIBLE!

200
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,135
REALLY?

201
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:42,335
AH, MAN.

202
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:44,335
YOU REALLY ARE STUBBORN,
AREN'T YOU?

203
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:47,702
CONJURING UNBREAKABLE CHAINS
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

204
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,702
THAT BEING SAID, YOU CAN CONJURE
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY CLOSE.

205
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:53,435
Kurapika: IS THAT SO?

206
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:57,035
Mizuken: WOW. YOU ONLY HEAR
WHAT YOU WANT, HUH?

207
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:58,335
Kurapika: TELL ME HOW!

208
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:01,342
Mizuken: MAKE A CONTRACT
WITH CONDITIONS.

209
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,942
Kurapika: A CONTRACT?
WITH CONDITIONS?

210
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:04,942
Mizuken: YES.

211
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:06,875
DECIDE ON A CONDITION,

212
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,375
A RULE, IN OTHER WORDS,

213
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:12,475
AND SWEAR TO ABIDE BY IT
AT ANY COST, A CONTRACT.

214
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:13,975
THE STRICTER THE LIMITATION,

215
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:17,342
THE MORE POWER YOUR ABILITY
WILL BE ABLE TO GAIN FROM IT.

216
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:21,342
NEN IS AN ADDITIVE PROPERTY
IN MOST CASES.

217
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,375
IF NEN ADDS TO YOUR POWER,

218
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:27,708
A NEN CONTRACT
MULTIPLIES IT EXPONENTIALLY.

219
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:31,175
YOU'LL NEED TO COME UP WITH
A CONDITION FOR YOUR CHAINS,

220
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,542
ONE THAT YOU'RE
PREPARED TO KEEP,

221
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:37,108
BUT IT CAN BE DANGEROUS.

222
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:39,842
THIS TECHNIQUE
CAN BE INCREDIBLY VOLATILE.

223
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,875
IT'S A DOUBLE‐EDGED SWORD.

224
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,342
IF YOU BREAK
THE CONDITION THAT YOU SET,

225
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:48,342
YOU STAND TO LOSE
YOUR NEN ABILITIES ENTIRELY.

226
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,142
( Kurapika sighs )

227
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:54,842
MY ONLY OBJECTIVE IS TO FIND
MY BRETHREN'S SCARLET EYES

228
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,342
AND CAPTURE THE SPIDERS.

229
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:00,375
SO I WANT CHAINS THAT THEY,
THE PHANTOM TROUPE,

230
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:02,815
WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO BREAK.

231
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:05,148
THEY WILL BE MY ONLY TARGETS.

232
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:08,782
Mizuken: YOU'LL USE THESE CHAINS
SOLELY FOR THAT OBJECTIVE?

233
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,548
SEEMS RATHER WEAK TO ME.

234
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:12,548
Kurapika: LET ME FINISH.

235
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:15,348
USING THE CHAINS EXCLUSIVELY
ON THE PHANTOM TROUPE

236
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:17,348
IS NOTHING MORE
THAN A PREREQUISITE.

237
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:20,482
Mizuken: ALL RIGHT.
THEN WHAT IS YOUR RULE?

238
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,382
Kurapika: I STAKE MY LIFE ON IT.

239
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:31,282
Mizuken: HEY, KURAPIKA,

240
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:33,148
WHEN YOUR EYES
TURN SCARLET LIKE THAT,

241
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:35,448
IT MAKES YOUR AURA
LOOK A LOT BIGGER.

242
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:37,215
HOLD ON A MINUTE!

243
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:40,182
LET'S TRY
THE WATER DIVINATION AGAIN.

244
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,048
Uvogin: A SPECIALIST?

245
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:47,648
MOST PEOPLE CAN ONLY USE
ONE TYPE OF NEN,

246
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:49,982
BUT YOU USE ALL OF 'EM?

247
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,182
Kurapika: THAT'S CORRECT.

248
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:01,988

00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,655
( Uvogin gasps )

250
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:07,222
I CAN RECOVER

251
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:11,722
USING ENHANCED
SELF‐HEALING EASILY.

252
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:15,722
Uvogin: I COMPLETELY
SHATTERED HIS LEFT ARM,

253
00:15:15,788 --> 00:15:18,288
BUT HE HEALED IT INSTANTLY.

254
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:21,288
Kurapika: THERE WERE
A NUMBER OF REASONS

255
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:23,288
I CHOSE YOU
AS MY FIRST TARGET.

256
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,355
AS YOU FOUGHT THE MAFIA
AND THE SHADOW BEASTS,

257
00:15:27,388 --> 00:15:29,122
THE OTHER SPIDERS

258
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:32,555
STAYED COMPLETELY
OUT OF THE BATTLE ALTOGETHER.

259
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:35,688
THAT TOLD ME THAT YOU
PREFERRED TO FIGHT ALONE.

260
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:40,122
IT ALSO MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY
TRUSTED YOUR ABILITIES.

261
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:44,122
I ALSO PREFER
TO FIGHT ONE‐ON‐ONE.

262
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:47,455
THAT MADE YOU
THE IDEAL OPPONENT.

263
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:52,055
YOU'RE AN ENHANCER,
AND YOU'RE PROUD

264
00:15:52,122 --> 00:15:55,388
OF YOUR ABSOLUTE PHYSICAL
ATTACKS AND DEFENSE STRENGTH.

265
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,322
IN SHORT, YOU MET
EVERY CONDITION I REQUIRED

266
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:00,322
FOR MY FIRST TARGET.

267
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:04,395
YOU'RE A TEST. IF MY CHAIN JAIL
WORKS AGAINST YOU,

268
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:05,895
THEN IT'S A SAFE BET

269
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:09,395
THAT IT WOULD WORK
AGAINST THE REST OF YOU SPIDERS.

270
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:13,528
THE CHAIN JAIL STRIPS CAPTURED
SPIDERS OF THEIR FREEDOM

271
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:17,662
AND, AS YOU MAY HAVE REALIZED,
ENFORCES ZETSU.

272
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,828
( Uvogin grunts )

273
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:21,662
I GET IT.

274
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:24,628
SO THAT'S WHY
I COULDN'T PRODUCE ANY AURA.

Kurapika: ZETSU, AS I'M SURE
YOU'RE AWARE BY NOW,

277
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:33,528
SHUTS OFF AURA COMPLETELY,

278
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:36,328
MEANING THAT YOU WOULD NEED
TO USE BRUTE STRENGTH ALONE

279
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,295
TO BREAK THESE CHAINS.

280
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:39,128
Uvogin: DAMN IT!

281
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:40,995
Kurapika: IF THE TROUPE MEMBER

282
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:44,028
WITH THE MOST PHYSICAL STRENGTH
CAN'T BREAK THEM,

283
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:45,462
IT STANDS TO REASON

284
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:48,628
THE OTHERS WON'T BE ABLE
TO ESCAPE THEM, EITHER.

Uvogin: HIS ENFORCED ZETSU
IS BAD...

286
00:16:51,828 --> 00:16:53,162
REALLY BAD.

287
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:56,695
NEN DRAWS ITS ENERGY FROM AURA,

288
00:16:56,728 --> 00:17:00,728
AND IF IT'S SHUT OFF,
YOU CAN'T USE YOUR POWER.

WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:24,235
IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT MY ENHANCED FIST

296
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:28,235
IS SLIGHTLY STRONGER
THAN YOUR NORMAL FLESH.

297
00:17:28,235 --> 00:17:30,402

I CAN DEFEAT
EVERY TROUPE MEMBER BAREHANDED.

301
00:17:37,235 --> 00:17:39,902

EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

SUCH ATROCITIES

320

AND NOT FEEL ANYTHING?!

321
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,342
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE?!

322
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,208
ANSWER ME!

I HAVE PIERCED YOUR HEART
WITH THE STAKE OF RETRIBUTION.

329
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:04,748
I AM NOW GOING TO SET A RULE.

330
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:09,082
BREAKING IT WILL ACTIVATE
THE CHAIN AND CRUSH YOUR HEART.

331
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:13,748
AND THE RULE IS...

332
00:19:13,748 --> 00:19:18,248
THAT YOU HAVE TO ANSWER
ALL OF MY QUESTIONS TRUTHFULLY.

333
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:23,248
ABIDE BY THAT RULE, AND I
WILL LET YOU LIVE A BIT LONGER.

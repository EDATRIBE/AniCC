WITH A UNIQUE AND DISTINCT AURA

42
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:48,122
THAT DOESN'T FALL
WITHIN THE OTHER FIVE CLASSES.

43
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:51,056
IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

44
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:53,756

THAT SUITS YOU.

46

ARE HIGHLY PERSONAL,

00:03:57,856 --> 00:04:00,929
WITH TWO AREAS
OF PARTICULAR PROMINENCE...

48
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:03,629
THE ABILITY
THAT YOU'RE BORN WITH

49
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:07,929
AND OF COURSE THE ABILITY THAT
YOU'VE REFINED LATER IN LIFE.

50
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:11,562
FOR EXAMPLE, GON HERE
WAS BORN WITH MUSCLES

51
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,196
THAT ARE MORE FLEXIBLE
AND SPRINGY THAN MOST.

52

SPENT MOSTLY IN NATURE.

54
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,196
SO YOU SEE,

55
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,629
FROM THE MOMENT OF BIRTH,

56
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,862
YOUR NEN ABILITY FALLS WITHIN
ONE OF THE SIX CATEGORIES.

57
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:30,796
IT'S POSSIBLE FOR YOUR NEN AURA
TO CHANGE TYPES LATER ON,

58
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:32,929
ALTHOUGH THAT'S QUITE RARE.

59
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:36,429
IF YOU ATTEMPT TO LEARN
A NEW ABILITY,

60
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:38,862
ONE THAT DOESN'T FIT

61
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:41,029
YOU WILL HAVE A HARD TIME.

62
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:47,796
THIS DEPICTS THE COMPATIBILITY
OF THE SIX CATEGORIES.

63
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:50,296
THE CLOSER A CLASS IS
TO YOUR OWN,

64
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:52,396
THE GREATER YOUR CHANCES
OF LEARNING IT.

65
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:56,129
IF YOU ARE BORN WITH AN AURA
OF THE ENHANCER CATEGORY

66
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,862
YOU WILL FIND ENHANCER ABILITIES
EASIEST TO LEARN AND MASTER.

67
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:03,102
THE ADJACENT TRANSMUTER
AND EMITTER CLASSES

68
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,636
WILL ALSO BE EASY TO PICK UP.

THE SPECIALIST CLASS
WHICH IS FURTHEST AWAY

71
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:12,469
WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY
PROVE QUITE DIFFICULT.

72
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:16,869
I'LL DEMONSTRATE USING SKILLS
YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN.

73

( chorus vocalizing )

74
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,636
HISOKA IS ABLE
TO CHANGE HIS AURA

75
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:24,269
INTO A RUBBER‐LIKE SUBSTANCE,
SO HE'S A TRANSMUTER.

76
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:27,969
GIDO USES HIS TOPS AS A WEAPON
BY MAKING THEM SPIN FASTER,

77
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:30,902
WHICH IS AN ENHANCER POWER.

78
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:33,902
BUT TRYING TO MANIPULATE
SO MANY TOPS AS WEAPONS

79
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:36,302
ALSO REQUIRES
THE SKILL OF A MANIPULATOR.

80
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,569
SINCE THAT ISN'T
VERY COMPATIBLE,

81
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:39,969
HE WASN'T VERY EFFECTIVE.

82
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:42,902
AS FOR KASTRO,
HIS TIGER BITE FIST

83
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:45,569
WAS INCREDIBLY STRONG.
HAD HE MASTERED IT,

84
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:48,569
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMONG
THE STRONGEST NEN USERS.

85
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:53,069
I BELIEVE THAT HIS AURA
FELL INTO THE ENHANCER CLASS.

86
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,069
HOWEVER, HE MADE THE CHOICE
TO FOCUS HIS ENERGY

87
00:05:56,102 --> 00:06:00,302
ON THE POWER TO CREATE A DOUBLE,
WHICH IS A CONJURER ABILITY.

88
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:02,942
HE ALSO REQUIRED
THE ABILITY OF A MANIPULATOR

89
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:04,776
TO CONTROL THE DOUBLE.

90
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,142
AS YOU CAN SEE,
BOTH OF THOSE

91
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:09,942
ARE RELATIVELY FAR
FROM THE ENHANCER CATEGORY.

92
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:11,109

93
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:14,309

CORRECT.
LEARNING AN INCOMPATIBLE ABILITY

OF HIS TRAINING,

00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:12,312
‐ ( gasps )
‐ ( grunts )

173
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:17,378
Man: PAKUNODA!

174
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:19,278
HEY, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

175
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,712
Pakunoda: LONG TIME,
NO SEE, SHALNARK.

176
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:23,778
‐ YOU TOO, PHINKS.
‐ ( Phinks scoffs )

177
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:26,045
YOU SURE
TOOK YOUR TIME GETTING HERE.

178
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:29,012
Pakunoda: OH?
RIGHT ON TIME BY MY WATCH.

179
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:32,478
Phinks: YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO ARRIVE HERE 10 MINUTES EARLY.

180
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:33,878
SAME FOR YOU GUYS.

181
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,012
Shalnark: BONOLENOV! KORTOPI!

182
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:40,878
SO, YOU'RE GOING WITH US, TOO?

183
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:42,878
Man: HEY!

184
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:46,678
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN QUITE A WHILE.

185
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:49,512
I'M REPORTING FOR DUTY, BOSS.

186
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:53,678
WHAT'S OUR TARGET THIS TIME?
I'M ITCHIN' FOR OUR NEW ORDERS.

187
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,312
Shalnark: EASY NOW, UVO.

188
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:58,212
FEITAN'S GROUP
WON'T BE ARRIVING UNTIL EVENING.

189
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:00,852
WE'LL WAIT
UNTIL EVERYONE'S HERE.

190
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:02,985
Pakunoda: IMPATIENT AS USUAL.

191
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:06,552
Uvo: DAMN. THAT'S
AN ENTIRE HALF‐DAY OF WAITING.

192
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:09,818
HEY, IF IT ISN'T SHIZUKU.

193
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:11,985
Shizuku: HELLO.

194
00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:14,885
Pakunoda: HAS THE OTHER
NEW ADDITION ARRIVED YET?

195
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:18,018
Shalnark: DON'T KNOW.
YOU SHOULD ASK MACHI.

196
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:21,485
( somber chorus vocalizing )

197
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:48,985
Dalzollene: THIS IS
FOR SEPTEMBER.

198
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,852
Neon: WHAT'S THIS?
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT.

199
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:53,452
Dalzollene: IT IS.

200
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:57,385
BOTH MR. TRINK AND MR. ROTTFELLI
WOULD LIKE THEIR FORTUNES TOLD.

201
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,318
Neon: AWW! THAT SUCKS.

202
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:03,525
I TOLD YOU I WAS GONNA QUIT
IF YOU ADDED ANY MORE.

203
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,358
Dalzollene: AND I DO APOLOGIZE.

204
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:09,058
YOUR FATHER COUNTS THEM BOTH
AMONG HIS CLOSEST ASSOCIATES.

205
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,892
Neon: WELL,
WHERE IS PAPA, ANYWAY?

206
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:15,158
Dalzollene: HE HAD A VERY
PRESSING MEETING TO ATTEND TO.

207
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:18,025
Neon: HE'S PROBABLY OFF HUNTING
OR PLAYING GOLF.

208
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:20,292
( phone line rings, clicks )

209
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:22,192
PAPA? THIS IS NEON.

210
00:13:23,558 --> 00:13:24,692
WHAT?! NO WAY!

211
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:26,692
YOU CAN'T FOOL ME THAT EASILY!

212
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,492
NO. NO!

213
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:32,658
HMM? ( sighs )

214
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:34,225
FINE, IF YOU KEEP YOUR WORD,

215
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:37,492
BUT BREAK ONE MORE PROMISE,
AND I'LL QUIT FOR REAL.

216
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,558
( beep )

217
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:40,192
HOORAY!

218
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:42,492
I'M GETTING
ANOTHER PIECE OF TREASURE!

219
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:44,992
HEE HEE. SWEET DEAL, HUH?

220
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,992
Dalzollene:
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

221
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,025
Neon: 'KAY.
NOW THAT THAT'S SETTLED,

222
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,892
I'LL GET THIS OVER WITH.

223
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:54,292
( chorus vocalizing )

224
00:14:15,632 --> 00:14:16,898
Dalzollene: HMM.

225
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:20,732
Basho: I HEARD SOMEWHERE

226
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:22,965
THAT SHE'S
AN INCREDIBLE FORTUNETELLER.

227
00:14:22,998 --> 00:14:25,565
THANKS TO
HER FATHER'S CONNECTIONS,

228
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,865
SHE'S GOT SOME V. I. P. CLIENTS
IN THE UNDERWORLD.

229
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:31,398
Kurapika: YOU HAVE IT BACKWARDS.

230
00:14:31,465 --> 00:14:32,965
Basho: THAT SO?

231
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,232
Kurapika: I'D SAY THAT
THE FATHER HAS USED HIS DAUGHTER

232
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:39,832
TO INCREASE HIS STANDING
AND MOVE UP IN THE UNDERWORLD,

233
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:42,565
AND THAT'S WHY
THE PROSPECT OF LOSING HER

234
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:44,732
IS SO FRIGHTENING TO HIM.

235
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,832
HE'S AFRAID HIS ENEMIES
MIGHT RETALIATE

236
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,865
BY TARGETING HIS DAUGHTER.

237
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,665
Neon: OKAY, ALL DONE.

238
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:53,665
HERE.

239
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:55,232
Dalzollene: EXCELLENT WORK.

240
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:58,865
Neon: TOMORROW'S AUCTION
STARTS AT NIGHT, DOESN'T IT?

241
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,732
I WANT TO GO SHOPPING
BEFOREHAND.

242
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:04,072
Dalzollene: IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT, I SHALL ACCOMPANY YOU.

243
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:19,972
Man: HOW MANY YEARS
HAS IT BEEN, I WONDER,

244
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:23,172
SINCE ALL 13 OF
THE TROUPE MEMBERS GOT TOGETHER?

245
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:24,538
FEITAN?

246
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:27,072
Feitan: THREE YEARS, TWO MONTHS,

247
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:30,072
BUT TWO HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN.

248
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,372
NUMBERS FOUR AND EIGHT
ARE DIFFERENT.

249
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:37,572
Man #2: MACHI,
DO YOU THINK NUMBER FOUR,

250
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:39,572
HISOKA, WILL ACTUALLY SHOW UP?

251
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,672
Machi: NO IDEA. DON'T ASK ME.

252
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:44,672
Man #2: WASN'T HE
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY?

253
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:46,738
Machi: I JUST TOLD HIM
TO BE HERE.

254
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:49,472
Feitan: I DON'T LIKE HISOKA.

255
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:52,905
WHY DOES THE BOSS
LET HIM DO AS HE PLEASES?

256
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:54,905
Man #1: FOR HIS SKILLS,
PROBABLY.

257
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:56,572
( Feitan scoffs ) SKILLS?

258
00:15:56,572 --> 00:16:00,038
Man #1: WELL, HIS BUNGEE GUM
IS CERTAINLY VERY IMPRESSIVE.

259
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:02,578
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT
FOR ANYONE TO COUNTER.

260
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:07,812
Feitan: ARE YOU SAYING THAT
THE BOSS IS AFRAID OF HISOKA?

261
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:09,012
WATCH YOURSELF.

262
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:11,478
Man #1: THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

263
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,012
Man #2: QUIT BEING GENEROUS.

264
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:15,678
YOU'RE GIVING THE GUY
WAY TOO MUCH CREDIT.

265
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:16,745
( man #1 scoffs )

266
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:19,078
TALK IS AS CHEAP
AS IT EVER WAS.

267
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:32,678
Man #2: SHUT UP, OR THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENS, NOBUNAGA.

268
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:36,478
Nobunaga: YOU WERE TALKING
JUST AS MUCH AS I WAS, FRANKLIN.

269
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,912
‐ Machi: HERE WE GO AGAIN.
‐ ( blows whooshing )

270
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:40,012
Feitan: IGNORE THEM.

271
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:42,678
THEY'RE JUST PLAYING AROUND.

272
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:44,912
Machi: SO, WHY IS THE CHIEF

273
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:46,878
CALLING EVERYONE TOGETHER,
ANYWAY?

274
00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:48,212
Feitan: WE'RE THIEVES.

275
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:51,745
I ASSUME HE WANTS US
TO STEAL SOMETHING.

276
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,978
Machi: WELL, THAT MUCH, I KNOW.

277
00:16:57,245 --> 00:17:01,085
Dalzollene: YES. WE'VE ARRIVED
SAFELY AT THE HOTEL,

278
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:04,252
BUT ONE OF THE YOUNG MISTRESS'S
FORTUNES CONCERNS ME.

279
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,752
"IN THE BASEMENT
WHERE PRICES RISE,

280
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,818
"YOUR BED SHALL BE MADE
WITH YOUR BROTHERS.

281
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:13,752
"DO NOT DESCEND STAIRS
YOU HAVE NEVER CLIMBED.

282
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:17,252
IN NUMBERS, DO NOT
COMPETE WITH OTHERS."

283
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:21,252
AND THERE ARE THREE OTHER POEMS
THAT BEGIN WITH THE SAME VERSE,

284
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:23,485
MEANING THAT ALL FOUR
OF THE CLIENTS

285
00:17:23,518 --> 00:17:25,685
RECEIVED FORTUNES
THAT ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL.

286
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:28,152
IT SEEMS THE ONLY THING
THAT CONNECTS THEM

287
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:30,585
IS THAT AT THIS YEAR'S
UNDERGROUND AUCTION,

288
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:33,018
EACH ONE OF THEM
WILL BE ATTENDING.

289
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:35,418
Man: SO THE FORTUNE SAYS

290
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:36,652
THEIR LIVES ARE AT RISK

291
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:38,752
SHOULD THEY CHOOSE
TO PARTICIPATE?

292
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:41,418
Dalzollene: I THINK
THE SLEEP IMAGERY

293
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:45,185
IS A METAPHOR FOR ILLNESS
OR FOR DEATH.

294
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:46,752
Man: UNDERSTOOD.

295
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:49,985
I WILL PASS THE FORTUNES
ALONG TO THE CLIENTS.

296
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:52,185
Dalzollene:
THERE'S ONE MORE THING, SIR.

297
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:54,585
THE YOUNG MISTRESS
IS NEVER ABLE TO REMEMBER

298
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:58,985
THE FORTUNES SHE'S TOLD,
AND SHE CANNOT TELL HER OWN.

299
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:02,758
DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO LET HER
TAKE PART IN THE AUCTION?

300
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:05,992
Man: NO!
BRING HER BACK IMMEDIATELY!

301
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:08,592
Dalzollene: HOWEVER,
WITHOUT A PROPER EXPLANATION,

302
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,692
SHE WON'T LISTEN
TO A WORD I SAY,

303
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:13,925
AND IF SHE THROWS A TANTRUM,
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP HER.

304
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:15,258
( Neon giggles )

305
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:18,992
Man: IN ANY CASE,
DO NOT TAKE HER TO THE AUCTION.

306
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:21,592
SEND SOME BODYGUARDS
TO PLACE THE BIDS INSTEAD.

307
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:23,225
Dalzollene: UNDERSTOOD.

308
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:25,425
( click )

309
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:26,925
( man sighs )

310
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,692
NEON.

311
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:33,858
( wind blowing )

312
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,925
( Phinks sighs )
HE ISN'T COMING.

313
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:41,525
Feitan: THE SUN IS ALMOST UP.

314
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:42,758
Uvo: DAMN IT, HISOKA.

315
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:45,825
NEXT TIME I SEE HIM,
I'LL TEAR HIM APART.

316
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:51,592
Hisoka: OH, DEAR.

317
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:55,358
THAT SOUNDS
QUITE GRUESOME, INDEED.

318
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:57,592
I'M SIMPLY TERRIFIED.

319
00:18:57,592 --> 00:18:59,092
Uvo: HISOKA! YOU BASTARD!

320
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:01,098
Shalnark: GUESS YOU'RE
RUNNING A BIT LATE.

321
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,698
Machi: I WAS STARTING
TO THINK YOU WOULDN'T SHOW.

322
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:05,898
Hisoka: WHY WOULDN'T I?

323
00:19:05,932 --> 00:19:08,098
YOU ASKED ME TO COME,
DIDN'T YOU?

324
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:12,198
HAD I BROKEN MY PROMISE,
I WOULD NEVER HAVE THE PLEASURE

325
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:15,198
OF SEEING
YOUR NEN STITCHES AGAIN.

326
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:16,265
( Machi scoffs )

327
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:18,432
Shalnark: OKAY, BOSS.
EVERYONE'S HERE!

328
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:23,065
♪

329
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:29,065
Uvo: WELL, BOSS,
WHAT ARE WE STEALING THIS TIME?

330
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:33,898
Boss: WE WILL TAKE THE TREASURES
OF THE UNDERGROUND AUCTION.

331
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:36,065
Shalnark: WHICH TREASURES
DO YOU WANT?

332
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:37,932
Machi: ANCIENT TEXTS, MAYBE?

333
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:39,898
THE BOSS DOES LIKE BOOKS.

334
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:42,532
Feitan: NO, BUT PERHAPS GAMES.

335
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:46,998
THERE WILL BE MANY COPIES
OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE GAME EVER.

336
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:48,998
Nobunaga: WOULDN'T IT
BE MORE LOGICAL

337
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:50,898
TO TAKE PRECIOUS METALS
AND GEMSTONES?

338
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:53,365
Boss: ALL OF IT.

339

349
00:20:28,537 --> 00:20:31,137
Hanzo: I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO KILL YOU,

350
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,170
AND I JUST CAN'T THINK
OF ANOTHER WAY

351
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:35,703
TO FORCE YOU TO SURRENDER,

352
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:38,870
SO I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES
IN THE NEXT ROUND.

353
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:43,337
Gon: WELL, I CAN'T ACCEPT THAT.

354
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,537
NO FAIR!

355
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:46,870
WE BOTH HAVE TO COME UP
WITH SOME WAY

356
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,937
THAT WE CAN HAVE A PROPER MATCH!

357
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,770
( Hanzo sighs )

358
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:52,537
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

359
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:54,670
YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU
WOULD NEVER SURRENDER,

360
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,170
SO WHAT THE HELL IS
THE POINT OF THAT, YOU IDIOT?!

361
00:20:57,203 --> 00:21:00,370
Gon: THE POINT IS THAT I DON'T
WANT TO WIN LIKE THIS, OKAY?!

362
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,710
Hanzo: THEN WHAT
DO YOU SUGGEST?!

363
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,943
Gon: LET'S WORK TOGETHER
AND FIGURE IT OUT!

364
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:05,177
( Hanzo growls )

365
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,877
SO IN OTHER WORDS,
I'VE ALREADY GIVEN UP THE MATCH,

366
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:11,377
BUT YOU WANT ME
TO CONTINUE FIGHTING

367
00:21:11,377 --> 00:21:13,110
AND TRY TO BEAT YOU AGAIN,
RIGHT?

368
00:21:13,143 --> 00:21:15,877
BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO WORK
TOGETHER TO FIND A WAY

369
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,943
YOU CAN WIN SO YOU CAN
FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOUR VICTORY.

370
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:19,943
IS THAT RIGHT?

371
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:21,043
Gon: YEAH!

372
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:22,777
Hanzo: MORON!

373
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:28,543
HEY, REFEREE, I LOSE,
SO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT MATCH.

374
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,877
Masta: UNDERSTOOD, SIR.

375
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:33,210
Hanzo: BUT I'D LIKE
TO SAY SOMETHING FIRST.

376
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:34,510
WHENEVER HE WAKES UP,

377
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,210
HE'LL PROBABLY DECLINE
HIS ADVANCEMENT.

378
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,443
AND AS WE'VE ALL SEEN,
HE CAN BE INCREDIBLY STUBBORN.

379
00:21:39,477 --> 00:21:43,543
ONLY ONE PERSON
FAILS THIS ROUND, RIGHT?

380
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,677
SO IF GON IS DISQUALIFIED,
WOULDN'T THAT RENDER

381
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,677
THE REST OF OUR UPCOMING FIGHTS
COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS?

382
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:58,443
Narrator:
WITH HANZO'S CONCESSION,

383
00:21:58,477 --> 00:22:01,817
GON'S VICTORY HAS BEEN ASSURED.

384
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,650
THE FINAL PHASE
THAT WILL DETERMINE

385
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:09,717
THE SINGLE FAILING APPLICANT
HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN.

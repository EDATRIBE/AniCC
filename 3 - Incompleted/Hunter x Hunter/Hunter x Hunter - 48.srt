00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:29,736
THE STATUE IS ROUGHLY CARVED
AND DOESN'T ADHERE TO ANY THEME.

175
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:32,536
I'D SAY IT'S
ONLY WORTH 1,500 JENNY.

176
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,136
( Killua scoffs )

177
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,536
( Gon thinking ) BUT THERE'S
A LITTLE AURA COMING FROM IT.

178
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,736
Dealer: NOW DON'T WORRY.

179
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:39,970
THAT'S JUST THE PRICE
AS AN ARTWORK,

180
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:43,403
BUT THE WOOD IT'S MADE OF
IS ACTUALLY QUITE VALUABLE.

181
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,536
Both: HUH?

182
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,170
Dealer: I WOULD BE
MORE THAN HAPPY

183
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:47,570
TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER ON IT.

184
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,036
SELL ME THE PAINTING
AND THE DOLL FOR 420,000,

185
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,903
AND I'LL THROW IN
ANOTHER 80,000 FOR THE WOOD.

186
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,403
Killua: SO 500,000 TOTAL?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

187
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,670
Dealer: THERE'S NO RUSH.
TAKE YOUR TIME,

188
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:02,643
BUT I DOUBT YOU'RE
GOING TO FIND A BETTER OFFER

189
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:03,910
FROM ANYONE ELSE AROUND HERE.

190
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,376
IN THE MEANTIME,
LET ME ANALYZE THIS

191
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,243
AND FIND OUT
THE EXACT AGE OF THE WOOD.

192
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,743
Man: STOP RIGHT THERE!

193
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:11,543
( boys gasp )

194
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:13,543
Man: PUT THAT STATUE DOWN NOW.

195
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:15,976
Dealer: I'M SORRY,
BUT WHO ARE YOU?

196
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,343
Man: WATCH OUT.

197
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:18,743
THIS GUY IS A SCAMMER.

198
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,143
THAT'S A FAIR PRICE
FOR THE DOLL AND PAINTING,

199
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:23,743
BUT HE'S LYING TO YOUR FACE
ABOUT THE STATUE.

200
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:26,643
Dealer: I‐I'M NOT LYING.
I SWEAR I'M NOT.

201
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,743
Man: YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

202
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:31,676
BECAUSE NO COLLECTOR
WOULD PAY 80,000 FOR THAT WOOD.

203
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,043
ALL YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
IS THE CONTENTS OF THAT STATUE!

204
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,576
( all gasp )

205
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,813
Man: THAT'S ACTUALLY
A WOODEN VAULT.

206
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,347
Boys: WAIT. ARE YOU SERIOUS?

207
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,180
Man: AROUND 300 YEARS AGO,
SECRET VAULTS LIKE THIS

208
00:09:55,213 --> 00:09:58,180
WERE A POPULAR WAY
FOR THE WEALTHY TO EVADE TAXES.

209
00:09:58,213 --> 00:09:59,747
Gon: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

210
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:01,187
Man: IF IT'S THE REAL DEAL,

211
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:04,120
THEN THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT
OF VALUABLE STUFFED INSIDE.

212
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:05,120
( boys gasp )

213
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:07,187
Man: YOU PLANNED
ON STEALING ITS CONTENTS

214
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:09,853
WHILE YOU WERE JUST PRETENDING
TO ANALYZE ITS AGE!

215
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,487
Dealer: NO!
NO, I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

216
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,587
Man #2: HOLD ON!

217
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,353
DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF AT ALL

218
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,687
THAT THAT THING'S
A GENUINE WOODEN VAULT?

219
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:19,587
Man #1: WHAT WAS THAT?

220
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,020
Dealer #2: IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS

221
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,453
THAT THE WOOD
IS OVER 300 YEARS OLD,

222
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:27,520
BUT ALL THAT TELLS US
IS THE AGE OF THE RAW MATERIAL.

223
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:30,187
IT COULD HAVE
BEEN CARVED RECENTLY.

224
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:34,020
THAT'S A DOCTORING METHOD
CALLED A FACE‐LIFT, BOYS.

225
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:35,620
Gon: A DOCTORING METHOD?

226
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:37,353
Man: HE MEANS
WHEN A COUNTERFEITER

227
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,320
TRIES TO TRICK
A PROFESSIONAL APPRAISER,

228
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:41,287
BUT THAT ISN'T WHAT I'M DOING.

229
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,287
AN AMATEUR WOULD NEVER RECOGNIZE
THIS SEAM HERE,

230
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,853
A SEAM WHICH CONTAINS
A TYPE OF GLUE

231
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:50,487
THAT WAS COMMONLY USED
IN THAT TIME PERIOD.

232
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,353
Dealer #2: YOU'RE INSISTING THIS
IS A REAL WOODEN VAULT, ARE YOU?

233
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,320
Man: YEAH.

234
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:57,920
Dealer #2: BUT IT'S POSSIBLE

235
00:10:57,953 --> 00:11:00,620
THAT IT'S BEEN OPENED,
THE CONTENTS SWAPPED OUT,

236
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:02,593
AND THEN THE STATUE
WAS REASSEMBLED,

237
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,993
SOMETHING WE CALL A TRANSPLANT.

238
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:07,293
WHEN A COUNTERFEITER
PERFORMS A TRANSPLANT,

239
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:11,327
THEY PUT A NEW COAT OF GLUE
ON TOP OF THE OLD ONE,

240
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,593
CREATING A SECONDARY SEAL,

241
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:16,327
BUT ONLY A RANK AMATEUR
WOULD EVEN THINK OF TRYING THAT.

242
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,360
A PRO WOULD MELT THE GLUE
WITH A FLAME,

243
00:11:20,427 --> 00:11:21,360
THEN RESEAL IT.

244
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:22,693
THAT WOULD MAKE IT LOOK

245
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:25,027
LIKE THE STATUE
HAD NEVER BEEN OPENED.

246
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:27,293
IT'S KNOWN AS CAUTERIZATION.

247
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:28,527
Gon: OH.

248
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:30,093
Man: IT'S NOT CAUTERIZED.

249
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:33,027
IF SOMEONE HAD USED A FLAME,
THE WOOD WOULD BE SCORCHED,

250
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,793
OR AT THE VERY LEAST,
THE GLUE WOULD BE DISCOLORED.

251
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:38,293
Dealer #2: EVEN PROS
WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME

252
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:39,093
SPOTTING THOSE DETAILS.

253
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:41,793
DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.

254
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,827
Man: I AM A PRO APPRAISER.

255
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,927
I SWEAR BY MY EYES
THIS IS A REAL WOODEN VAULT.

256
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,760
IT HAS NEVER BEEN OPENED,

257
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,460
AND THE TREASURE THAT'S INSIDE
HAS NEVER BEEN SWAPPED OUT.

258

JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT,

260
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:00,193
LET'S SAY IT IS
A GENUINE WOODEN VAULT.

SWAPPED OUT, WHAT'LL YOU DO?

THAT'S HOW MUCH YOU ESTIMATED
THIS TREASURE'S WORTH.

318
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:24,380
SO DO YOU THINK THAT'S
HOW MUCH WE COULD GET FOR IT

319
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,547
AT THE DEALERS' MARKET?

321
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:30,380
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
THEY DEAL MAINLY IN HARD CASH,

322

SO IF YOU SHOW UP EARLY ON,

323
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:34,713

THING IS WE'RE TRYING

340

00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,220
Zepile: OH.

342
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,220
Killua: SO WHY DID YOU
PICK THAT VASE?

343
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:17,220
Zepile: UH...

344
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:18,953
Killua: WELL, YOU KNEW
THAT WOODEN VAULT

345
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:20,387
WAS THE REAL THING, DIDN'T YOU?

346
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,220
SO YOU COULD'VE BID ON THAT,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

347
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,720
YOU BID ON THAT WEIRD VASE
INSTEAD. WHY?

348
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:28,887
( Zepile sighs )

349
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,287
WELL, YOU SEE...

350
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,720
I SORT OF MADE
THIS VASE MYSELF.

351
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:33,953
( both gasp )

352
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,153
Zepile: "SORT OF,"

353
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:37,820
BECAUSE IT ISN'T
MY ORIGINAL WORK.

354
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,220
THIS IS A KNOCKOFF.

355
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,953
IN OTHER WORDS,
IT'S COUNTERFEIT.

356
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:45,453
WHEN I WAS POOR, THIS WAS
HOW I MADE MY JENNY UNTIL...

357
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:49,020
I BECAME AN APPRAISER
AND STARTED EARNING MONEY.

358
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:52,020
AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENED,
I QUIT ALL THAT.

359
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:55,220
BUT WHEN I SEE HOW POORLY MADE
THESE THINGS ARE,

360
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,053
OH, BOY,
IT'S REALLY EMBARRASSING.

361
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,287
I SWORE I'D BUY THEM BACK

362
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,727
WHENEVER I SAW THEM
AT THE MARKET.

363
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:05,960
Killua: ANY CLUE
WHAT A REAL ONE WOULD COST?

364
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,793

YOUR DAD DO FOR A LIVING?

366
00:16:10,193 --> 00:16:11,493
Gon: HE'S A PROFESSIONAL HUNTER.

367
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:14,560
Killua: I ASKED HOW MUCH
A REAL ONE WOULD COST!

368
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,727

Zepile: IS THAT SO?
A PRO HUNTER, HUH?

371
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:22,460
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THEM
IN THE ANTIQUES COMMUNITY,

372
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:26,060
AND NOT ONE OF 'EM IS SOMEONE
YOU WOULD DESCRIBE AS NORMAL.

373
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,660

FOR YOU TO FIND HIM ON YOUR OWN?

374
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:32,960
Gon: WE'LL BE FINE.
SEE, I'M A PRO HUNTER MYSELF.

375
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,560
Zepile: WAIT. REALLY?!

376
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,727
Gon: 'KAY. IT'S YOUR TURN
TO ASK US A QUESTION NOW.

377
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,393
Zepile: HMM.

378
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:43,727
RIGHT. THIS ONE'LL BE
MY FINAL QUESTION.

379
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:46,960
IS THERE ANYTHING AT ALL
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

380
00:16:46,993 --> 00:16:48,293
‐ ( Gon gasps )
‐ Killua: HUH?

381
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:50,827
Zepile: IF YOU WANT
TO MAKE MONEY AT AN AUCTION,

382
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,560
YOU'LL NEED SOMEONE
WITH APPRAISAL EXPERIENCE.

383
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,993
YOU COULD SAY THAT TEAMING UP
WITH THE RIGHT APPRAISER

384
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:58,227
CAN GUARANTEE YOU
A PROFIT EVERY TIME.

385
00:16:58,293 --> 00:17:01,067
YOU CHOOSE HOW MUCH
YOU WANT TO PAY ME,

386
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,367
WHATEVER YOU THINK'S FAIR.

387
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,167
HOW'S THAT?

388
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,567
Gon: FINE. THEN YOU HAVE
TO ANSWER OUR LAST QUESTION.

389
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,533
WHAT MADE YOU
WANT TO HELP US OUT?

390
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,066
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?

391
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,100
( Zepile chuckles )

392
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,933
IT JUST MADE ME HAPPY.

393
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:18,933
( both gasp )

394
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:19,866
Zepile: FELT NICE

395
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,733
THAT SOMEONE
WAS BIDDING ON MY WORK,

396
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:24,400
EVEN IF IT IS
JUST A WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK.

397
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,266
Gon: IT IS NOT A PIECE OF JUNK!

398
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,566
‐ Zepile: HUH?
‐ Gon: THAT VASE YOU MADE,

399
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,900
IT'S OVERFLOWING
WITH YOUR NEN, MR. ZEPILE!

400
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,933
AURA'S COMMON,
AND ANYBODY CAN PRODUCE IT,

401
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,900
BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT
TO CONTROL, LIKE, REALLY HARD!

402
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,600
YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE AND
TRAIN FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

403
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,433
ANYBODY CAN SEE HOW MUCH EFFORT
YOU PUT INTO MAKING THAT VASE.

404
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:47,100
I KNOW I SURE CAN.

405
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
THIS KIND OF WORK TAKES TALENT.

406
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,600
AND I'M SORRY FOR SAYING
IT WAS WEIRD EARLIER.

407

408
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,233
( Zepile sighs )
I CAN TRUST MY EYES.

409
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,533
THEY'VE NEVER FOOLED ME.

410
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:02,173
WHEN YOU APPRAISE THINGS
LONG ENOUGH,

411
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,206
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT BECOME
A GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

412
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,906
I LOOK AT THE SELLERS AND
THE BUYERS, NOT JUST THE GOODS.

413
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,906
IF THERE'S
ONE THING I'VE LEARNED

414
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,540
AFTER ALL THIS TIME
APPRAISING ANTIQUES,

415
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:17,773
IT'S THAT IT'S A LOT HARDER
TO APPRAISE PEOPLE,

416
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,606
AND WHEN I SAW YOU,

417
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:22,406
THE APPRAISER IN ME
KNEW RIGHT AWAY

418
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,773
THAT I REALLY WANTED
TO WORK WITH YOU, TRULY.

419
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,073

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,773
Gon: CAN YOU TEACH ME
THE DOCTORING METHODS

426
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,706
YOU TALKED ABOUT
IN THE STORE EARLIER?

AND TRANSPLANT AND FACE‐LIFT.

429
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,406
IS THAT IT, OR ARE THERE OTHERS?

430
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,606

YOU'RE NOT HERE TO HAVE FUN!

Zepile: I THINK I GET IT NOW,
WHY THIS KID INTRIGUED ME.

435
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:12,613
HE'S NOT CONCERNED WITH WHETHER
SOMETHING IS GOOD OR BAD.

436
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:16,213
WHEN I CAME CLEAN
ABOUT MAKING COUNTERFEITS

437
00:19:16,246 --> 00:19:20,413
OR WHEN THE MEN IN THE STORE
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE VAULT,

438
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:23,013
I DIDN'T SEE
A HINT OF DISAPPROVAL

439
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:25,780
OR GREED ON HIS FACE, NOT ONE,

440
00:19:25,846 --> 00:19:31,213
BUT WHAT I DID SEE
WAS PURE CURIOSITY.

441
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:33,013
IF SOMETHING IMPRESSES HIM,

442
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,013
HE DOESN'T START JUDGING
WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD,

443
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:40,213
WHICH MEANS
HE'S WALKING A FINE LINE.

444
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,780
HE'S THAT RARE KIND OF PERSON

445
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:46,346
WHO CAN NEVER
TRULY BE APPRAISED.

446
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:50,713
CAUTERIZATION,

447
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:54,013
DEFINITELY THE HARDEST
DOCTORING METHOD TO DETECT.

448
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:59,446
BUT NOT TOO LONG AGO,
A NEW METHOD SURFACED.

449
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:01,286
IT'S CALLED AN AUTOPSY.

450
00:20:02,553 --> 00:20:05,653
THAT'S WHEN YOU PLAINLY REVEAL
THE OPENED STATUE

451
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:07,720
ALONG WITH A FAKE TREASURE.

452
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:10,220
IT'S BASED
ON MOST PEOPLE'S ASSUMPTION

453
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
THAT YOU WOULDN'T OPEN
THE STATUE

454
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:13,786
IF THE TREASURE WERE FAKE,

455
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,353
AND THAT MAKES THEM
EASY TO FOOL.

456
00:20:16,386 --> 00:20:19,553
BUT THIS METHOD
IS STARTING TO GET OLD NOW.

457
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,620
PEOPLE WERE GETTING SUSPICIOUS,

458
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,553
SO OF COURSE
A NEW DOCTORING METHOD EMERGED.

459
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:27,353
THINK YOU CAN GUESS?
GIVE IT A TRY.

460
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:29,386
Gon: OH, I KNOW!
THE STATUE'S FAKE,

461
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:31,653
AND THE TREASURE
INSIDE OF IT'S FAKE, TOO!

00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:36,853
YOU TAKE THE TREASURE OUT
FROM A DIFFERENT OPENING.

00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:38,353
Zepile: BINGO.

466
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:42,053
YOU START
BY CREATING A NEW OPENING

467
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:43,653
AND REMOVING THE TREASURE.

468
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:45,886
THEN YOU JUST INSERT
THE FAKE TREASURE

469
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:48,553
AND CAREFULLY SEAL
THE HOLE BACK UP AGAIN.

470
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,453
THAT'S KNOWN AS AN OSTOMY.

471
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:52,120
Gon: AN OSTOMY.

Zepile: MANY VETERAN APPRAISERS
HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY IT.

IF THERE ARE NO SIGNS
THAT THE ADHESIVE

474

I THINK I GET IT.

172
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:13,865
SO THERE'S ANOTHER KIND
OF AUCTIONING.

173
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,532
( chuckles )

174
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:19,298
Dalzollene: AT 9:00 TONIGHT,
THE MUMMY OF PRINCESS CORCO

175
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,032
WILL BE SOLD OFF
AT THE UNDERGROUND AUCTION.

176
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:25,198
IVLENKOV, TOCINO, AND BAISE,

177
00:08:25,232 --> 00:08:27,232
YOU'LL BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE BIDDING.

178
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,532
Basho: ARE THREE PEOPLE
GONNA BE ENOUGH?

179
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:32,532
Dalzollene: BUYERS CAN
ONLY ENTER IN GROUPS OF THREE.

180
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:35,498
WEAPONS, COMMUNICATION
AND RECORDING DEVICES

181
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:37,132
ARE ALL STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.

182
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:40,065
THE MAFIA THAT RUNS
THE UNDERGROUND AUCTION

183
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:44,132
ALSO HANDLES SECURITY,
SO THERE'S RARELY ANY TROUBLE.

184
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:47,365
ALL IT TAKES IS
ONE MISCALCULATED MOVE,

185
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:52,032
AND THEN EVERY MAFIA MEMBER
IN THE WORLD BECOMES YOUR ENEMY.

186
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,732
THIS AUCTION IS BUILT
ON A FOUNDATION OF TRUST,

187
00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:57,198
AND THAT'S THE REASON

188
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,865
YOU WON'T SEE ANY
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS ON‐SITE.

189
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,238
THE ONE UNSPOKEN RULE

190
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:05,172
IS THAT ANY GRUDGES
ARE TO BE CHECKED AT THE DOOR.

191
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:09,038
AND SO IF ANYTHING DOES HAPPEN,

192
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,538
YOUR WORD
IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE.

193
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:13,038
THERE ARE NO COURTS HERE,

194
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:16,338
BUT IT WILL HOLD THE SAME WEIGHT
AS SWORN TESTIMONY.

195
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:20,205
IT'S CRUCIAL THAT EACH ONE OF
YOU MAKES A GLOWING IMPRESSION.

196
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:23,205
DON'T CAUSE MINOR DISTURBANCES
FOR ANY REASON.

197
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:26,838
SPEAK TO NO ONE
OUTSIDE OF THIS GROUP.

198
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:28,972
Basho: AND THE REST OF US?

199
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,838
Dalzollene: BASHO AND LINSSEN

200
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:32,638
WILL BE COVERING
THE REAR ENTRANCE.

201
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,838
KURAPIKA AND MELODY
WILL TAKE THE FRONT ENTRANCE.

202
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:40,738

WHEN YOU WALKED PAST ME.

342
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,216
YOUR HEART PLAYED
A MELODY OF WRATH.

343
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,183
MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

344
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:33,949
Kurapika: GO AHEAD.

345
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:35,549
Melody: SCARLET EYES.

346
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,616
( Kurapika gasps )

347
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:38,716
Melody: EXACTLY...

348
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:40,783
WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO YOU?

349
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:42,949
( siren passing )

350
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:46,416
Kurapika: WHY DO YOU ASK?

351
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:49,616
Melody: THERE'S NO REASON
IN PARTICULAR.

352
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:51,416
JUST CURIOUS.

353
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:54,616
WHEN YOU SAW
THE IMAGE ON THE DATA CARD,

354
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:58,116
YOUR HEARTBEAT WAS EVEN
MORE FEARSOME THAN IT WAS THEN.

355
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:03,256
IT PLAYED A MELODY
OF BOUNDLESS FURY.

356
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:10,956
Kurapika: I GUESS
THERE'S NO POINT IN LYING.

357
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:15,123
I AM A MEMBER OF THE KURTA CLAN.

358
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:17,289
OUR EYES ARE NORMALLY BROWN,

359
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:20,456
BUT THEY BURN A BRIGHT CRIMSON
WHEN WE'RE AGITATED,

360
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:25,023
SO I WEAR BLACK CONTACT LENSES
TO ESCAPE DETECTION.

361
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:28,723
I SEEK THE EYES THAT WERE
STOLEN FROM MY BRETHREN,

362
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:33,356
AND WHATEVER IT TAKES, I WILL
RETURN THEIR EYES TO THEM.

363
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:37,356
Melody: HMM.

364
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:40,456
Kurapika: WILL YOU
TELL DALZOLLENE ABOUT ME?

365
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:43,256
Melody: NO, I WON'T,

366
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,356
BECAUSE YOU'D KILL ME IF I DID.

367
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:47,223
Kurapika:
YOU'RE VERY PERCEPTIVE.

368
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,789
Melody: A HEARTBEAT'S
ALWAYS HONEST.

369
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:54,123
WHEN YOU FIRST BEGAN CONFESSING
AND TOLD ME YOUR TRUE NATURE,

370
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:57,389
YOUR HEARTBEAT WAS AS CALM
AS IT WAS ICY,

371
00:18:57,423 --> 00:19:01,963
THE HEARTBEAT OF ONE WHO IS
PREPARED TO KILL IF NEED BE.

372
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:06,263
YOUR HEART SAYS
YOU HOLD NO GRUDGES,

373
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:09,129
BUT THAT I WAS FAIR GAME
IF I TALKED.

374
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:13,096
Kurapika:
WHY DID YOU TAKE THIS JOB?

375
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:14,963
Melody: WHY WOULD YOU ASK?

376
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,529
YOU KNOW THAT I'LL
PROBABLY LIE TO YOU.

377
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:21,963
Kurapika: YOUR EYES
WILL TELL ME IF YOU DO.

378
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,463
( Melody sighs )

379
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:28,629
I'M ALSO A PRO HUNTER,

380
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:31,796
A MUSIC HUNTER, I SUPPOSE.

381
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:35,363
I SEEK A CERTAIN SHEET MUSIC.

382
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:41,429
Kurapika: YOU AREN'T LYING,

383
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,729
BUT YOU LEFT OUT
CRUCIAL DETAILS.

384
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:46,196
( Melody chuckles )
LET'S SAY YOU'RE RIGHT

385
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:48,129
AND LEAVE IT AT THAT.

386
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:52,229
( flute playing )

387
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:54,396
IT'S THE SONATA OF DARKNESS.

388
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:56,129
THAT'S WHAT I'M AFTER.

389
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:02,903
IT IS SAID TO BE COMPOSED
BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF.

390
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:04,169
THERE ARE SOLO PARTS

391
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,403
FOR THE PIANO, VIOLIN,
FLUTE, AND HARP.

392
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:10,903
IF A HUMAN PLAYS
OR EVEN LISTENS TO THE PIECE,

393
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:13,336
THEY WILL BE HORRIBLY CURSED.

394
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:17,969
Kurapika: ISN'T THAT
JUST AN URBAN LEGEND?

395
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:21,536
I DOUBT THAT ANYTHING LIKE THAT
COULD TRULY EXIST.

396
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:30,969
( gasps )

397
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:38,003
Melody: THE ONLY SOLO I HEARD
WAS THE FLUTE SOLO.

398
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,169
ONE MOVEMENT TURNED ME
INTO WHAT YOU SEE NOW.

399
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:43,303
MY FRIEND WHO PLAYED IT DIED,

400
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:46,169
AND HER WHOLE BODY
TURNED TO THIS.

401
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,069
JUST A SINGLE MOVEMENT FROM
SOMEONE WHO HAD GIVEN WARNINGS

402
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:53,903
NEVER TO PLAY IT
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

403
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:57,369
THAT DAY,
WE WERE DRUNK AND GIDDY.

404
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:03,143
MY BODY WAS DESTROYED, BUT I
GAINED THIS ABILITY IN RETURN.

405
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:06,876
I WISH TO RESTORE MY BODY
TO THE WAY IT WAS.

406
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:10,209
I'M WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.

407
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:14,209
I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE
TO SUFFER THE SAME FATE AS ME.

408
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:18,076
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO FIND
THE SCORE AND DESTROY IT.

409
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:22,043
YOU ASKED ME
WHY I TOOK THIS JOB.

410
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:26,743
THE ANSWER IS I WAS HOPING
ONE DEVIL WOULD KNOW ANOTHER.

SO IT COMES WITH THE TERRITORY.

176
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:24,585
All: YOU'VE TRIED 35 TIMES?

177
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:27,785
Applicant #16: I GUESS YOU COULD
SAY I'M A HUNTER EXAM VETERAN.

178
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:30,385
Leorio: NOT REALLY
SOMETHING TO BRAG ABOUT.

179
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:32,385
Kurapika: INDEED.

180
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:34,018
Applicant #16: ANYWAY,
IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS,

181
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:35,351
I'D BE HAPPY TO HELP.

182
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:36,751
Gon: THANKS A LOT!

183
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,618
Applicant #16: OH, BY THE WAY,
THE NAME'S TONPA.

184
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:39,785
Gon: HI. I'M GON.

185
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:42,718
THIS IS KURAPIKA,
AND THIS IS LEORIO.

186
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,851
YOU SURE
HAVE TAKEN THE EXAM A LOT.

187
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,785
ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE HERE
WHO'S TRIED A BUNCH OF TIMES,

188
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:49,785
OR ARE THERE OTHERS?

189
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:51,718
Tonpa: I MIGHT HOLD THE RECORD,

190
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:53,351
BUT, YEAH, THERE ARE OTHERS,

191
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,418
FOR INSTANCE,
THAT GUY OVER THERE,

192
00:09:56,451 --> 00:10:00,418
NUMBER 255, TODO THE WRESTLER.

193
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:04,558
PROBABLY THE STRONGEST ONE HERE,
AND HE'S SMARTER THAN HE LOOKS.

194
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:08,225
OVER THERE IS 103,
BOURBON THE SNAKE CHARMER.

195
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,225
HE CAN REALLY HOLD A GRUDGE,

196
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,391
SO TRY NOT TO GET
ON HIS BAD SIDE.

197
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,791
‐ ( snake hisses )
‐ Tonpa: LET'S SEE NOW.

198
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,658
NUMBER 191,
BODORO THE KUNG FU MASTER.

199
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:21,358
HE'S GETTING OLD, BUT HE'S STILL
THE BEST MARTIAL ARTIST AROUND.

200
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:25,291
THEN THERE ARE THE BROTHERS,
AMORI, IMORI, AND UMORI.

201
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,191
THEY WORK GREAT AS A TEAM,

202
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:29,325
SO THEY ALMOST
ALWAYS DO REALLY WELL.

203
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:33,558
AND 384, GERETTA THE HUNTSMAN.

204
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,358
HE SPECIALIZES IN KILLING
ALL KINDS OF CREATURES

205
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,325
WITH HIS BLOW DART AND CLUB.

206
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:42,158
THERE ARE MORE, BUT THEY'VE
TAKEN THE EXAM THE MOST TIMES.

207
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:44,325
Gon: OH, WOW!

208
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:55,625
( man shrieking )

209
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:57,658
( applicants murmuring )

210
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:09,498
Applicant #44: MY, HOW UNUSUAL.

211
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:13,198
SEEMS THIS POOR MAN'S ARMS
HAVE TURNED INTO FLOWER PETALS.

212
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:16,631
NOW YOU SEE THEM.
NOW YOU DON'T.

213
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:18,631
( Gon gasps )

214
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:21,231
Applicant #44:
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL,

215
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:24,631
AND DO APOLOGIZE
IF YOU BUMP INTO SOMEONE.

216
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:27,198
( applicants muttering )

217
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:29,865
Tonpa: JUST PERFECT.
THE PSYCHOPATH IS BACK AGAIN.

218
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,631
Gon: YOU KNOW THAT GUY?

219
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:34,565
Kurapika: SO DOES THAT MEAN
HE TRIED LAST YEAR?

220
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:38,165
Tonpa: NUMBER 44,
HISOKA THE MAGICIAN.

221
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,465
HE WAS THE NUMBER ONE PICK
TO PASS LAST YEAR'S EXAM

222
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:42,665
UNTIL HE ALMOST KILLED

223
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:44,631
AN EXAMINER
HE DIDN'T APPROVE OF.

224
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:46,831
Leorio: THEN WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING HERE?!

225
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:48,498
THEY'RE LETTING HIM
RETAKE THE EXAM

226
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:49,798
AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT?!

227
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:51,798
Tonpa: OF COURSE THEY ARE.

228
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:54,565
THEY CHANGE THE CONTENT
AND EXAMINERS EVERY YEAR,

229
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,398
AND THE EXAMINERS
CHOOSE THE NEW MATERIAL.

230
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:01,371
THE DEVIL HIMSELF
COULD PASS THE HUNTER EXAM

231
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:03,405
IF THE EXAMINERS SAY IT'S OKAY.

232
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,538
IT'S HOW THE WHOLE THING WORKS.

233
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:08,805
ANYWAY, NOBODY LIKES THE GUY.

234
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:11,571
I'D KEEP MY DISTANCE
IF I WERE YOU.

235
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:15,571
Leorio: WELL, HE DEFINITELY
LOOKS DANGEROUS.

236
00:12:15,638 --> 00:12:18,171
Tonpa: OH! I ALMOST FORGOT!

237
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,338
LET'S HAVE A TOAST
TO FRIENDSHIP.

238
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:21,471
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

239
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:22,471
Leorio: HEY, THANKS!

240
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:24,371
YEAH, DON'T MIND IF I DO!

241
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,671
AH, I WAS DYING OF THIRST.

242
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,671
THANKS A LOT, BUDDY.

243
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:30,338
Gon: YEAH, THANKS A LOT.

244
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:31,338
Kurapika: THANK YOU.

245
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:32,338
( applicant #157 chuckles )

246
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:33,638
WELL, THERE HE GOES.

247
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,471
Second applicant:
PLAYING THE NICE GUY AGAIN,

248
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,338
EVEN THOUGH
HE'S THE NASTIEST ONE HERE.

249
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:39,805
Third applicant:
TONPA, THE ROOKIE CRUSHER.

250
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:43,305
Tonpa: HERE'S TO NEW FRIENDS
AND GOOD FORTUNE. CHEERS!

251
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:50,138
( chuckles )

252
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:51,538
( thinking )
SORRY, GUYS,

253
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:55,138
BUT THE JUICE I GAVE YOU
CONTAINS A POWERFUL LAXATIVE.

254
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:57,371
ONE SIP, AND YOUR GUTS WILL BE

255
00:12:57,405 --> 00:13:00,705
ON A NONSTOP ROLLER COASTER
FOR THREE DAYS.

256
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,011
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE EXAM,

257
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:05,145
I HOPE YOU BROUGHT
PLENTY OF DIAPERS.

258
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:09,145
( chuckles )

260
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:12,811
Leorio: HMM.

261
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,378

262
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:20,978

( Tonpa gasps )

268
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:33,045
Gon: I THINK THIS JUICE
MIGHT'VE GONE BAD,

269
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,545
MR. TONPA. IT TASTES FUNNY

270
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:37,411
Leorio: SERIOUSLY?

271
00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:38,978
THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL.

272
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:40,545
Tonpa: HUH? THAT'S ODD.

273
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:42,478
REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT, FELLAS.

274
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:44,645
( thinking )
IMPOSSIBLE.

275
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:47,478
THAT LAXATIVE IS
FLAVORLESS AND ODORLESS.

276
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,911
PLEASE FORGIVE ME!

277
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,578
I HAD NO IDEA THE JUICE WAS BAD!

278
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:56,911
Gon: YOU DON'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

279
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:59,411
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
IS YOUR STOMACH OKAY?

280
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:02,151
Tonpa: I'M ALL RIGHT.
I'M TOTALLY FINE.

281
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:05,418
Gon: OH, GOOD. I'VE TRIED
ALL KINDS OF PLANTS AND GRASSES

282
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:07,251
ON THE MOUNTAIN BACK HOME,

283
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:09,985
SO I CAN USUALLY TASTE
WHEN SOMETHING'S BAD.

284
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:12,018
Tonpa: THAT'S SOME TALENT
YOU GOT THERE.

285
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,151
HEH HEH.
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.

286
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:15,385
( thinking )
DAMN IT.

287
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:18,351
HE JUST HAD TO BE
SOME WILD MOUNTAIN KID.

288
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:20,485
SORRY AGAIN.

289
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,485
I'LL SEE YOU BOYS AROUND.

290
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:25,351
Leorio: MAN, I THOUGHT
HE WOULD NEVER SHUT UP.

291
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:28,251
( Tonpa thinking )
SOMETHING ISN'T QUITE RIGHT

292
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:30,518
ABOUT THE CROP OF ROOKIES
THIS YEAR.

293
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:34,385
LIKE 294, HANZO.

294
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:37,151
THE FIRST TIME I TALKED TO HIM,

295
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:38,918
HE ACTUALLY SEEMED
PRETTY GULLIBLE.

296
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,018
Hanzo: KEEP THIS TO YOURSELF,

297
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:43,918
BUT I AM A NINJA.

298
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:45,518
Tonpa: WHOA, IS THAT SO?

299
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,518
Hanzo: I SEEK
THE LEGENDARY SCROLL.

300
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,518
SHH!

301
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,851
IT IS MY SECRET MISSION

302
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:53,151
TO TRACK DOWN
THE ULTIMATE NINJA SCROLL.

303
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:55,151
THAT'S WHY
I'M BECOMING A HUNTER.

304
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:57,385
RUMOR HAS IT
THAT IT'S HIDDEN SOMEWHERE

305
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,985
THAT'S INACCESSIBLE
TO ORDINARY PEOPLE.

306
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,925
ANYWAY, THIS PLACE
IS PRETTY BORING, HUH?

307
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:05,158
Tonpa: I GUESS SO.

308
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:07,091
HEY, WE SHOULD HAVE A TOAST.

309
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:09,091
TO FRIENDSHIP AND
GOOD FORTUNE, HUH?

310
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,025
Hanzo: I AM A SEASONED NINJA.

311
00:15:13,058 --> 00:15:14,558
I MAKE IT A POINT

312
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:17,558
NEVER TO DRINK ANYTHING
OFFERED TO ME BY ANOTHER.

313
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:20,558
YOU UNDERSTAND.

314
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:22,225
Tonpa: OH, RIGHT.

315
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:25,558
GOTCHA.
( nervous laugh )

316
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,025
( thinking )
I CAN TELL HE'S NO IDIOT.

317
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:31,558
ONE WRONG MOVE, AND I COULD'VE
BEEN IN SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE.

318
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:34,158
‐ ( rattling )
‐ EH?

319
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,325
( neck rattling )

320
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:38,158
SPEAKING OF TROUBLE,
THERE'S 301.

321
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:40,325
THAT GUY JUST OOZES DANGER.

322
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,825
I KNOW ONE THING.

323
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:43,525
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE NEAR HIM.

324
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:46,925
THEN THERE'S THE ONE
I REALLY CAN'T STAND,

325
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:50,925
107, NICOLAS.

326
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:56,325
MUST'VE BEEN TOUGH
TO MAKE IT THIS FAR, HUH?

327
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:58,025
Nicolas: NOT REALLY.

328
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,925
EVERYTHING'S GONE EXACTLY
AS MY DATA PREDICTED.

329
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:03,765
I USED HISTORICAL DATA
FROM PAST HUNTER EXAMS

330
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,331
TO CALCULATE
THIS YEAR'S LOCATION.

331
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,198
IT WAS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE

332
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:10,431
AND FRANKLY RATHER BORING.

333
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:12,165
Tonpa: OH. WELL, GOOD.

334
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:13,898
IMPRESSIVE WORK THERE, KID.

335
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,898
THE NAME'S TONPA.

336
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,898
IT'S REAL NICE TO MEET YOU.

337
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:19,031
Nicolas: TONPA, IS IT?

338
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,031
AH! THERE YOU ARE.

339
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:23,165
THIS IS YOUR 35th ATTEMPT,

340
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,831
THAT'S THE SECOND‐HIGHEST NUMBER
OF ATTEMPTS BY ANYONE.

341
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:29,331
BUT IT SAYS HERE THAT YOU
DO HOLD THE CURRENT RECORD

342
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:31,865
FOR THE MOST
CONSECUTIVE ATTEMPTS WITH 30.

343
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:33,165
THAT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

344
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,265
Tonpa: THANK YOU,
BUT IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

345
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:38,231
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

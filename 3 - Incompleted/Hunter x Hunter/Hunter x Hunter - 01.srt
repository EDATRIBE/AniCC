198
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:56,026

WANT TO BECOME HUNTERS?

199

Leorio: WHOA!
YOU'RE NOT AN EXAMINER,

200
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,759

201

THE QUESTION, DUMMY.

202
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:02,999
Gon: I WILL!

203
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,999
BECAUSE MY DAD IS A HUNTER!

204
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,533
Captain: HMM?

205
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:08,999
Gon: BEING A HUNTER WAS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

206
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:12,166
IN THE WORLD TO MY DAD,
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY.

207
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:13,933

208
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:16,633

WHALE ISLAND?

209
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,766

THIS IS GING'S SON.

HAS COME AT LAST.

IT'S NOT A SECRET.

GET WITH THE PROGRAM.

215
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:33,699
IT'S US VERSUS HIM,

216
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,966

DODGE THE QUESTION

222
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,966
BY SIMPLY OFFERING THE MAN
A PLAUSIBLE LIE?

223
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,499
Leorio: HEY, ARE YOU
EVEN LISTENING TO ME?!

224
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:54,166
Kurapika: HOWEVER, IT IS QUITE
SHAMEFUL TO RELY UPON DECEIT.

225
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,166
AS FOR ME, I CANNOT REVEAL
MY REASONS HERE.

226
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,099
I HAVE MY SHARE OF SECRETS,

227
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:02,706
DEEP SECRETS WHICH I DO NOT
INTEND TO EXPOSE AT THIS TIME.

228
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,706

I WILL NOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

229

REFUSE TO ANSWER MY QUESTION.

233
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,839
Captain: GET AHOLD
OF THE EXAM COMMITTEE FOR ME.

234
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:20,106
LET 'EM KNOW WE GOT
TWO MORE DROPOUTS.

235
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:21,139

236
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:23,106

237

Captain: STILL HAVEN'T
FIGURED IT OUT, HUH?

238
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,706

HAS ALREADY STARTED.

239

Both: IT HAS?

240
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:37,839
Captain: THERE ARE AS MANY
HUNTER WANNABES IN THIS WORLD

241
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:40,106
AS THERE ARE STARS IN THE SKY.

242
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:43,706
AND THE EXAMINERS, WELL,
FACT IS THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME

243
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:46,006
NOR THE RESOURCES
TO GO THROUGH 'EM ALL.

244
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:49,606
THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE LIKE ME
COME IN TO PICK UP THE SLACK,

245
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:52,006
SCREEN ALL OF THE APPLICANTS,
AND TRIM THE FAT.

246
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,539
I'VE ALREADY NOTIFIED
THE COMMITTEE

247
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,539
ABOUT THE REST OF THE LOT.

248
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:58,506
NOT A ONE OF 'EM MADE THE CUT.

249
00:14:58,539 --> 00:14:59,673
Leorio: WHAT?

250
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:01,546
Captain:
THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE STORM,

251
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:03,013
AND LOOK HOW THEY HANDLED IT.

252
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:05,713
THEY'D NEVER SURVIVE
THE LATER STAGES OF THE EXAM.

253
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,146
IN OTHER WORDS, THE ONLY WAY
YOU THREE ARE MOVING ON

254
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,713
TO THE NEXT PORTION OF THE EXAM
IS IF I GIVE YOU THE GO‐AHEAD.

255
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,813
SO I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN,

256
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:18,946
AND THINK CAREFULLY
BEFORE YOU ANSWER.

257
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:20,679

258

259
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:25,479
YOU COULD'VE
TOLD US THAT SOONER.

260
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:30,113
Kurapika: I AM THE SOLE SURVIVOR
OF THE KURTA CLAN.

261
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:35,113
FOUR YEARS AGO, MY ENTIRE CLAN

262
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:37,779
WAS ANNIHILATED
BY A BAND OF CRIMINALS.

263
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,613
THAT IS WHY I WANT
TO BECOME A HUNTER,

264
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:42,113
TO CAPTURE THE PHANTOM TROUPE.

265
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:46,213
Captain: SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT
TO BE A BLACK‐LIST HUNTER,

266
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,713
AND THE PHANTOM TROUPE
IS A CLASS‐A BOUNTY.

267
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:53,946
EVEN THE MOST SEASONED HUNTERS
CAN'T TOUCH 'EM.

268
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:57,613
YOU KNOW IT'S A SUICIDE MISSION,
RIGHT?

269
00:15:57,646 --> 00:16:00,153
Kurapika: DEATH IS
NOT AMONG MY FEARS,

270
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:04,019
BUT THERE IS ONE THING I DO FEAR
AND ONE THING ALONE,

271
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:07,653
THAT TIME WILL QUIET
THE RAGE IN MY HEART.

272
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:11,619
Leorio: SO IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE OUT FOR REVENGE.

273
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:13,619
YOU DON'T REALLY NEED
TO BECOME A HUNTER

274
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:16,019
JUST SO YOU CAN SETTLE
AN OLD SCORE, DO YOU?

275
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:18,019

THE STUPIDEST QUESTION

276

I HAVE EVER HEARD, LEORIO.

277
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:21,819
Leorio: THAT'S MR. LEORIO!

278
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,553
Kurapika: THERE ARE PLACES
ONLY HUNTERS CAN GO,

279
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,453
INTEL ONLY THEY CAN ACCESS,

280
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,986
ACTIONS ONLY THEY CAN TAKE.

281
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,019
THERE ARE MORE REASONS,
BUT THOSE ARE THE ONLY THREE

282
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:32,886
THAT YOU HAVE A CHANCE
OF COMPREHENDING.

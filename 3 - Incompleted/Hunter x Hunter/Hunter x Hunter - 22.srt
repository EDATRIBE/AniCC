THAT'S VERY PERCEPTIVE,

175
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:46,804
BUT THE FACT IS
YOU'RE ONLY ABOUT HALF RIGHT.

176
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:50,404
SEE, I DON'T NEED A KEY
TO GET INSIDE.

177
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:54,004
THIS KEY WAS SPECIALLY MADE
FOR INTRUDERS ONLY.

178
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:55,937
Leorio: THERE'S A KEY
FOR INTRUDERS?

179
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,837
Guard: ALMOST ALL OF THEM
GO RIGHT FOR THE FRONT GATE,

180
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:00,944
ABOUT 90%.

181
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,210
I COULDN'T BEGIN
TO TELL YOU WHY, THOUGH.

182
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:06,777
IF I DON'T OPEN THE GATE
FOR THEM,

183
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:10,710
EVERY TIME, WITHOUT FAIL,
THEY TRY TO BREAK IT DOWN.

184
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,444
THEY'RE REAL TROUBLEMAKERS,
THESE TYPES.

185
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,944
THAT'S WHY WE ADDED
A LOCKED DOOR TO ONE SIDE.

186
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:18,877
WORKS PRETTY WELL.

187
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,377
THEY JUST TAKE THE KEY

188
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,344
FROM THE POOR,
HELPLESS SECURITY GUARD,

189
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:24,010

I'M NOT A SECURITY GUARD.

I'M JUST THE JANITOR
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER MIKE.

Butler: THAT WAS
A SIMPLE RECORDING,

332
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:40,241
BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER WAYS
TO MIMIC SOMEONE'S VOICE.

333
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:44,208
NEXT, YOU'LL SAY
HE'D RECOGNIZE YOU BY SIGHT.

334
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:45,908
THERE AREN'T AS MANY METHODS

335
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:49,041
BY WHICH YOU COULD PERFECTLY
REPLICATE SOMEONE'S APPEARANCE,

336
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,908
BUT IT ISN'T IMPOSSIBLE.

337

TO APPROACH MASTER KILLUA

339

FOR SOME SINISTER MOTIVE.

340
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:04,248
AS LONG AS THAT THREAT EXISTS,
I CANNOT LET YOU MEET WITH HIM.

341
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:11,281
THE ZOLDYCK FAMILY ARE
IN THE ASSASSINATION BUSINESS.

342
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:13,948
THEY HAVE THEIR ENEMIES,
OF COURSE,

343
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:16,281

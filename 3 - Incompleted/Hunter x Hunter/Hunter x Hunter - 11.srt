176

TELL WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE.

177

YOU SEE.

LEADING HIM TO AVOID ANY ACTIONS
THAT INVOLVED OPENING UP.

199
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,626
SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S DOING EVERYTHING SHE CAN

200
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,960
TO MAKE HIM UNCOMFORTABLE
AND LESS LIKELY TO USE PAPER.

00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:47,266

HE'LL USE THE SAME PLAY
OR SOMETHING STRONGER

237

Killua: I SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING.

239
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,473
SHE'S TRYING TO GET LEORIO
TO CHOOSE EITHER ROCK OR PAPER.

240
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:36,906
Kurapika: CORRECT. USING PAPER
MEANS SHE'S CERTAIN NOT TO LOSE.

GOTTA STAY ONE STEP AHEAD!

AND PICKS SCISSORS.

345
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,384
YOU GET AN "A" FOR EFFORT.

346
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:52,384
( Gon gasps )

347
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:56,384
YOU'RE AMAZING, MR. NETERO,
REALLY AMAZING!

348
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:05,591
Killua: AH, FORGET IT. I QUIT.

349
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:07,591
‐ YOU BEAT ME, ALL RIGHT?
‐ Gon: HUH?

350
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:10,391
( Netero thinking )
OH? QUITTING ALREADY?

351
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,391
Gon: DON'T QUIT.
WE STILL GOT LOTS OF TIME,

352
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:16,391
AND BESIDES,
WE CAME SO CLOSE JUST NOW.

353
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:17,724
Killua: COME ON.

354
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:19,624
YOU'RE REALLY CLUELESS,
AREN'T YOU?

355
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:20,958
IT'S HOPELESS.

356
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:22,458
‐ Gon: HMM?
‐ Killua: THINK ABOUT IT.

357
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:25,191
THE OLD GUY'S BARELY USED
HIS RIGHT HAND OR LEFT LEG.

358
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:26,458
Gon: HUH?

359
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:28,591
Killua: HE'S WAY TOO POWERFUL
FOR US, GON.

360
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:31,091
WE COULD KEEP AT THIS
FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR

361
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:33,458
AND NEVER GET THAT BALL.

362
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:36,224
Netero: FIGURED IT OUT, DID YOU?

363
00:18:36,258 --> 00:18:39,191
AND HERE I WAS THINKING
I'D BEEN PRETTY SLICK ABOUT IT.

364
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:40,724
Gon: OH, I GET IT NOW.

365
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:44,124
Killua: HA HA HA! YOU SURE KNOW
HOW TO PISS ME OFF, OLD MAN.

366
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,591
LET'S GO, GON!

367
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,058
Gon: NAH. I THINK
I'M GONNA PLAY A LITTLE LONGER.

368
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:49,591
Killua: HUH?! ARE YOU DEAF?

369
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:51,458
DIDN'T YOU HEAR
WHAT I JUST SAID?

370
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:52,624
LOOK, IT'S POINTLESS!

371
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:54,524
YOU'LL NEVER
GET THE BALL FROM HIM!

372
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:56,591
Gon: IT'S OKAY,
'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY CARE.

373
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:58,624
WE'VE ONLY USED UP
HALF OF THE TIME LIMIT.

374
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:01,564
I'M GONNA SEE IF I CAN GET HIM
TO USE HIS RIGHT HAND

375
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,131
BEFORE THE REST OF IT
RUNS OUT.

376
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:05,464
( Killua stammers )

377
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:07,298
I SEE.

378
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:09,464
FINE. I GET IT.

379
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:11,298
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

380
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:13,098
I'M GOING TO BED.

381
00:19:16,631 --> 00:19:18,464

‐ Netero: HMM?

382
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:22,031
Gon: CAN YOU TELL ME HOW KILLUA
DID THAT THING HE DID,

383
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:23,431
YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WALKED SLOW

384
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:25,464
AND THEN THERE WERE
A BUNCH OF HIM?

385
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,098
Netero: THAT WAS A TECHNIQUE

386
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:30,698
USED BY THOSE ENGAGED
IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.

387
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:33,698
YOU HAVE NO NEED AT ALL
TO LEARN IT.

388
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:37,131
AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU SHOULD
NEVER TRY TO LEARN IT.

389
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:39,131
Gon: BUT IT'S
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE, HUH?

390
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:41,398
Netero: MM. IT REQUIRES
AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT

391
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,131
OF TRAINING TO MASTER IT.

392
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:46,131
Gon: OH, MAN, KILLUA REALLY
IS SOMETHING, ISN'T HE?

393
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:49,631
Netero: NICE TRY.

394
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:50,698

395
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:56,264

DAMN IT.

396
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:58,098
NOW I'M IN A BAD MOOD.

397
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,098

398
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,504

401

403
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:15,204
( Killua thinking )
IF I HADN'T STOPPED WHEN I DID,

404
00:20:15,238 --> 00:20:17,138
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE ENDED UP

405
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:19,638
KILLING THE OLD MAN
TO GET THE BALL.

406
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:26,638
Netero: HMM?

407
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:29,071
( thinking ) AH.
LOOKS LIKE MY LITTLE PLAYMATE

408
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:31,404
IS PICKING UP THE PACE A BIT.

409
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:34,971
NOW.

410
00:20:35,004 --> 00:20:37,004
HE'S FEINTING FOR THE BALL,

411
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,571
BUT HE'S REALLY
GOING FOR MY STOMACH! OH?

412
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,204
Gon: THAT HURT!

413
00:20:45,238 --> 00:20:47,004
ONE MORE!

414
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:51,071
( Netero thinking ) OHH.
IF HE HEAD‐BUTTS ME

415
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,404
IN THE STOMACH LIKE THAT AGAIN,
HE'LL SHATTER HIS SKULL.

416
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:59,004
BUT IF I RELAX MY MUSCLES,
HE MIGHT ACTUALLY LAY ME OUT.

417
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:00,411
HMM.

418
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:02,411
BEST TO AVOID THAT.

419
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:09,211
OHH. DID THAT KILL HIM?

420
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:14,578

427
00:21:23,644 --> 00:21:26,011

IS GOING ON HERE?!

347
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,043
AM I SEEING THINGS, OR HAS
KASTRO REALLY SPLIT IN TWO?

348
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:34,643
DID HE JUST CLONE HIMSELF?

349
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,043
KASTRO WENT FROM DISAPPEARING
TO MULTIPLYING!

350
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:39,910
DID HE HAVE A TWIN ALL ALONG?

351
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:43,643
Hisoka: I WONDER IF THIS IS
WHAT THEY CALL A DOPPELGANGER.

352
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,377
Kastros: INDEED IT IS.

353
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,977
Zushi: DID HE SAY,
"A DOPPELGANGER"?

354
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:51,443
Wing: YES.

355
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:53,477
Zushi: BUT, MASTER,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

356
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:55,110
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.

357
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,477
IT REFERS TO A DOUBLE,

358
00:18:57,543 --> 00:18:59,743
OR IN OTHER WORDS,
AN ADDITIONAL YOU.

359
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:03,217
WHEN YOU SPOT SOMEONE
WHO CLOSELY RESEMBLES YOU,

360
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,750
THAT IS CALLED A DOPPELGANGER.

361
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,217
Zushi: I'M SORRY, MASTER.

362
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,550
I STILL DON'T GET IT.

363
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,950
Wing: WHENEVER YOU
ENCOUNTER YOUR DOPPELGANGER,

364
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:13,083
YOU BEGIN TO EXPERIENCE
HEADACHES AND FATIGUE,

365
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:16,950
BOTH OF WHICH CONTINUE
UNTIL YOUR DOUBLE VANISHES.

366
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:19,483
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE
THAT THE DOUBLE

367
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,383
ACTUALLY SIPHONS ENERGY
AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL,

368
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:25,150
PROMPTING
THESE PHYSICAL REACTIONS.

369
00:19:25,217 --> 00:19:28,417
Zushi: BUT KASTRO ISN'T
SUFFERING AT ALL RIGHT NOW.

370
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,917
HE'S WAY TOO STRONG FOR THAT.

371
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,583
Wing: THAT'S ONLY
A STORY, ZUSHI.

372
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,083
IT'S CLEAR HE MASTERED THIS
THROUGH INTENSE TRAINING.

373
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:45,305
Hisoka: I DID AS YOU ADVISED

374
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:48,872
AND OBSERVED YOU
WITHOUT TRYING TO EVADE.

375
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:52,872
AND IT TURNS OUT
"VANISHED" WAS THE RIGHT WORD

376
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:55,772
FOR WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN DOING ALL ALONG.

377
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:59,372
BUT THEN, WHY COULDN'T I
SHAKE THE FEELING

378
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,545
THAT THERE WAS
SOMETHING MISSING BEFORE?

379
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:04,145
YOU VANISHED, YES,

380
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:07,145
BUT I STILL FELT
YOUR PRESENCE BY MY SIDE.

381
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:10,812
IN FACT,
JUST BEFORE YOU VANISHED,

382
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:13,345
I FELT EVEN MORE OF YOU.

383
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:18,145

YOU DUPLICATE YOURSELF.

385
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:22,812

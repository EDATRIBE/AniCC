00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:22,833
[OCULUS]
Number One:

2
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,291
Arbiters cannot stop
making judgments,

3
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,458
for this task is
more than their job.

4
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:31,625
It's the entire reason
for their existence.

00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,875
Number Two:

6
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,583
Arbiters cannot
experience death,

7
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,166
for that would taint
their judgments.

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,166
It would make them too
close to being human.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,208
Number Three:

10
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,250
Arbiters cannot feel emotions,

11
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,333
for doing so is not
in their natures.

12
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:52,041
It's impossible for a dummy
to have feelings, after all.

Not being able to judge someone?

[GINTI] Yeah, that's
right. Ever happened?

18

No.

19
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,250
Never to me.

Uh...

What is it?

22
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,125
Nothing. Just forget
about it, okay?

00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,000

Huh? Who's Quin?

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,916
Quindecim's former arbiter.
I guess you haven't met her yet.

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,791
The former you?

Thank you, Clavis.

which will in turn,

Perhaps it sounds odd,

while watching them
play the game.

116
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,666
I couldn't help but wonder
what they were thinking.

117
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,958
What are you even talking about?

118
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,625
Humans are complete
and utter idiots.

00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,958
You know that, right?

00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,416
Who gives a crap
what they're thinkin'?

121
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,916
It's not like it
actually matters to us.

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,291
We create extreme
conditions then sit back

123
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,791
and enjoy while they make
fools of themselves.

124
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,541
I disagree. I don't
see them as foolish.

125
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,041
Really?

126
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,666
That is correct. You see,
I have respect for people

127
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,375
who have lived a
fulfilling life.

128
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,791
[QUIN] Well, this one's
a little different.

[gasps]

130
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,666
[GINTI] Man, you're a
real idiot. Seriously!

131
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,958
If you ask me, you're--

132
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,166
Be quiet for a second, okay?

133
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,208
So, just by looking at
them, could you guess

134
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,291
what they were thinking?

135
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,458
No. I wasn't able
to do that, ma'am.

136
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,291
[NONA] Well, of course
you weren't able to.

137
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,833
You don't have the
experience for it.

138
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,333
Which is why I
told you to create

139
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,458
an extreme condition, by doing
so, you force the darkness

140
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,250
they harbor inside their
souls out into the light,

141
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,333
making it easier to judge them.

142
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,875
All right.

143
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,750
[NONA] The darkness of the soul
can take on many forms.

144
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,500
It can manifest as
the fear of death

145
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,916
or as a desperate
thirst for life.

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,958
Think of it as
foolish if you like.

147
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:51,333
Or respect it. Either way,
it's entirely up to you.

148
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,958
Every arbiter is different.

149
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,666
There should be more
than one way to judge.

150
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,708
At least in my opinion.

Well, anyway!

00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,541
It looks like it's time
for my going away speech.

154
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,458
I do have one or two words
of wisdom to pass on.

00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,000
As an old, experienced arbiter.

156
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,833
It doesn't matter what
it is, but make something

157
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,375

00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:34,166
Really? How am I supposed

168
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,791
I gotta say something, but what?

169
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:42,000

So, um, do you enjoy this, then?

170
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,208

Sorry?

171
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,958

172
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,208

Hobby?

00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,125
[WOMAN]
It's not?

174
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,625
You mean my work for
Nona? No, it isn't.

175
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,166

you treasure, right?

176
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,583
Yes.

00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,625
[WOMAN]
Huh.

178
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,541
[DECIM] If you want, there
are more I could show you.

179
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,083
[WOMAN]
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm!

180
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,416
[QUIN]
Glasses up, everyone. Cheers!

181
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,291
Ah!

182
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,958
[NONA]
Not doin' so well, are you?

183
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,125
And we know whose fault that is.

184
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,333
You mean me?

185
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,916
You're the one who said
I was better suited

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,208
to the information bureau.
It's why I let Decim take over.

187
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,958
What you didn't
tell me was how busy

188
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,541
things are in information.

189
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,458
Even being an
arbiter was better.

190
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,958
Condensing dead
peoples' memories

191
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,750
isn't as easy as it sounds.

192
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,500
[NONA]
Yeah. I know.

193
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,458
[QUIN] "I know"? What do
you mean, "I know"?

194
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,708
You've never done it before.

195
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,375
People are dying
too fast. Way too fast.

196
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,583
The rate is 7,000 an hour
now, did you know that?

197
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:45,416
Which works out to 116 a minute,
or roughly, two per second.

198
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,333
"Okay, you're dead."
"Okay, you're dead."

199
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,708
That's what it's like!

200
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,916
At that pace, it's impossible
to do our best work.

201
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,041
Yeah, I know.

202
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,625
Saying "I know"
over and over again

203
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:02,541
isn't very helpful. So, what's
the situation over there?

204
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,208
Not too great
right now, honestly.

205
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,208
[QUIN]
He is still new at it.

206
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:12,041
He doesn't even have any doubts
about judging yet, does he?

207
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,666
I can see it on your
face that I'm right.

208
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,208
I'm sure if
everything went well,

209
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,916
he could be a fascinating
arbiter someday,

210
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,333
but that is a lot to hope for.

211
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,583
I mean, come on.

212
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,666
Implanting human emotions
inside an arbiter?

213
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,125
Kinda crazy.

214
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,125
"Number Three:

215
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,541
Arbiters can't feel emotions,
for it's not in their natures.

216
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,250
A dummy can't have
feelings, after all."

217
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,166
Make sure old flower-head
doesn't find out.

218
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,875
[NONA]
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

219
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,833
[DECIM]
We're fairly busy.

220
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,708
Every day, many guests
come to receive

221
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,125
our judgments, correct?

222
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,416
[WOMAN]
Yeah.

223
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,625
And with each guest
comes a slew of memories.

224
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,541
Eventually, arbiters'
minds fill with them.

225
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,416
As you can imagine, that
poses an obstacle for us.

226
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,833
So, to address the issue,
arbiters are set up

227
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:04,875
to periodically forget the
accumulated guest memories.

228
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,916
After judgment,
guests no longer need

229
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,458
corporeal form, and their bodies
return to being dummies.

230
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,041
Normally, those dummies
are disposed of,

231
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,791
but I claim some
of them instead.

232
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,333
[WOMAN]
Why do that?

233
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,958
[DECIM] We're talking about
people who lived a full life.

234
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,541
I don't like that they end up
as if they never were.

235
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,791
It seems wrong to me somehow.

236
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,125
[gasps] Then all
those dummies--?

237
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,416
[DECIM] Yes. That's right.
They were all my guests.

238
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,875
All have visited Quindecim.

239
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,791
I chose to make dummies of them
so they would not be forgotten.

240
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,708
[gasps]

241
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,500
A pretty revolting
hobby, isn't it?

242
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,166
[WOMAN]
No, it turns out it's not.

243
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,041
[WOMAN]
Hey.

244
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,500
Why don't you let me
make it this time?

245
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,916
I don't know.

246
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,083
It'll be okay. Go on,
I've got this covered.

247
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,875
[DECIM sighs]

248
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,875
[GINTI]
I've had enough of this!

249
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,500
I'm sick of having
you here interfering

250
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,916
with my judgments!

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,833
Interfering? I'm not
doing anything.

252
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,666
'Cause of you,
everything around here's

253
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,250
turned upside down.

254
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,958
What do mean? How else
is it supposed to be?

255
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,458
[GINTI]
Not like this.

256
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,666
[MAYU] Force people to risk
their lives on stupid games

257
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,458
and things are gonna get crazy.

258
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,833
'Cause all humans are
complete idiots, right?

259
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,250
[MAYU sighs]
No, it's not that.

260
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,083
People generally look
out for number one,

261
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,625
that's just how it is.

262
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,458
If that's true,
then what's your story?

263
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,041
Say what now?

264
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,708
I don't really know what
you're getting at, sorry.

265
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,666
Why are none of you
people ever capable

266
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,875
of understanding your
own motivations?

267
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,208
[GINTI] I should just
drop you into the void.

268
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,958
Yeah? And what
was a void, again?

269
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:01,708
[GINTI grunts]

270
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,500
[MEMINE purrs]

271
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:08,125
[GINTI] Cozying up to her?
Traitorous feline!

272
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,916
[GINTI] Just being around
you gives me a headache.

273
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,541
[MAYU] Ah! Watch where you
put those hands, Mister!

274
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,500
[screams]

275
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,291
[MAYU] Jeez! That hurt!
What was that for, anyway?

276
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,666
[GINTI] She needs to get
out of here. Quickly.

277
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,375
[QUIN groans] There really is
something special about alcohol

278
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,708
from the living world,
isn't there?

279
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,291
So, why do you spend so mucha
your time and attention

280
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,125
on Decim, anyway?

281
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,750
A fair question.

282
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,833
The thing is, I think it's good
for there to be more than one

283
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:49,625
method of judging people,
but so many people die each day.

284
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,416
And we have to find a way
to judge them all somehow.

285
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,791
This is it. We work on
auto pilot. Mechanically,

286
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,333
no questions asked.

287
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,375
Then afterwards, what happens?

288
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,000
We forget everything about
the people we judged.

289
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,541
Because if we didn't,
we couldn't continue on

290
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,750
being arbiters.

291
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:15,250
We're not human. We are dummies.
We never live and we never die.

292
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:20,166
And yet we're built to look
exactly like those we judge.

293
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,583
Doesn't it seem strange
and kind of unfair?

294
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,208
We don't even know the first
thing about death or dying.

295
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,125
Yet we're the ones
who judge the dead.

296
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,500
Besides all that, I'm curious.

297
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,750
I'd like to see an arbiter
who has human emotions,

298
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,291
who can make human judgments.

299
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,333
[WOMAN]
Well, eat up.

300
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,875
[DECIM]
Thank you for cooking.

301
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:51,666
So, tell me some stories
about guests you've seen.

302
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,541
What were they like,
these people?

303
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,625
Let's say, the woman
playing the piano.

304
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,541
You remember her, right?

305
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,833
[DECIM]
No.

306
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,166
What?

307
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,000
What has been forgotten
stays forgotten.

308
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,083
It is just a hobby, then.

309
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:17,541
Aren't you even going to say
"it's good" or something?

310
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,750
I am terribly sorry.
The food is good.

311
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,000
How convincing.

312
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,541
Can't you muster
some enthusiasm?

313
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:28,708
[DECIM] Once again, I beg your
pardon. It is very delicious.

314
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,208
[WOMAN]
Uh...

315
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,250
[sighs]

316
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,666
Ah-ha, finally awake,
are we? Good morning.

317
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,125
[yells]

318
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,791
You know, you're adorable
even while you're sleeping.

319
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:49,250
I'm afraid poor Quin over there
can't say the same thing.

320
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,791
I've told you not to come
in here without asking!

321
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,250
Plus, watching me
sleep is creepy!

322
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,083
I had no choice but
to seek you out.

323
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,583
You haven't been spending
any time with me lately.

324
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,958
Wounds me to my core!

325
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,000
Go bother somebody else.
I told you, I'm busy.

326
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,541
[OCULUS]
You stickin' to that story?

327
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:09,833
'Cause you certainly don't
look busy to me. Unless...

328
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,041
...there's something you're
hiding from me, Nona?

329
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,166
Go away. Stupid geezer.

330
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,333
Aw, you're so mean!

331
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,208
Hello.

332
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:26,500
[OCULUS] And what do we
have here? "Chavvot," huh?

333
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,541
[NONA]
Oh, that?

334
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,500
Looks like a picture book
from the living world.

335
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,041
[NONA] I liked it, so I
sent for it, that's all.

336
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,708
[OCULUS]
Hmm?

337
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,500
[OCULUS] Come by every once
in a while, I'm beggin' ya.

338
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,916
It's not fair of you
to deny me a rematch.

339
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Okay, fine. I will.

340
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,083
[NONA]
Maybe I botched this.

341
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,250
[NONA]
I'm sorry for asking so much.

342
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,125
Eh, It's okay. I like you.

343
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,291
You're always
bringing me goodies.

344
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,583
There, that one will do.

345
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,166
[CASTRA]
No. Do you see that?

346
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,458
They're both marked, actually.
Gimme a sec. I'll retag them.

347
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,458
[NONA]
I said that they'll do.

348
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,666
[CASTRA] You want them
to go to your boy, right?

349
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,958
Sorry, I can't. They have to
be sent to a special arbiter.

350
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,791
I'll bring you even
better goodies next time,

351
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,375
I promise!

352
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,541
All right. You better.

353
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,458
[CASTRA]
So, Nona, feeling the pressure?

354
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,083
Well, there was never
all that much time

355
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,625
to begin with.

356
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,833

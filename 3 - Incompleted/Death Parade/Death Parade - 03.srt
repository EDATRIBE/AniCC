00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:21,208
[giggles] Let's play again
sometime, all right?

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,083
Yeah! Sometime soon, okay?

3
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,833
[GIRL]
See ya later!

4
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,333
[DECIM]
I'm sorry, sir. Excuse me.

5
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,291
[SHIGERU grunts]

6
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,583
[SHIGERU]
What the--?

7
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,875
[DECIM]
I hope your sleep was restful.

8
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,958
What is this place?

9
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,291
I will be happy to explain
that in just a moment.

10
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,500
If you'll step this way, please.

11
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,750
[WOMAN B]
How are you?

12
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,416
Oh. I'm fine, th-thanks...

13
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,541
What is it? Is something wrong?

14
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,041
Uh-- I'm sorry.
I'm kind of out of it.

15
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,291
[DECIM]
All right.

16
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,458
We shall begin now.
Allow us to welcome you.

17
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,916
It's a pleasure to have you
here at the Quindecim.

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,625
My name is Decim, and
I'll be your bartender.

19
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,666
Now then. I have a question.

20
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,416
I hope you do not find
it too impertinent.

21
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,458
Do you remember anything just
prior to your arrival here?

22
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,833
Well, no.

23
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,791
I had been asleep when I
realized what was happening.

24
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,416
The last thing I can remember...

25
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,125
...is riding alone at
the back of the bus

26
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,083
on the way home from college.

27
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,791
Thank you for indulging me.

28
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,250
How about you?

29
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,625
No. I don't remember
anything, either.

30
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,291
Very good, thank you. Moving on.

31
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,333
I will now explain some details
about your current situation.

32
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,458
This is important.
Please pay close attention.

33
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,500
Number one!

34
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,041
First: I cannot provide
you with any information

35
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,291
regarding your present location.

36
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,875
Number two!

37
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,041
However, now that you are here,
we shall ask you to play a game.

38
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,958
What? A-A game?

39
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,791
[WOMAN]
Number three!

40
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,041
As to game selection--

41
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,625
That will be decided
upon by roulette.

42
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,250
[SHIGERU, WOMAN B gasp]

43
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,583
Number four...

44
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,208
You'll find the stakes
of the game are very high.

45
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,625
Your lives, in fact.

46
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,625
[SHIGERU]
Whoa, hold on!

47
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,791
And number five.

48
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,875
Don't worry, this is
the final point.

49
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,916
Until the game is completed,
you cannot leave.

50
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,250
[SHIGERU]
I don't think it's coming.

51
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,625
[WOMAN B]
No, neither do I.

52
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,291
[SHIGERU] What's with
this game stuff, huh?

53
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,333
Doesn't make a lot
of sense to me.

54
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,625
Huh?

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,291
Yeah.

56
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,875
Hey, is something the matter?

57
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,041
[WOMAN B]
Well, it's just that...

58
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,875
I can't remember anything.

59
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, I understand.
Neither can I.

60
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,291
No, what I mean is, I don't
remember anything at all.

61
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,250
Really, nothing. I don't
even know who I am.

62
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,208
It's like I've forgotten
everything about myself,

63
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,083
including my name.

64
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,291
It's so weird.

65
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,041
You remember some
things though, right?

66
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:28,958
Like your name?

67
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,125
A few things, yeah.

68
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,125
I know my name is Shigeru Miura.

69
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,791
[WOMAN B]
Oh, okay.

70
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,333
I'm scared. I don't
know what to do.

71
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,833
If it helps at all,

72
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,125
I believe you will recall
your name following the game.

73
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,333
Who are you, anyway?

74
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,166
How can you just promise
something like that?

75
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,833
Sorry. I'm afraid I cannot
answer that question.

76
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,625
[WOMAN B] I have to say,
having no idea who I am

77
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,708
is really pretty terrifying.

78
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,375
If it actually will
help me remember,

79
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,666
then I'd like to play the game.

80
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,708
Except that... I'm guessing
I can't play it alone.

81
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,166
All right, I'll do it.
I'll play your game.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,416
Great! Thank you so much!

83
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,791
Now, if I could just have you

84
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,458
press this button, please.
The roulette will begin.

[WOMAN] The rules are the
same as for regular bowling,

89
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,208
with some exceptions.

90
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,208
For example, you will
only be allowed to bowl

91
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,750
one ball per frame.

92
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,666
You will take turns in this
manner until the game is over.

93
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,208
Of course, as you might expect,

94
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,791
whoever knocks over
the most pins will win.

95
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,333
The balls you will use
have already been selected.

96
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,958
You'll find them on your left.

97
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,500
As you can see, they
have representations

98
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,625
of each of your hearts inside.

99
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,750
Ugh.

100
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,416
What are you saying?

You're bowling with her heart.

102

And the blue is your ball.

103
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,875
Think of that as his
heart inside of it.

104
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,416

The game will now begin.

The ball just throbbed!

110
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,166
Huh?

111
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,458
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

112
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,500
We did forget to
mention one thing.

113
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,958
You're linked to your
respective balls.

114
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,666
They register your pulses.

115
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,916
Also their temperature is the
same as that of your bodies.

116

117
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,250
[DECIM] You should know
that you will not

00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,916
feel any actual pain.
I hope that helps.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,208
There's no wiggle room, here?
We absolutely have to use these?

That is the rule, yes.

So, this is her heartbeat, huh?

123
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,250
I wonder if she's nervous.

124
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,833
It feels like it's
going a little fast.

125
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,666
[SHIGERU] And this is
the heat of her body.

She feels so warm inside.

Oh, sorry! I'm fine!

than I expected.

a little nervous.

Of course, how could he not be?

your form is great.

Is everything okay?
It's your turn.

Oh, right, sorry.

That girl I used to play with

151
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,208
back when I was a little kid.
What was her name again?

152
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,416
We were still pretty young
when she moved away.

153
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,916
Nah, it couldn't be.

154
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:34,250
Aw! That was a horrible throw!

155
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,333
[giggles] You'll do
better next time.

156
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,375
Thanks! I hope you're right.

157
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,291
A relaxed and friendly game.

once in a while.

Oh, nothing.

162
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,250
Just that you're getting
quite used to this.

163
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,333
And I appreciate your help in
explaining the rules, as well.

164
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,375
Sure thing. Don't mention it.

165

I've had such a good time.

Yeah, who knew
something like bowling

167
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,875
could be so much fun, right?

00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,583
Especially when you don't
remember how you got here,

or who you are.

Um, maybe this is weird,

00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,833

It's embarrassing in
a good way, somehow.

But why does all of
this feel so familiar?

That girl over there.

350
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,791
Her name is Mai Takada.

351
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,916
You were friends
as kids, weren't you?

352
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,208
She left school and
had plastic surgery.

353
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,625
[gasps]

354
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,458
It really stinks that
Chisato had to move.

355
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:35,291
Yeah. Sure does. But I'm
not going anywhere!

356
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,083
Let's stay together forever!

357
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,333
I love you, Shigeru!
I always will!

358
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,875
[WOMAN]
Reunited with a childhood friend

359
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,666
after dying, huh?

360
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,708
Hey, does the current Mai
even look like Chisato?

361
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,583
[DECIM]
Sorry. That I don't know.

362
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,291
[WOMAN]
Hmm.

363
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,791
It's very true, what they say.

364
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,250
Life is a great mystery.

365
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,500
Huh?

366
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,208
People all lead separate lives.

367
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,916
Spinning their own individual
tales as they go along.

368
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,125
Yet they become intertwined
somehow, tangled up,

369
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,083
and nobody knows how
they are going to end.

370
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,041
True enough, You never
know until you die,

371
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,875
and for that matter, you may not
even know after you die.

372
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,541
But, then again,

373
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,833
that's what makes
it interesting, right?

374
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,208
That was very impressive.

375
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,958
[chuckles]

376
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,416
[QUIN]

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,666
[QUIN] Hello, there.
Information bureau.

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,416
I have a favor to ask.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,958
[QUIN]
Oh?

4
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,166
[DECIM] Do you think I
could have you send me

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,916
some memories, please?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,541
Yes. Thank you very much.

00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,541
[gasps]

10
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,541
And where are you going?

11
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,375
What's it matter
to you, old man?

12
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,500
[OCULUS] I hope you enjoyed
yourself. Looked like fun.

13
00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,791
Sorry?

14
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,166
You've been bad, Nona.

15
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,750
[grunts]

16
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,541
[NONA]
No way are you sneaking a peek.

17
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,458
What you've been up
to isn't gonna fly.

18
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,291
Arbiters have to be dummies,
that's how it works.

19
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,291
Do they? Or is that
just to suit you?

20
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:22,666
Why don't you tell me
what you're after here.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,875
[NONA]
You want to know?

22
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,041
[OCULUS]
Mm.

23
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,708
[NONA] Well, the fact
is, we can change.

24
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,791
[OCULUS] I take it you're
talking about arbiters

25
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,875
who possess human emotions?

26
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,083
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, don't you see?

27
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,458
We aren't just hollow dummies!

28
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:36,583
Ah.

29
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,250
[laughs]

30
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:43,000
[OCULUS] That's so ridiculous,
it's making my flower shrivel.

31
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:46,666
We're all just dummies, Nona,
and that includes me.

32
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,083
[NONA gasps]

33
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,291
[OCULUS]
Do you understand it yet?

34
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,791
Have you figured out
what we are?

35
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,500
What we're made of?

36
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,541
The souls of those
cast into the void.

37
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,708
Don't even get me
started on our location.

38
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,041
We are what we are.

39
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,500
As long as our fundamental
essence stays the same,

40
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,583
this nonsense you're trying
to pull won't change anything.

41
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,166
Face it, my dear.

42
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,500
The arbiters will behave
as they always have.

43
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,916
[NONA]
That isn't true!

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,208
[OCULUS]
Go ahead.

45
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,208
Ah.

46
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,416
You'll see the truth
of things soon enough.

47
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,708
[elevator dings]

48
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,375
Thank you for waiting. Huh?

49
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,166
Please take us to the
lowest level, Clavis.

50
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,000
Uh. Really? Are you sure?

51
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,500
I am sure, thank you.

52
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,375
[CLAVIS]
And you're taking her with you?

53
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,083
[DECIM]
That is correct.

54
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,916
Okay.

55
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,166
[CHIYUKI'S MOM]
Chiyuki? Chiyuki.

[CHIYUKI grunts]

57
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:13,041
[gasps] What? This looks
like my room. But how?

58
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,458
Impossible. There's no way I--

[door scrapes]

63
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,250
You woke sooner than
I was expecting.

64
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,833
[DECIM] May I ask what
it is you're doing?

65
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,750
No.

66
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,916
[DECIM]
Oh, look. I remember these.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,958
They're the dolls your
mother made, right?

68
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,083
[CHIYUKI]
Mm-hmm.

69
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,708
[DECIM]
She's quite talented.

70
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,416
[CHIYUKI]
Huh? How do you figure?

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,458
They don't look
anything like the book.

72
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,791
That's okay. I
treasured them anyway.

73
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,416
This has been so strange.

74
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,125
I was starting to
think it was a dream.

75
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,166
I'm afraid this is reality.
It all happened.

76
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,833
Three months have passed
since your death.

77
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,041
Would you like me
to give you a hand?

78
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,291
[CHIYUKI] That's okay.
I can walk on my own.

79
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,916
It's empty.

[CHIYUKI gasps]

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,541
Read me the book again!

84
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,083
[CHIYUKI'S MOM] You really
like "Chavvot," don't you?

Well, I'm home.

That's my mom.

Hello, Chiyuki. I'm home again.

able to see nor hear us.

We can't touch people
in the living world.

95
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,875
We cannot converse with them.

96
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,583
We can't make contact
of any kind.

97
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,416
[CHIYUKI] You could've
told me all that sooner.

98
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,416

I am terribly sorry.

99
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,750
Why bring me here, anyway?

00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,875
If you would please take this.

What's going on?

103
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,416
This is why I brought you here.

104
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,250
It wasn't just to give you
a glimpse of your old life.

105
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,416
[CHIYUKI]
Huh?

106
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,583
Did you know 7,000
people die every hour?

107
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,750
That's approximately
two per second.

108
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,000
While it lasts, life is
riddled with unfairness.

109
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,500
There are those who
live fulfilling lives.

110
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,125
And there are those who pass
away sooner than they should.

111
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,750

112
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,958
[DECIM]
Please listen closely.

113
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,166
I have a bargain to offer you.

114
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,291
In exchange for the
life of one person,

115
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,875
I can bring you back
to life, right now.

116
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,666
[gasps]

117
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,416
[DECIM]
Simply press this button.

118
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,583
If you do that, all of your
memories of Quindecim

119
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:20,500
will be erased, and you
will return to your life.

120
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,916
You must choose
quickly, however.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,958
Little time remains.

122
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,666
What will your decision be?

123
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,250
[CHIYUKI] My life for someone
else's? That's the deal?

124
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,750
Yes.

125
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:45,875
It's possible that it will be

126
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,333
one of my friends
or family who dies.

127
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,541
[DECIM]
Yes.

128
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,791
However, do consider
the world's population.

129
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,875
It's currently more
than 7,000,000,000,

130
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,541
which makes that
highly improbable.

131
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,916
Your mother, your
father, your friends.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,375
Everybody who knows
you will have

133
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,541
any and all memories
of your death erased.

134
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,125
[CHIYUKI'S MOM]
You know, Chiyuki.

135
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,500
Watching you skate was always

136
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,458
one of the highlights of
my life, but what made me

137
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,375
happiest was watching
you grow up.

138
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,916
Seeing you become a good woman.

139
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:29,208
[sobs] I'm not a good woman.

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,833
[CHIYUKI]
Just go, okay?

142
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,958
[CHIYUKI] The fact that
I couldn't skate anymore

143
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,708
wasn't what was hard for me.

144
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:43,166
People can't know
each other perfectly.

145
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,041
And to hope for that
kind of understanding.

146
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,166
It's wrong.

147
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,458

You know, it's funny.

150
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,291
I just can't seem
to stop making extra.

00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,916
Oh, Chiyuki. I'm so sorry.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,625

tell what you were feeling.

I've failed as a mother.

00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,375
I'm sorry!

156
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,875
What kind of mother
can't even tell

157
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,166
what her own
daughter is feeling?

158
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,166
It's not true!
Mom, it's not true!

159
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,833
I miss you so much!

161
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,875
I accept. Give me my life back.

162

I have to tell my mom
it wasn't her fault!

163
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,375
I have to say sorry.

164
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,958
People have an
instinctive desire

165
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,875
to understand each other, right?

166
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,125
Maybe that's not so bad.
Or maybe it is, I don't know.

167
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,291
But it's still what I want.

168
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,125
So, yes.

169
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,708
[CHIYUKI]
I'm getting a second chance.

170
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:26,250
Let someone else die
and I can live.

171
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,958
[CHIYUKI] I have to, right?
It's the only choice I can make.

172

173
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,791
You know, you're
actually right for once.

Yeah, I'm in love
with somebody else.

175
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,583
Like I said. I think I still
have a date to claim.

176
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,083
I've always wanted to.

177
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Why couldn't I just
give her that?

178
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,791
She was always so good to me.

179
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,458
I'll do anything you want.

180
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,208
Please just send me
back to my children.

181
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,791
[TATSUMI]
I heard my wife's voice

182
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,625
thanking me for what I did.

183
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,500
So I decided that
my new job would be

184
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,250
exacting vengeance
for helpless victims.

00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,416
[CHIYUKI]
Please, control your anger.

186
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,208
Don't you wanna be
with your sister again?

[SHIMADA grunting]

00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,416
[SACHIKO]
It may be over now,

189
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,833
but at least I know
that I lived a full life.

190
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,250
[CHIYUKI]
I can't. I can't press it.

191
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't understand.

192
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:52,125
It isn't right. Everybody
matters to somebody.

193
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,166
[DECIM] But whoever ended
up dying in your place

194
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,083
most likely wouldn't
matter to you.

00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,333
[CHIYUKI]
I'm not an idiot. I know that!

196
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:02,250
I know it, but even if they
aren't important to me,

197
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,250
there's someone out there
they are important to.

198
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,708

[CHIYUKI] I'm so sorry
for not valuing my life.

I'm so sorry for not
thinking of you.

For doing something so selfish.

00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:55,875
For causing you
so much grief. Sorry!

209
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,416
And for not giving
you the chance

210
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,416
to say goodbye.
I'm so, so sorry!

I think so.

Chiyuki. I am truly sorry.

240
00:14:55,166 --> 00:15:00,208
But this was the only way.
I had to know. I'm sorry.

241
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,791
[DECIM] I am an arbiter,
and arbiters judge.

It's okay.

You don't have to apologize.

00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,416

You've destroyed
that poor boy, Nona.

252
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,541
I just had him
conduct a judgment

253
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,083
together with a human.

254
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,833
Things change as
arbiters come closer

255
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:08,083
to being human. Judgment
becomes more difficult to pass,

256
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,666
and it is accompanied
by suffering.

257
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,833
One thing's clear.
Humans can't judge humans.

258
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,583
If you know that,
then what was the point

259
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,083
of this doomed experiment?

260
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,791
Judging humans is
difficult, true.

261
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,625
But that doesn't make
it right to assign

262
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,333
any random judgment to them.
There needs to be a change.

263
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,291
That was the point
of what I did.

264
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,416
[OCULUS] So your goal is
to make arbiters suffer?

265
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,791
Care to explain the
reasoning behind that?

266
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,625
[NONA] A judgment ought to be
accompanied by suffering,

267
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,541
or what's its purpose?

268
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,708
[OCULUS]
Its purpose?

269
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,083
[NONA]
To suffer, yet stand firm.

270
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,958
That's what it is to live.
It's what gives life meaning.

271
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,416
The meaning of life?

272
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,625
That's what this is about?

273
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,458
It's a concept. It's
only relevant to those

274
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:54,166
who are able to die. And the
funny thing about dying--

275
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,083
You can't do it
unless you're alive.

276
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,875
Even if the arbiters
become more human,

277
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,875
it doesn't change the fact
that they're just dummies.

278
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,416
You're wrong. It is relevant.
We live in the present.

279
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,291
[CHIYUKI]
What is this place, anyway?

280
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,875
[DECIM] This is where the
dummies are disposed of

281
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,041
after their judgment is
complete and their souls

282
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,875
have been removed.
Under normal circumstances,

283
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,916
no one is permitted
to come in here.

284
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,083
So, this is where I'll end up?

285
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,166
[DECIM]
No.

286
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,833
Oh, good. Thanks for that.

287
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,375
After they die,
some humans try to live

288
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,166
all the more in the present.

289
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,166

lives are the kind of--

Yes.

292
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,125

Eh, no worries.

00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,166
You're stealing my

That is wonderful to hear.

00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,958
That's my goal now.

I am glad I succeeded with you.

Yeah.

316
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,375
Some advice, though.

317
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,500
Might do something
about your face.

318
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,583

Huh?

00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,833
You do know how to
smile, don't you?

00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,208
[DECIM]
Er, is it like this?

321
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,250
[sighs] Baby steps, I guess.

322
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,916
I am terribly sorry I failed.

[CHIYUKI] You'll get it
before long, don't worry.

00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,833
[GINTI]
I dunno.

Huh?

She doesn't come around
anymore, that's all.

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,416
Pour me a drink, bartender!

336
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,416
Why? What exactly is
going on with you today?

337
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,250
[CLAVIS] Please, like you
actually care, Ginti.

338
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,208

Tch, whatever.

339
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,458
[CASTRA]
Oh, yeah? Your boy did it?

340
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,541
[NONA]
Mm-hmm.

341
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,166
This sounds like a
real game-changer.

342
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,750
There are so many
arbiters. What do we do?

343
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,541
Should we retain the
memories of death again

344
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,750
and forward them on?

345
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,250
Nah. Let's just see
what happens for a bit.

346
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,208
We don't have to do anything.

You know that, right?

349
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,750
Yeah? What is she thinking?

350
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,041
[QUIN] We just need
to behave ourselves.

351
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,166
Number One:

352
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,250
Arbiters cannot stop
making judgments,

353
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,458
for this task is
more than their job.

354
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,000
It is the entire reason
for their existence.

355
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,000
Number Two:

356
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,916
Arbiters cannot
experience death,

357
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,916
for that would taint
their judgments.

358
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,041
It would make them too
close to being human.

359
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,083
Number Three:

360
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,291
Arbiters cannot feel emotions,

361
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,416
for doing so is not
in their natures.

362
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,208
It is impossible for a
dummy to have feelings.

363
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,916
[OCULUS] Number Four:
Arbiters may not work

364
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,916
hand-in-hand with life,
for doing so would ruin them.

365
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,166
It is an unacceptable
collaboration.

Weird. What is this place?

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Right this way, please.

Welcome to Quindecim.
Have a seat.

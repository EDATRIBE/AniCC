1
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:17,583
[OCULUS] Hang tight. This
should only take a second.

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,791
Isn't that just fascinating.

3
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,833
An arbiter with human emotions.

4
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,500
[DECIM] You know. I don't
believe people live

5
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,333
just so that they
can die someday.

6
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,833
I think it's because
they are alive

7
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,166
that they must die
at some point.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,500
[CHIYUKI]
Hmm.

9
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,541
I believe that there is
a purpose to being alive.

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,916
[gasps]

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,041
And there's a purpose
to judgment, as well.

12
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,625
Judging is tricky.
Difficult to do right.

13
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:52,625
It goes hand-in-hand
with both life and death.

14
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,208
By its very nature, it must
be performed hand-in-hand

15
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,125
with human beings.

16
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:01,416
And because of that,
it requires human emotions.

17
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,250
[QUIN]
There you go. It's done.

18
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,041
[QUIN sighs]

19
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,708
It's lovely, isn't it?

20
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:13,291
Yeah, sure. At first
glance, anyway. But...

21
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,458
But this isn't all.

22
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,791
There are no lives
without darkness. None.

23
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,916
[QUIN]
You got that one right.

24
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,583
What? No way! Harada?
How are you here?

25
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,500
Didn't you go to
that void place?

26
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,500
Harada! Hello? Harada, wake up!

27
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,416
Huh. What's with him?

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,416
[GINTI] That's just a shell.
His soul hasn't come back yet.

29
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Whoa, his soul's missing? Um.

30
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,666
So, how do you get it
to come back, then?

31
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,041
Not easily.

32
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,416
You need a soul to cast
into the void in its place.

33
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,250
Seriously? And if his
soul doesn't come back?

34
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,041
What then?

35
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,750
--[clatter]
--[gasps]

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,125
You get stuck with this.

37
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,125
Oh, wow.

38
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,041
I have to choose a soul
to send into the void.

39
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,916
Mine should be
good enough, right?

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,083
[GINTI]
Hm?

41
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,291
I don't see why I
can't take his place!

42
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,916
[grunts] You little idiot.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,916
Do you have any clue
what the void is like?

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,041
No, how would I?

45
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,166
[growls]

46
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,916
[GINTI]
Unfathomably reckless moron!

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,458
It's in the name:
a space containing nothing.

48
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,583
It's a graveyard for souls.

49
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,958
Your mind is all that remains.

50
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,041
Terror. Regret. Despair.

51
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,625
The sensation of falling
forever while feeling

52
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,250
only the worst emotions.

53
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,750
That's the kind of
place the void is.

54
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,166
There's no way!
You're making that up!

55
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,583
No, I'm not.

56
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,958
But I've got someone else
who can take his place.

57
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,416
Harada or this guy.
The choice is up to you.

58
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Who gets the void?

59
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,000
[MAYU]
What?

60
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,041
[DECIM] Chiyuki, please.
If you don't mind.

61
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,666
I need you to fill in
the blanks for me.

62
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,875
I don't understand
what you want me to say.

63
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,583
Start with this.

64
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,916
[MAYU] I don't get it.
Why do I have to choose?

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,791
[GINTI] Human behavior
is so predictable.

66
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,916
You're all a bunch of idiots.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,125
Huh?

68
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,458
[GINTI] You all seem to
forget that someday

69
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,708
you're gonna die.

70
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,333
Until suddenly, you come
face-to-face with death.

71
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:57,375
Then you start clinging to life.
That's why, up to now,

72
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,208
I've never had so much
as a second thought

73
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,958
about my judgments.

74
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,375
[gasps]

75
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,708
[GINTI]
Hm.

76
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,750
When you've made a decision,
press this button.

77
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,041
So, who is this guy, anyway?

78
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,041
[GINTI] Is that something
you need to know?

79
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,291
What?

80
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,125
To cast Harada into the void,

81
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,041
what kind of person
would it take?

82
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:44,250
[gasps] I don't know,
but I would never do it.

83
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,458
Then it sounds like
you've got your answer.

84
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,458
[MAYU sighs]

85
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,958

[door clicks]

87
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,500
[DECIM]
You look very lovely in that.

88

[footsteps]

89
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,750
If you'll come this way, please.

90
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,500
Welcome to Quindecim.
Have a seat.

91
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,541
My name is Decim.
A pleasure to meet you.

92
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,125
I will be your bartender
while you're here.

93
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,125
I'm sorry. Is
something the matter?

94
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,750
I'm confused. What am
I doing here?

95
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,708
I'm supposed to be dead.

96
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:10,125
[DECIM grunts]

97
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:14,291
[DECIM] You can remember
that you're dead, then?

98
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,625
Yes, but...

99
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,375
What I don't remember
is how it happened.

100
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,625
[DECIM gasps]

101
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,541
[CHIYUKI]
Please. Tell me.

102
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,833
[NONA]
Oh, really? That's unusual.

103
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,500
[DECIM] Obviously, I was
unable to prompt her

104
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,833
to play a game.

105
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,000
It sounds like the
information bureau screwed up.

106
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,791
Don't worry, all right?
I'll deal with her.

107
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,666
Deal with her? How do you mean?

108
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,958
We'll erase her memories

109
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,458
and start her judgment over.
Not too difficult.

110
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,166
Let's go ahead and
bring her with us.

111
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,166
Certainly, ma'am. I'm on it.

112
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,958
If it's not an imposition,

113
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,416
I'd actually like to
handle her judgment.

114
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
Why's that?

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,916
I'm not really sure.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,416
Huh?

117
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,458
[NONA]
Hm.

118
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,416
Well, if you want to, go ahead,

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,333
but I think I'll
leave her here awhile.

120
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,458
[DECIM]
Hm?

121
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,333
[NONA]
As an assistant of sorts.

122
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,041
Here we go.

00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,791
[DECIM] You loved to skate
more than anything, didn't you?

130
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,250
[CHIYUKI]
Mm-hmm.

131
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,625
I sustained a
serious leg injury.

132
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,000
[CHIYUKI]
They ran some tests.

133
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,541
Before long, they told me that
I would never skate again.

134
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,500
Everyone cried for me.

135
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:44,541
They were all so sympathetic.
But me? I didn't feel anything.

136
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,583
No matter what anyone said,
nothing got through to me.

137
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,875
But, I couldn't
tell anybody that.

139
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,708
It's time to eat.

Come on, dear.
Aren't you hungry?

00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,833
[CHIYUKI'S MOM]
Hm. This is the trophy you won

144
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,791
in the first
competition you entered.

145
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,916
You know, Chiyuki.

146
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,041
Watching you skate was
always one of the highlights

147
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,666
of my life, but what
made me happiest

148
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,208
was watching you grow up.
Seeing you become a good woman.

149
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,333
I'm not, though.

150
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,875
What?

151
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:52,083
[sobs] I'm not a good woman.

152
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,708

153
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,875
[CHIYUKI]
Just go, okay?

154
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,500
Okay.

[CHIYUKI sobbing]

158
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,666
[CHIYUKI] The fact that
I couldn't skate anymore

159
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,833
wasn't what was hard for me.

160
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,291
There were lots of
other things in my life

161
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:18,333
that were more important.
Like my family and friends.

162
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,875
I had lots of
friends from skating.

163
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,625
I didn't really
know what was wrong.

164
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:26,958
I was just so
confused at the time.

165
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,875
But now, I think I know.

166
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,166
These people I'd
been so close to.

167
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,041
They were, in a very
real sense, strangers.

168
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,958
I mean, they weren't me.

169
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,500
It sounds so obvious, right?

170
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,458
But somehow I'd never
realized it before.

171
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,625
And suddenly, everything
started to seem hollow.

172
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,125
I just felt like...
"I'm nothing. I'm nobody."

173
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,125
I couldn't get those
thoughts out of my head.

174
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:54,791
They festered, and I started
hating myself. Till finally...

175
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,333
[CHIYUKI]
I took my own life.

176
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,000
[CHIYUKI] People can't know
each other perfectly.

177
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,958
And to hope for that
kind of understanding...

178
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:13,666
It's wrong. I didn't realize
that until I was dead.

179
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,250
Until too late.

180
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,708
Life is so cruel.

181
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,333
[DECIM gasps]

182
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,791
[DECIM] From my understanding,
when humans are happy,

183
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,791
they smile. And when they
are sad, they shed tears.

184
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,250
Chiyuki, may I ask you

185
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,958
what emotion you are
feeling right now?

186
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,583
Well, obviously I'm
feeling sad, right?

187
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,000
And if I told you I
wanted to understand that,

188
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,833
you would say
that's wrong of me?

189
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,333
Huh?

190
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,125
Because it's true.

191
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,625
Regardless of
whether it's possible,

192
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,000
I wish I could know you better.

193
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,666
[DECIM] I've never been
part of the living world.

194
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,125
Nor have I experienced death.

195
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,916
I'm afraid I don't know the
correct way to express this,

196
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,416
but I am glad I got to meet you.
It's truly been my pleasure.

197
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,958
[gasps]

198
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,833
Uh--

199
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,000
Listen, Decim.

200
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,958
Certainly. I'm listening.

201
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,916
[sighs] Nothing, never mind.

202
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,166
[CHIYUKI]
My last drink at Quindecim.

203
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,000
So, what's this one called?

204
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,625
[DECIM] A "memento mori."
Apparently it means

205
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,666
"Remember that you must die."

206
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,416
[CHIYUKI]
"Remember that you must die."

207
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,666
"Do not forget that you
are certain to die someday,

208
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,708
and, as such, you have all
the more reason to live now."

209
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,916
I believe that is how the
phrase should be interpreted.

210
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,875
"Live now"? A little late.

211
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:05,875
Shall we?

212
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,416
Cheers, Decim.

213
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,625
Wow that's delicious!

214
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,416
[DECIM]
I am terribly sorry for this.

215
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,166
[CHIYUKI gasps]

216
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,708
[CHIYUKI]
Oh.

217
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,166
So where are we going now?

218
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,708
[GINTI] You're headed for the
place where Harada's soul is.

219
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,000
And he's really going to
wake up? You promise me?

220
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,666
[GINTI]
Yeah.

221
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,000
Something I've been wondering.

222
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,041
Who exactly is Harada
to you, anyway?

223
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,166
Don't you get it? He's my life.

224
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,708
[GINTI]
Oh, really?

225
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,500
So what would your life be,
then, if Harada wasn't around?

226
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,000
What's that mean?
Are you making fun of me?

227
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,416
I want an answer.
What's your life's meaning?

228
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,458
[MAYU]
I've got no clue, okay?

229
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,750
Why does there have
to be any meaning?

230
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,791
Oh, perfect. Someone
else who has no idea.

231
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,708
[MAYU]
Well, what about you, huh?

232
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,666
What?

233
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,750
Why do you do this?

234
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,750
Do you have some
meaningful reason?

235
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,041
No, I don't need a
reason. I'm an arbiter.

236
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,916
This is what I do.

237
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,333
Then you arbiters have
my pity. All of you.

238
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,875
[GINTI]
Pity?

239
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,750
I decided for myself
how I was going to live.

240
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,875
Maybe it wasn't a life others
would be super proud of,

241
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,875
but I devoted it to him
because I wanted to.

242
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,958
If you ask me, there is
some meaning in that.

243
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,625
[GINTI]
Wouldn't that be nice?

244
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,125
[GINTI]
And that's that.

245
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,208
[gasps] Wait! What's happening?

246
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,791
No! He lied! Harada!
I'm so sorry!

247
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,583
[MAYU]
Harada.

248
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,083
[phone ringing]

249
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,708
Hello, there.
Information bureau.

250
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,041
[DECIM]
I have a favor to ask.

251
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,375
Oh?

252
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:18,791
[DECIM] Do you think I
could have you send me

253
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,166
[QUIN]
It's happening.

254
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,333
I'm just about to
forward them along.

255
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:25,208
[NONA] All right, good.
Thank you, Quin.

256
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,166
[elevator dings]

257
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,958
[gasps]

258
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,208
And where are you going?

259
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,000
What's it matter
to you, old man?

260
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,250
[OCULUS] I hope you enjoyed
yourself. Looked like fun.

261
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,458
Sorry?

262
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,000
[OCULUS]
You've been bad, Nona.

263
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:17,250

"Suicide Tour."

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,791
Huh? Okay, where am I?

2
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,333
Ooh! Maybe it's a
haunted house? Cool!

3
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:34,250
[MAYU laughs] Where are you,
ghosts? Come out and play!

4
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,250
Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts!

5
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,666
You're here to stay,
so come out and play!

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,333
Huh?

7
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,250
[GINTI]
Hey.

8
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,208
[gasps] You talking to me?

9
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,208
You see anybody
else around here?

10
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,541
Just sit over there.

11
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,041
Since you asked nicely.

12
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,208
[footsteps, rustling]

13
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,791
Are you a collector?

14
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:22,416
Don't touch those!

15
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,750
[grunts]

16
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,958
Took your sweet
time gettin' here.

17
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,208
I'm gonna make the
spiel quick, so listen up.

18
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,333
You ready?

19
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,625
[MAYU]
What spiel?

20
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,208
In a bit, I'm gonna
have you play a game

21
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,833
against that dude over there.

22
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,625
[MAYU]
What do you mean "play a game"?

23
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:40,500
What's going on? I don't get
the point of this. Do you?

24
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,708
[MAYU gasps]

25
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,708
[MAYU]
No way.

26
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,125
Hey, um.

27
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,541
I could be totally wrong
about this, but you look like

28
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,416
Harada from Cross Heart Attack.

29
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,333
Guilty.

30
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,958
[MAYU]
No! Freaking! Way!

31
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,833
[MAYU giggles]
I am your biggest fan!

32
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,541
I don't know what I'm doing
here, but I don't care!

33
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,166
Oh, nice to meet you, too.

34
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,375
I would be so honored
if you'd shake my hand!

35
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,916
I'm Mayu Arita.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,916
Sure. No problem.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,041
[MAYU squeals]

38
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,333
[HARADA]
What is that?

39
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,041
And you're the one who
brought us together!

40
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,791
Thank you! Uh, so,
who are you, anyway?

41
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,041
Name's Ginti.

42
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,375
[MAYU] Huh? That's
kind of a weird name.

43
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,416
Are you C.H.A.'s
manager or something?

44
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,125
[GINTI]
This is gonna be a long shift.

45
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,083
[GINTI]
Listen, just press this.

46
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,208
That'll pick what game you play.

47
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,875
Playing a game with Harada?

48
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,791
I'm so totally in! Oh, do you
mind if I press the button?

49
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,291
Well, apparently we
can't leave here

50
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,500
till we play this
game. So, go ahead.

51
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,875
Here we go!

52
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:48,916
[MAYU gasps]
Ooh...

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,916
[game music plays]

54
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,250
Um, so, what's that?

55
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,833
Never heard of it.

56
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,041
All right, follow me.

57
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,000
Aw, what a cute little kitty!

58
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,083
[HARADA]
You comin'?

59
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,458
Oh! Yeah!

60
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,791
[MAYU] I wonder what this
place is. Do you know?

61
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,250
[HARADA]
No clue.

62
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,375
[MAYU]
So, no shows today, huh?

63
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,666
[HARADA] Nope. I guess
it must be my day off.

64
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,000
Only, I can't seem to
remember how I got here.

65
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:25,916
What about you?

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,125
No, I got nothin'!

67
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,208
Looks like you're
taking it pretty well.

68
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,625
[MAYU]
I'm here, chatting with Harada.

69
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,500
Nothing's gonna
ruin that for me.

70
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,166
[HARADA]
Right...

71
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,000
Ooh! That's huge!

72
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,958
[GINTI grunts]

73
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,916
[MAYU] I've got no idea
how to play this.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,666
Well, gimme a sec. I'll explain.

75
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,375
Take your socks off
and stand on the edge.

76
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,083
All right.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,375
The spinner is gonna
give you your instructions.

78
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,875
[MAYU]
What spinner?

79
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,916
This thing up here. It spins.

80
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,250
[MAYU] The kitty's the
one who controls it?

81
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,333
[GINTI]
Memine! Call her by her name.

82
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,208
[MAYU]
Okay.

83
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,291
Now, back to the instructions.

84
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,333
Just do what the
spinner tells you to.

85
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:26,041
Place the selected body part
on the selected circle.

86
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,125
If you fall or if you
touch the mat beyond

87
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,750
what's specified,
then, you lose.

88
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,333
That's it, those are the rules.

89
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,750
Everybody got it?

90
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, that sounds
simple enough to me.

[GINTI]
Ladies first, I guess.

94
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,833
You mean we're
starting already?

95
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,041
That's the idea.

96
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,875
[MAYU] You're really
grouchy, you know that?

97
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,416
And my name's Mayu, by the way.

98
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,791
You could try using it.

99

your name is, honey.

watching. Calm down, Mayu!

[MAYU humming]

116
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,833
[MAYU] I guess you can't
expect a guy not to look.

117
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,208
And considering who it is, it's
not like I'm gonna complain!

118
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,333
Is there something wrong, Mayu?
It's your turn to move.

119

[MAYU] Gah! He said it!
He said my name!

[game dings]

123
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,500
[HARADA sighs] I guess
I have to play this game,

124
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,166
but I wish the girl
was a little cuter.

She's just too obvious.

of here so I can see Lisa.

How's that gonna work?

go on forever and ever!

Yeah? What do you want?

00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,250
I need to take a little break.

Why's that?

You get one, so why can't we?

157

I'm tired, okay? And I
need to use the restroom.

It isn't just me. Harada
wants a break, too.

161
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,750
I could use one.

162
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,958
It's not gonna happen,
so quit bothering me.

163
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,916
And there's one more
thing I forgot to say.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,125
There'll be consequences
for the loser.

Potentially fatal consequences.

166
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,083

a joke or something?

kidding around?

00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,291
[MAYU] That's it! What the
hell is going on here?

177
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,750
This is the beginning
of the actual game.

178
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,458
Hope you two kids
have a lovely time.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,791
Well, what are
you waiting for?

180
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,625
It says left hand, red.
Let's get to it.

181
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,208
Fine!

182
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,708
What?

183
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,208
What happened?

184
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,500
[BOTH gasp]

185
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,541
Hot!

186
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,125
This is a prank, right?

187
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,291
It burns! Ow!

188
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,000
You can stop it now!

189
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,625
[MAYU]
Come on! Turn it off!

190
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,208
[GINTI] This is the most
fun I've had all day.

191
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,708
Why would I stop it?

192
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,291
I can't wait to see who's
gonna lose their balance first.

193
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,916
--[MAYU groaning]
--Hot! Hot!

194
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,916
[MAYU]
Quick! It's left hand green!

[HARADA gasps]

196
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,541
[yelps]

197
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,500
That feels nice!

198
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,500
Huh?

199
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,458
[screams]

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,208
You can just turn around!

201
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,875
[GINTI] You really think
anybody's interested

202
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,875
in whatever you've
got under there?

203
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,208
[growls] What did you say to me?

204
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:26,458
[screaming]

205
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:30,458
[MAYU] This wind's too strong.
I can't take a breath.

206
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,166
Quick! It's your move!

207
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,708
[MAYU]
Oh, right. Blue.

208
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,333
Well, player two, move your
right foot to yellow.

209
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:49,416
[BOTH panting]

210
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,833
You should really
focus on the game,

211
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,333
unless you wanna die.

212
00:11:52,416 --> 00:12:00,083
[panting]

213
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,250
Freezing!

214
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,041
Right foot yellow.
That's not good.

215
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,958
[HARADA]
It'll be close.

216
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,083
D-D-Do you think
you can do it?

217
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,000
[gasps]

218
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,458
[HARADA] It's frozen?
No way! That isn't fair!

219
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,875
That's the kinda
thing that happens

220
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,291
when you dilly-dally.

221
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,166
[HARADA grunting]

222
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,625
Damn it!

[panting]

224
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,833
[MAYU] This is it.
We're gonna die here.

225
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,416
Although, this could
be a "Titanic" moment!

226
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,916
Wouldn't that be romantic?

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
These poses are
kinda awkward, though.

228
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,500

[HARADA grunting]

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,333
Can he do it?

232
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:06,250
You should never doubt
the dance prince!

233
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,958
[HARADA yells]

Harada!

[laughs]

239
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,541
I can't believe we did it!
You were amazing!

240
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,083
I thought we were gonna die!

241
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:55,083
[panting] It was nothin'!

242
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,083

--[HARADA] Not again!

Oh, god! No way!

[HARADA, MAYU scream]

246
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,166
Stunning view, isn't it?

247
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,666
You psycho! Get us out of here!

248
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,416
[GINTI]
No, I don't think I will.

249
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,708
This may come as a surprise,

250
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,833
but I don't actually care
what happens to you.

251
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:24,916
This is my favorite part
of the whole thing.

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,375
Welcome to the
sudden death round.

253
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,458
The game's about to end. Just as
soon as one of you falls.

254
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,375
[GINTI] There. Took a while,
but we've finally

255
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,875
reached the entertaining
part. Pathetic humans.

256
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,375
[HARADA]
When one of us... falls?

257
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,916
[MAYU]
Oh, god.

258
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,500
[HARADA]
Falls or... gets pushed.

259
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,125
[MAYU]
What do I do?

260
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,250
[panting]

261
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,333
[MAYU]
I can't.

262
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:05,125
[HARADA whimpering]

263
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,458
[HARADA]
It's either her or me.

264
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,208
[MAYU] It's... hopeless.
I can't hold it anymore!

265
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,666
[MAYU] I can't pee myself
in front of Harada.

266
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,458
I'd rather...

267
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,625
[MAYU]
It's over. I quit.

268
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,166
It's been amazing.

269
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,791
I got to play a game,
one-on-one, with Harada.

270
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,333
What more could a girl ask for?

271
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:42,375
I'm so happy. This is
a dream come true.

272
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:46,833
Ever since that first concert,
I've been your biggest fan.

273
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,416
I went to your shows
and bought your posters.

274
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,458
I even sent you fan mail.
A lot of fan mail.

275
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:58,208
Whenever things got tough,
or I was having a bad day,

276
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,166
I would listen to your songs,
and they would cheer me up.

277
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, anyway. I guess what
I'm saying is, thanks.

278
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,208
Thanks, Harada, for
always being there.

279
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,875
[MAYU]
Without you and your music,

280
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,875
there were times I
couldn't have kept going.

281
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,875
[MAYU] I know people always
called you a womanizer.

282
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,958
But I never cared
about any of that.

283
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:32,125
I was your fan, no matter what!
They just didn't understand.

284
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,458
You treat fans like they're
special. That's how you are.

285
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,750
[gasps]

286
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,875
How could you?

287
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,458
Breaking up with me like I
never meant anything to you!

288
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,000
Hey, I said I'm sorry, Kana.

289
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,041
[laughs]

290
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,083
[HARADA] Kana, oh my god.
I didn't want this to happen.

291
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,208
No, my fans deserve better.

292
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,625
If I can ask one thing,
please don't forget me.

293
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,500
Good luck with C.H.A. and your
dancing and everything.

294
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,125
You'll be great!

295
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,500
Well, goodbye.

No! Not this again!

298
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,791
What are you doing?

299
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,708
[HARADA]
I can't let you do this.

300
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:35,000
We'll find some way
out. Right, Mayu?

301
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,041
Without you, I'd be nothing!

302
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,000
Huh?

303
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,125
[HARADA]
My fans make me who I am.

304
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,041
They make me a success!

305
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,958
It's because of them that
I've come so far in my life.

306
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,250
It's because of you, Mayu!

307
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,000
How could I forget
something as basic as that?

308
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,083
It won't happen again!

309
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,083

mean that! Wow.

[grunts]

311
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,041
I can't let it end like this.
I can't do it! Promise me!

312
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,708
Say you'll come to one
of my concerts again!

313
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,458
Yeah!

314
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,625
[HARADA] Do you promise?
I want you to promise!

Yes! I promise you I will!

I wanted to let you know
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

to leave already?

Is it all coming
back to you now?

Well, this is interesting.

347

You heard the part about
being dead, right?

[HARADA]
How can I be dead?

Wow, I didn't
recognize you at all!

Huh?

You look a whole lot
cuter this way.

Really? I do?

We're already dead, you know!

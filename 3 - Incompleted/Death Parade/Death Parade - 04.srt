the elevators, too.

[MISAKI]
Well, it took you long enough.

24

Don't meet many
celebrities, do you?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,041
Uh. It's just different
seeing you in person.

[MISAKI]
How so?

27
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,583
You look younger.

Are you saying that
I look old on TV?

That's not...

Fine. Whatever.

31
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,791
So they do lots of
hidden camera shows

32
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,916
during the summer, right?
That's what this is.

Really?

There's no doubt about it.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,916
I could tell my manager
was hiding something.

36

Okay, but, you're
sure about this?

37
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,666
That's why I dragged us in here
where there aren't any cameras.

as bright as you look.

I need you to act like you
don't know what's happening.

44
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,291
The director will
want our reactions

45

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,541

done any acting before.

All right, then.

We should just sit down and
play without any strategies.

Did someone bring me?

It's always been like this.

346
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,541
My entire life,
everyone has lied to me.

347
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,625
Before I knew it,
I had five kids.

348
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,041
But I didn't care what
anyone thought of me.

349
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,250
And then, everything
suddenly changed.

350
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,666
My life was only beginning.

351
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,583
After all that misery,
I finally found happiness.

352
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:41,166
I finally had the chance
to make my children happy.

353
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:51,208
[sobbing]

354
00:19:51,291 --> 00:20:00,833
[sobbing]

355
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:05,541
How could I? Why did I do it?

356
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,916
Why did I kill myself?

357
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,041
Well, someday...

358
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,458
I'd love it if Yousuke
felt close enough to me

359
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,083
to call me his mom.

360
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,583
Why couldn't I just
give her that?

361
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:24,625
She was always so good to me.
Why am I so messed up?

362
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,666
[MISAKI]
Listen, please.

363
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,666
I'll do anything you want.

364
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,875
Please just send me
back to my children.

365
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,916
[DECIM]
Huh?

366
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,125
Send me back to them!

367
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:48,583
[gasps] Let me go!
Take your arms off of me!

368
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:55,666
Let me go! Let go of me!
Please, stop.

369
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,250
No matter what, you did
the best you could.

370
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,750
[gasps]

371
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,916
[YOUSUKE, MISAKI sobbing]

372
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,125
Both of you. You did
the best you could.

373
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:25,166
[YOUSUKE, MISAKI sobbing]

374
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,166
Thank you for playing.

375
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,333
Best of luck on your journey.

376
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,208

[NONA]
No can do. I have to go.

177
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,166
There are other
managers in the tower.

178
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,916
Call one of them.
I'm a busy girl.

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,125
[OCULUS] But, Nona! You're
the one I wanna play!

180
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,791
[NONA]
Hey, Clavis. You ready?

181
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,541
[CLAVIS]
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,958
Man, at this rate when will I

183
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,291
ever be able to
turn things around?

184
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,166
[NONA] Heh. Maybe you
should go ask God.

185
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,166
If you'll excuse us.

186
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,625
[OCULUS]
I'm afraid God has been

187
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,791
gone for a long time now.

188
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,916
[MAN 5A]
Let me outta here, right now!

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,541
You wouldn't want the kid
to get hurt, would ya?

190
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,416
[BOY whimpers]

191
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,166
[DECIM]
Easy. Let's talk a moment.

192
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,166
About what?

193
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,583
Please bear with me.

194
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,166
Have you ever heard the story
"The Spider's Thread"?

195
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,166
[MAN 5A] What? Why bring
up that old tale?

196
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,125
What's going on here?

197
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,583
[DECIM]
Kandata is languishing in Hell.

198
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,375
But the Buddha dangles a
spider's thread down to him.

199
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,708
He does so because, just once,
Kandata spared a spider's life.

200
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,375
Kandata, who has long
dreamt of Paradise,

201
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,291
begins climbing up the thread.

202
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,125
However, many other sinners
soon follow after him.

203
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,416
Kandata fears that the
thread is going to break,

204
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,875
and so he seeks to shake
the others from it.

205
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,875
Who cares about your damn story?

206
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,208
Do you even get
what's going on here?

207
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,541
What would have been better
is if they'd been kept

208
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,541
from seeing the thread
in the first place.

209
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,541
Shut up, you freak!

210
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,083
[MAN 5A gasps]

211
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,916
[DECIM]
Much better.

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,125
[MAN 5A groans]

213
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,875
Are you okay?

214
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,375
Not again! Damn it, not again!

215
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:56,000
I am terribly sorry, sir.
I hate to be so rough.

216
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,083
But really, you must allow
me to speak with you.

217
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,666
Let me out of this, or... I'll--

Ah--

[DECIM gasps]

223
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,416
You're no normal little boy.

224
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,041
[BOY chuckles] You still
haven't figured it out?

225
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,416
That's pretty pathetic, Decim.

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,708
[DECIM gasps]

227
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,750
Ugh! Didn't see that coming!

228
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,000
All I did was put her to sleep.

229
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,541
[voice deepening] Is she really
that important to you?

230
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,375
Interesting.

231
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,500
It's been a long
time, hasn't it?

232
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,875
Hello again, Ginti.

233
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,458
[GINTI]
That's the guest you were unable

234
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,375
to pass judgment on, right?

235
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,083
[DECIM]
Yes.

236
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,500
What happened there?

237
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,000
[DECIM]
It was an unusual situation.

238
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,458
When she came to
Quindecim, she could

239
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,291
remember that she was dead.

240
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,541
Yeah, that is weird.
Never heard of that happening.

241
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,833
As you might imagine,

242
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,666
I was therefore unable
to prompt her to play

243
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,583
the required game.

244
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,458
Ultimately, I wound up
having her memories

245
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,791
erased and her judgment
period extended.

246
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,708
[GINTI] So, have her memories
of being human returned?

247
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,458
No, they have not yet come back.

248
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,708
[GINTI]
Really?

249
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,208
Then what the hell is
she doing here with you?

250
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,958
She is assisting me
with my judgments.

251
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,916
[gasps] A human? Are you
screwing with me?

252
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,041
A human? Are you
out of your mind?

253
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:14,958
You've gotta be.

254
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,541
It's not crazy.

255
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,750
I have respect for people who
have lived a fulfilling life.

256
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,750
Additionally, her
observations are astute

257
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,416
and her opinions, fresh.

258
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,666
Frankly, I find her fascinating.

259
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,250
[GINTI] You say that
with a straight face,

260
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,416
like it's totally normal.

261
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,958
Am I gonna have to beat
some sense into you?

262
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,416
[GINTI]
Let's go!

263
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,416
[DECIM]
We can keep going if you'd like.

264
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,625
You've changed,
and I think I like it.

265
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,041
I'm happy to keep
playin' if you are!

266
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,708
But if you think you're gonna
beat me... you're crazy!

268
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,416
Stop it!

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,958
Don't-- [groans]

270
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,750
[NONA] Too far! I didn't give
you permission for this.

Oh-ho! This place is destroyed.

00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,291
You insisted on doing
this, so I let you,

but now you're making
me regret it.

I hope you are doing
well, and you, Clavis.

You're fighting this moron?

00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,250
What's gotten into you?
You never rise to Ginti's bait.

280
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,000
Moron?

281
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:44,250
True. I am usually immune.

282
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,041
Well, we'll let it go for now.

283
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,500
So. Can you guess
what I'm doing here?

284
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,958
[DECIM]
Uh.

285
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,166
[NONA] Do you know anything
about Quin's memory test?

286
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,333
I've heard of it,
but I don't know much.

287
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,416
Is that what this
is supposed to be?

288
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,916
Yep. Honestly, totally
hopeless, aren't you?

289
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,375
[laughs]

290
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,041
[NONA]
Shut up, moron.

291
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,000
[laughs]

292
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,625
[GINTI]
Little weasel!

293
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,541
[NONA] You paid too much
attention to the decoy.

294
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,041
Yes, ma'am.

295
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,208
What's supposed to happen
prior to our guests' arrival?

296
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,875
The information
bureau edits down

297
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,958
and compiles their memories,

298
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,708
which are sent to the
arbiters for review

299
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,708
before the game begins.

300
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,916
The memory compilations
are one of the bases

301
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,666
for our judgments.

302
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,583
[NONA] And today was
different because...

303
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,416
Today was different
because the boy's memories

304
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,708
were not sent.

305
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,833
[NONA]
Continue.

306
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,375
Initially, at least,
I was on my guard.

307
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,708
But then there was that man.

308
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,583
Because of him, your
attention was diverted.

309
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,666
That's correct.

310
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,166
Pitiful!

311
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,458
There's no such thing as a
human being with no memories!

312
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,875
The shock of dying makes
things hazy for a bit,

313
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,666
but their latent memories
don't vanish into thin air.

314
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,750
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,375
Testing the arbiters
in such a manner

316
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,916
is often necessary.
Do you know why?

317
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No.

318
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,500
You draw out the
darkness in their souls

319
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,333
as much as possible.
Then you make your judgment.

320
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,875
To do that, you must
create extreme conditions,

321
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,708
and that requires intimate
knowledge of your guests' lives.

322
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,375
What is it?

323
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,375
[DECIM] Nothing. I'm
sorry for my mistake.

324
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,291
[NONA] To sum up, if the
memories aren't sent to you,

325
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,291
cancel the game. End of story.

326
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,541
Yes, ma'am.

327
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,750
You can get up now,
sleeping beauty.

328
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,458
[gasps]

329
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,125
[NONA] I'm finished here.
Get the elevator.

330
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,666
[CLAVIS]
I've already called it.

331
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,583
[DECIM]
One more thing.

332
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,625
[NONA]
Hmm? What is it now?

333
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,583
What shall I do
with this gentleman?

334
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,875
[NONA]
That's just a dummy with some

335
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,416
fuzzy memories implanted.
It's not human.

336
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,125
[DECIM]
That makes sense.

337
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,291
Well, carry on, you three.

338
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,541
[CLAVIS]
Will do!

339
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,166
Tch.

340
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, Ginti.

341
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,250
Was there something else you
wanted to talk to me about?

342
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,166
--[GINTI] Huh?
--[CLAVIS chuckles]

343
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,333
You're one stupid,
stone-cold bastard,

344
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,958
you know that?

345
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,291
[CASTRA]
Uh-oh.

346
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,875
Your boy didn't do
too well, I take it?

347
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,541
How very perceptive
of you, Castra.

348
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,000
Quin's little test with
the memories, right?

349
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,458
And how many years has
he been an arbiter now?

350
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,875
It's been five years.

351
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,458
Say what you want, I still
prefer him to that moron.

352
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,666
You're talking
about Ginti, right?

353
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,875
What can I say?

354
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,041
I'm a sucker for men
who are pretty and dumb.

355
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,916
[NONA]
So, what's the situation?

356
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,791
[CASTRA]
Oh, you know. Same as always.

357
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,375
They're dying too fast.

358
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,291
We're talking 7,000
an hour, here.

359
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,666
The righteous just can't seem
to stop killing each other.

360
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,125
You'd think that
they'd lose interest.

361
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,708
[NONA]
Yeah, right.

362
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,958
I know Information's swamped,
but they're not the only ones.

363
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,000
Maybe you could put a word
in to Oculus for me?

364
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,833
[NONA]
I'll see what I can do.

365
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,208
The trick is to find ways
to alleviate the boredom

366
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,750
for a little bit.

367
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
[NONA]
Sometimes he irritates me.

368
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,375
There's laid back and then
there's just plain lazy.

369
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,416
What do you think I wanna
talk to you about, huh?

370
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,666
Judge that woman,
and do it right now!

371
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,541
An arbiter and a human
can't work together.

372
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,958
It's not possible!

373
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,416
Let it go, Ginti.

374
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,083
Decim is supposed to handle
this situation on his own.

375
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,208
Nona says so, and you don't
wanna go against her, do you?

376
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,583
[GINTI]
Come on, man, don't you get it?

377
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,875
Just looking at this idiot
makes me wanna punch something!

378
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,208
[CLAVIS] There's no reason
for us to get involved here.

379
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,291
Decim can pass judgment
however he wants.

380
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,958
Anyway, don't you have guests
coming? Let's get going.

381
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,125
Fine, I'm coming.

382
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,875
And for me? Do I
have any guests?

383
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,541
[CLAVIS] You've got the
day off, you lucky dog.

384
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,750
See ya later.

385
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,958
Thank you very much, Clavis.

386
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,458
[MOTHER 5A] "Let's play!"
said Jimmy to the little girl.

387
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,666
"It'll be fun!" But the little
girl just smiled at him

388
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,583
and didn't say anything back.
You see, the girl couldn't hear,

389
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,833
so she didn't know
what Jimmy had said.

390
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,708
Jimmy wanted to
explain what he meant

391
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:48,041
without using words, so he
ran, and he fell down,

392
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,916
and he played in the
snow, and he laughed.

393
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,875
And pretty soon,
the girl joined in, too.

394
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,166
Jimmy was very, very happy.

395
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,583
He didn't know her
name, but even so,

396
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,416
he knew that the two of them
would be good friends.

397
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,208
Nothing could change that!

398
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,708
That evening,

399
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,125
Jimmy told his mom about how
he had played with the girl.

400
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,666
Jimmy's mom listened to
everything he had to say,

401
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,166
and then she told him that
the girl's name was Chavvot.

402
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,625
Jimmy slowly sipped his
big mug of hot cocoa,

403
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:22,166
and as he did, he said
"Chavvot, Chavvot"

404
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,333
over and over again.

405
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,166
"Someday I'll be able
to tell her how I feel.

406
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,208
Someday" he promised the bright
stars in the winter sky.

407
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,750
[WOMAN gasps]

408
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,625
[WOMAN]
Wha--? Huh? That's strange.

409
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,208
I don't remember falling asleep.

410
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,416
[yawns]

411
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:17,333

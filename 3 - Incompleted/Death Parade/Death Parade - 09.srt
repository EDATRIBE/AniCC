1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,000
There was this guy who had been

2
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,625
giving her a lot of trouble.
A stalker, you know?

3
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:24,250
I even told the police about it.
But they didn't do anything.

4
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,416
I can't let him...
just get away with it.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,250
[TATSUMI] Revenge, huh?
I know something about that.

6
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,750
It's what I'm after, too.

7
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,791
It is?

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,208
I'm sure this isn't
the kinda thing

9
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,583
that you'd expect to
hear from a detective.

10
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,083
But when I get outta here...

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,708
...somebody is going to die.

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:49,875
[WOMAN panting]
It wasn't just one of them?

13
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,041
They're both killers?

14
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,708
Your wife was murdered?
I'm so sorry!

15
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,625
Yeah. My attention was
always somewhere else,

16
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:29,750
I guess. Sorta comes with the
territory of being a detective.

17
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:34,000
That doesn't excuse it.
I should've protected her.

18
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,333
I will protect you.
I promise, whatever it takes.

19
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,750
So you're looking
for revenge, too.

20
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,375
[TATSUMI]
Yeah.

21
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,041
What're you planning
to do to the bastard

22
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,791
when you find him?

23
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,083
Well, honestly,

24
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,416
I wouldn't mind
torturing him, but...

25
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,875
I think I can settle
for killing him, instead.

26
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,208
I admire your honesty.
And I agree.

27
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,666
His death would make
the world a better place.

28
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,041
Some people need to be put down.

29
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,625
That's what they're like?
The memories of the dead?

30
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,791
Confusing? A bunch of
scenes jumbled together.

31
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,666
They can be hard
to make sense of.

32
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,208
Thus, they are insufficient.

33
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,416
You can't get a full picture
of someone just from memories.

34
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,291
So, you're a detective
who endorses murder?

35
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,500
[TATSUMI]
It's taking out society's trash.

36
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,208
Most of the cases we handle
in the investigative division

37
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,333
are so vile, they'd shock
the crap outta ya.

38
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,375
You ask me, these perps can
barely be considered human.

39
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,541
I'm not sayin' this
as a detective.

40
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,666
I'm sayin' it as
one human to another.

41
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,583
Killing this guy--it's just
the right thing to do.

42
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,833
I...

43
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,250
[gasps]

44
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,791
[WOMAN] Come on, Decim.
You should stop it.

45
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,166
This is how it's done.

46
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,208
They must expose their souls,
the darkness within.

47
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,791
And then I pass
judgment upon them.

48
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,958
That's my job. That's what
it is to be an arbiter.

49
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,291
[SHIMADA groans]

50
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,125
[doorbell rings]

51
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,333
Huh?

52
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,250
[SHIMADA, MAN 9A grunting]

53
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:48,750
[MAN 9A, SHIMADA grunting]

54
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,375
[SHIMADA yells]

55
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,708
[panting]

56
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,291
[SHIMADA gasps]

57
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,375
What's wrong, kid?

58
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,291
What the hell are you
doing with that thing?

59
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:12,166
[SHIMADA] I don't understand.
I-I already killed the man.

60
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,500
I stabbed him!
I did it with this!

61
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,208
I killed him.

62
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:24,958
I want them to die for
what they did to me.

63
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,208
Them? There was more than one?

64
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,083
There was a man.
He just watched.

65
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,250
I think they were friends.

66
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,500
One guy is dead,
but it's not over.

67
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,791
There was another bastard there.

68
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,791
The darkness of the soul.

69
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,541
Do you happen to know
what the most primitive

70
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,958
emotion human beings
experience is?

71
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,000
Fear, my dear.

72
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,458
This is crazy.

73
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,666
[TATSUMI groans]

74
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,250
Are you okay?

75
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,875
[sputters, groans]

76
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,291
[MAN 9B]
No! Please! Don't kill me!

77
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,833
[MAN 9B whimpers]

78
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,333
[MAN 9B screams]

79
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:36,166
[TATSUMI panting]
Yumi. I killed him. It's over.

80
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,375
[YUMI echoing]
Thank you.

81
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,500
[SHIMADA]
Hey, Tatsumi! Can you hear me?

82
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,125
Please get up!

83
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,500
There's something really
wrong with him! What should we--

84
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,125
[DECIM] If you would please
continue playing the game.

85
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,208
Seriously? But he's--!

86
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,958
[DECIM]
The score is currently tied.

87
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,666
Each of you has four points.

88
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,583
If you'll look at the next puck,
you'll notice that it's yours.

89
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,041
If you score a goal,
the points will be doubled.

90
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,000
You will reach the
stipulated score.

91
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,166
And, thus, you will be
declared the winner.

92
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,916
Of an air hockey game?
Who cares about that right now?

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,958
Tatsumi needs help!
Don't you get it?

94
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,458
[DECIM]
Before we began, I spoke about

95
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,625
the stakes of the game.
Your lives, remember?

96
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,833
[SHIMADA] Come on! This is
starting to get ridiculous!

97
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,125
Just find him some help!

98
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,416
I think you'll find
that won't be necessary.

99
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,791
Huh?

100
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,750
Tatsumi, you're all right!

101
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:35,041
Thank god! I don't know what
I would've done if you...

102
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,666
You're all right, aren't you?

103
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,625
Yeah, kid, I'm fine.

104
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,375
Let's just keep playing, okay?

105
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,166
[SHIMADA]
Uh-- What are you talking about?

106
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,500
The game doesn't matter
anymore! I forfeit!

107
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,416
[TATSUMI] Like you said
before, your revenge

108
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,625
isn't complete yet.

109
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, no, but if it means

110
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,541
putting you through
this, then...

111
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,000
[TATSUMI]
Don't wuss out on me now.

112
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,291
Huh?

113
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,458
[grunts]

114
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't you get it, Shimada?

115
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:05,083
You have to finish this guy,
or else he'll just do it again.

116
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,375
I know that. But I can't
keep torturing you.

117
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,416
Think about the bastard.

118
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
About squeezing the
life out of him.

119
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,875
I don't know, I...

120
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,125
[TATSUMI] Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

121
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,375
You do, don't ya, kid?

122
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,625
All right then. Let's do this.

123
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,500
[TATSUMI]
Okay, ready?

124
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,291
[SHIMADA]
Mm...

125
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,958
[TATSUMI]
I'm counting on you, here.

126
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,666
You're not gonna let
me down, are ya, kid?

127
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,041
Huh?

128
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,583
You're just like me.
You want the same thing I do.

129
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,750
I respect you for that.

130
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,750
Okay.

131
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,791
Hit the damn puck.

132
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,791
I'm not sure.

133
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,041
You're not gonna
let the people who

134
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,125
attacked your sister get
off like that, are you?

135
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,458
Why don't you get it?

136
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,958
The problem is I don't
wanna hurt you

137
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,875
in order to take my revenge!

138
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,708
Nothing comes free
in this world.

139
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,500
To get what you want,
you gotta make sacrifices.

140
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,583
Huh?

141
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,375

If you're not even willing

142
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,875
to cause me a little pain,

143
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,125
how do you think you're
gonna get your revenge?

144
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,000
You probably just lucked
out with the first one.

145
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,083
Let's get on with it.

146
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,875
I don't mind being
your sacrifice.

147
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,750
Not if it gets you the
vengeance you deserve.

148
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,750
Now come on and settle
the score for your sister!

149
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:34,041

[TATSUMI] What the hell?
Hold on. Does this mean...?

156
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,333
[DECIM]
The game is complete.

157
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:46,375
Mr. Shimada wins, six to four.
Our congratulations to you.

158
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,333
That's it.

159
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,708
[TATSUMI]
Shimada...

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,500
[TATSUMI] So... You're Sae
Shimada's older brother?

161
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,791
Huh? Hold on!
You know my sister?

162
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,375
Hey, what're you... doing?

163
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,458
[TATSUMI]
So, tell me. Is this it?

164
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,625
Is this knife the weapon
I was killed with?

165
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,875
Yes, it is.

166
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,375
What?

167
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,916
Allow me to explain.

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,458
Following their deaths,
people are sent

169
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,166
to either Heaven or to Hell.

170
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,750
You see, this is the
tribunal of the soul.

171
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,833
[TATSUMI] Tribunal of
the soul? Quite a name.

172
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,958
It is. And I'm the
designated arbiter.

173
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,541
I am terribly sorry for
the necessary deception.

174
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,916
So we're here to be judged.

Yeah, very funny.
So, is the joke over now?

You are joking, right?

177
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,666
[DECIM] Interesting.
You still cannot remember?

See, Shimada, you've
forgotten something

179
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,125
pretty important. I'm
guessing you don't remember

that that bastard's blood
got inside my body.

Anybody can turn brutal,

It's a fine line when

been for others.

If you're reincarnated,
you may be able to see

346
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,125
your sister again
in some other form.

347
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,125
That man is watching
what you do.

348
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,000
He's the one who ultimately
decides what happens.

349
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,083
Is she telling the truth?
Is this part of the judgment?

350
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,208
[WOMAN]
Please, control your anger.

351
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,875
Don't you wanna be
with your sister again?

352
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,000
[growls]

353
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,375
If you're cast into the void,

354
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,458
that won't even
be a possibility!

355
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,791
[SHIMADA grunts]

356
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,916
[SHIMADA grunting]

357
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,500
[SHIMADA whimpers]

358
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,916
[TATSUMI] Please! That's
just wishful thinking.

359
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,166
If you can't protect
somebody, then, hey,

360
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,791
all you can do is
kill the other guy.

361
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,750
The world's a cruel,
screwed up place,

362
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,250
and we have to accept it.

363
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,625
You can't change
that, nobody can.

364
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,666
The only thing you
can do is fight back!

365
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:18,333
[whimpers] You see, Sae.
I'm gonna do it right this time.

366
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,458
I'm gonna protect you.

367
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:27,291
[footsteps]

368
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,625
[WOMAN]
You don't get it!

369
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,583
People aren't as complex as
you seem to think they are.

370
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,166
They're really pretty simple.

371
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,500
They get sad and angry
over simple things.

372
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,666
Can you understand that?
People are simple creatures!

373
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,083
The littlest things
send them spinning,

374
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,416
and they live never knowing
when they're going to fall.

375
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,708
That's what being human is!

376
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,666

[DECIM]
This is odd.

4
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,000
What is it?

5
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,958
If you can wait for
just a moment, please.

6
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,083
I must verify this.

[phone ringing]

8
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,875
Nona here.

9
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,416
Ma'am, it appears we
have a guest arriving

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,458
in the bar shortly who
has killed someone.

11
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,416
[WOMAN gasps]
What?

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,791
[NONA] Oh, yeah? Well,
you'll have to handle it.

13
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,125
The others are up
to their eyeballs.

14
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:03,000
[DECIM] But, ma'am, I have
no experience with this.

15
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,041
[NONA] Don't over-think it.
Killers are still people, right?

16
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,375
I'm sure it'll be
pretty standard.

17
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,333
As you say, ma'am.

18
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,208
Yes. Yes, I understand.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,500
We're doing this?

20
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,916
[DECIM] Yes. She said the
others are all occupied.

[WOMAN]
So, which one is it?

24
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,083
[DECIM]
Which one is what?

25
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,625
One of them is a
murderer, right?

26
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,583
[DECIM]
It seems they have arrived.

27
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,791
[DECIM]
Right this way, please.

28
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,041
Have a seat, and
welcome to Quindecim.

29
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,875
My name is Decim, and I
will be your bartender.

30
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,708
Hi. Nice to meet ya.

31
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,625
Now then, you may find
this a strange question,

32
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,541
but I'm afraid that
I do have to ask it.

33
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,666
Do you remember anything

34
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,250
from just prior to
your arrival here?

35
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:49,083
Huh... Well, actually,
now that you mention it.

36
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,166
I don't remember
much of anything.

37
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,125
I'm pretty sure I was
on my way somewhere.

38
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,125
But that's really about it.

39
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,833
Thank you for indulging me.

40
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,125
And if I may ask you the same?

41
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,416
Let me think.

42
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,291
It seems I was headed
someplace, as well.

43
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,416
But I don't remember where.

44
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,958
Very good. Thank you
for answering.

45
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,791
[TATSUMI] Never mind that.
What is this place?

46
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,000
All right.

47
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,500
I will now explain a
number of things about

48
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,583
your current situation.

49
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:26,666
This is rather important, so
please do pay close attention.

50
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,791
We're supposed to risk
our lives on a game?

51
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,750
Why don't we split up
and look for an exit?

52
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,791
[SHIMADA] Sounds good. I'll
start in that direction, okay?

53
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,375
Go for it.

54
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,375
No good. It's just a bathroom.

00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,125

What's in here?

[SHIMADA gasps]

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,041

Uh, yes?

Oh, you taking
a leak? I'm sorry.

66
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,791
[SHIMADA]
Oh, no!

67
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:30,291
I mean, I'm done here.
It's no problem.

68
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,958
Well, I struck out.
How 'bout you?

69
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,666
[SHIMADA]
No luck here.

70
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,000
[TATSUMI] There really aren't
any exits, are there?

71
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,500
No.

72
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,333
As I tried to explain, you will
not be able to leave here

73
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,541
until the game is completed.

74
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,875
You sure about that?

75
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,875
Do you really wanna screw
around with a detective?

76
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,000
What?

77
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,458
[TATSUMI]
This is false imprisonment.

78
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,083
Section 2-20 of
the criminal code.

79
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,458
Keeping us here like this
is illegal, pal. You get that?

80
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,958
[TATSUMI]
Got nothin' to say, huh?

81
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,333
What if we don't play your game?

82
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,000

recommend that you do.

the game, we end up like that?

I'm terribly sorry
for being vague.

But I'm afraid I cannot
say more than I have.

[SHIMADA]
What, me? I-I'm really scared.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,125
Where are we? Are those
people murderers?

93
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,416
[TATSUMI]
No, I don't think so.

94

[TATSUMI] Just call it
an occupational hazard.

When I look a guy in the eyes,

97
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,833
I can usually judge
what kinda person he is.

98
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,958
His aren't the eyes of a killer,

99
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,041
but they don't look like
the eyes of a liar, either.

[SHIMADA] Oh, good. I mean,
that's a relief, right?

Hm?

00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,458
Glad you're here, detective.
It's reassuring, you know?

103
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,541
Ah, knock off the
"detective" business.

104
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,583
You can just call me Tatsumi.

105
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,750
[SHIMADA] Okay, Tatsumi it is,
and my name is Shimada,

106
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:08,625
by the way.

107
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,375
Okay.

108
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,666
Well, Shimada, think you
could work with me?

109
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,250
Huh?

We'll play your
screwed up little game,

this won't be the last time

114

you're gonna hear from me.

115
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,250
Yes, sir. Understood.

the same as they are

for regular air hockey.

119
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,750
You'll use the paddles to
hit the puck back and forth,

00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,541
trying to score on the
other player's goal.

121
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,416
For each goal that you score,
you will win one point.

Whoever reaches a total
of six points first

123
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,291
will be declared the
winner of the game.

124
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,625
[WOMAN] However. The pucks
are a little unusual.

125
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,541
They are inscribed
with various images,

126
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,958
corresponding to your
respective bodies.

00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,500
Ugh! What the hell was that?

The red pucks are for Shimada,

while the blue pucks
are for Tatsumi.

Attempt to score using
a puck of your own color.

If you do, you will
earn double points.

[WOMAN] Conversely, if your
goal is scored upon,

133
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,250
then you will lose one point.

00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,458
Very well, then.

Hmm?

151
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,291
[SHIMADA] I remembered that
my sister and I played this

152
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,083
a long time ago.

153
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,125
We lost our parents when
we were pretty young.

00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,666
Money was always tight.

155
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,916
So we tried to drag out the
game by keeping a rally going.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,291
[TATSUMI]
Oh?

157
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,833
Unfortunately, the time
ran out on us. That's right.

158
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,416
We didn't know the thing

Not exactly a good surprise.

My sister was inconsolable.

161
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,458
It took me forever to
get her to stop crying.

162
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,583
What about now? You still play?

163
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,791
No, we don't.

164
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,000
My sister is actually
in high school now,

165
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,166
and since I started
working, I'm so busy.

166
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,833

How old are you, Shimada?

I'm 22 now.

168
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:57,375
I started working right after
I graduated from high school.

00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:01,333
I get it. Sounds like you
put your sister first.

Pardon me, are you
perhaps not feeling well?

It's not that.

00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,375
It's the remote. I don't
want you to use it.

00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,750
I know that it bothers you.

174
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,666
As it happens, it's actually
broken at the moment.

worried this time

176
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,875
because of the killing?

177
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,291
Just imagine what could happen.

178
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,375
Things get out of hand
even when normal people

179
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,875
go through this.

180
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,083
Maybe, but killers
are still people.

181
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:39,291
How are you supposed to
make a legitimate judgment?

182
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,083
Killer or innocent,
there is no one

183
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,583
who cannot be judged.

184
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:46,125
Whatever happens,
I will judge them.

185
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,041
[sighs]

186
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,625
It's one wacky thing after
another in this place, isn't it?

187
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,500
I wish I knew what the
deal was with this game.

188
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,583
[SHIMADA]
Huh? You don't know anything?

189
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,666
When you asked me to
cooperate, I assumed you did.

190
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,250
How can I explain this to you?

191
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,666
Tell me something.

192
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,708
What do you think's the
hardest part about what I do?

193
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,416
Uh... I don't know.

194
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,583
The long hours?
Or somethin' like that.

195
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,958
[TATSUMI] It's not the
time or physical stress.

196
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,875
The cases my division handles
are the serious ones.

197
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,333
We see some real heavy
emotions on a daily basis.

198
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,791
Real heavy emotions,
huh? Like what?

199
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,541
Well, for example,
there's the grief

200
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,541
of the victim's family
after their loved one

201
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,041
has been murdered.
That's always rough.

202
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,666
I'm telling ya, it takes
a lot out of you to confront

203
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,833
that kind of emotion.

204
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,666
Earlier, I talked
about judging people

205
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,125
by their eyes, but something
is off about that guy.

206
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:01,166
As far as I can tell,
he doesn't feel anything.

207
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,041
I've never met anybody
like that before,

208
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,000
to be honest.
Can't figure him out.

209
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,750
All right, kid.
Back to the game.

210
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:14,500
Wait! Can you explain something?
Why are we even playing at all?

211
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,625
'Cause if we keep going,

212
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,750
we might actually
find something out.

213
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,333
Something like what?

214
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,500
[TATSUMI] About the game,
maybe. About the guy.

215
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,666
But I'm not interested in that.

216
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,375
Not in the game,
or the white-haired guy.

217
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,291
I said that I would cooperate

218
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,875
because I thought you were
gonna get us outta here.

219
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,500
Yeah. I get it.

220
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:38,000
Just hang in there a
little longer for me.

221
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,583
I'm not like you, though.

222
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,416
You don't seem to get
frightened by anything.

223
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,000
[TATSUMI]
I get scared sometimes.

224
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,583
But right now, it doesn't matter
whether we're afraid or not.

225
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,916
Till we end this game,
one way or another,

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,625
we're not gettin' out
of this damn place.

227
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,166
[SHIMADA]
Fine. Let's do it.

228
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,416
[SHIMADA]
Congratulations.

229
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,375
[SAE] That means a lot
from my big brother.

230
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,583
Look at you. You sure
have grown up, huh?

231
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:18,375
[laughs] Don't start
crying on me!

232
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,833
I promise, I'll do my best.

233
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,875
[TATSUMI]
What's wrong?

234
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,625
Uh, just daydreaming.
Here we go.

239
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,750
[SHIMADA]
W-What's goin' on?

240
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,833
[TATSUMI]
No, how could I have forgotten

241
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,000
something like... that?

242
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,625
You're so pale. What's wrong?

243
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,750
Hey! Tatsumi?

244
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:38,250
[TATSUMI] I have a headache.
Give me a sec, okay?

245
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,250
[DECIM]
They're going more slowly

246
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,875
than I thought they would.

247
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,083
What?

248
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,250
Maybe the shock from
their deaths is greater.

249
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,250
Their memories seem
to be buried more deeply

250
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,791
than other guests'.

251
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,416
And we can't tamper
with what memories

252
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,583
they do recall, can we?

253
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,208
So, what are you going to do?

254
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,666
[DECIM]
Hm.

255
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,541
[WOMAN]
You could let me see them.

256
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,000
The guests' memories, I mean.

257
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,250
I'll put in a request
about that later.

258
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,708
[YUMI]
Here you go, honey.

259
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,291
What's that?

260
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,916
You are a stereotypical
detective, aren't you?

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,125
[YUMI chuckles]
My poor husband!

262
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,875
So busy, you can't even
remember your own birthday.

263
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,458
Oh, yeah. That's right.

264
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,041
Gift first. Cigarette later.

265
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,083
Yours practically had
holes in the bottom.

266
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,500
I thought you could
use a new pair.

267
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,833
[TATSUMI]
That's right. She was killed.

268
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,250
My wife was murdered.

269
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,333
[DETECTIVE 8A]
What's Tatsumi doing?

270
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,500
I thought they pulled him
from the investigation.

271
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,791
[DETECTIVE 8B] I hear he
hasn't even taken a day off.

272
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,125
[DETECTIVE 8C]
They should really move him

273
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,291
out of the division.
I can't bear to watch this.

274
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,583
[DETECTIVE 8D]
He likes a repeat offender

275
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,541
out on parole for it.

276
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,500
[DETECTIVE 8E] Tatsumi's the one
who sent him up the first time.

Yeah. Let's get back
to it, all right?

Okay, if you're... sure.

What's gotten into him?

need to take care of.

I was in the middle of it

limit has expired.

to a linked format.

For the remainder of the game,
the part of the body

320
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,958
linked to the scoring puck
will be stricken with pain.

Really? Actual pain?

322

Yes.

00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,375
In your eyes, if a puck
with an eye design scores.

324
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,708
In your heart, if a puck
with a heart design scores.

325
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,375
Now then, if we can
please continue on

say it if you don't want.

No. I can tell you.

336
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,666
It was my sister.
Somebody assaulted her.

337
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,416
[SHIMADA] There was this guy
who had been giving her

338
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,833
a lot of trouble.
A stalker, you know?

339
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:37,666
I even told the police about it.
But they didn't do anything.

340
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,666
The police wouldn't
help you? I'm sorry, kid.

341
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,250
That bastard. I can't let him...

342
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,458
...just get away with it.

Revenge, huh?

344
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,791
I know something about that.
It's what I'm after, too.

00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,500
It is?

I'm sure this isn't the
kinda thing that you'd expect

00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:02,125
to hear from a detective,
but when I get outta here...

348
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,416
[TATSUMI]
...somebody is going to die.

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,708
[whimpers]

350
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,208
[TATSUMI] My wife, you see.
She was murdered.

351
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,708
That's right. Yes,
thank you very much.

352
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,375
They said it would
be no trouble.

353
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,833
It should be on its
way here shortly.

354
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,041
Okay.

356
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:52,041
[WOMAN panting]
It wasn't just one of them?

357
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,708
They're both killers?

358
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,958
Yes, it seems so.

359
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,458
It's a weird feeling.

360
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:02,791
Seeing the memories of a killer.

For the moment,
you don't have a name,

but I can tell you
that you are an arbiter.

00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,583
What do you mean by "arbiter"?

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,208
An arbiter is someone who
judges people's souls

8
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,416
and sends them either for
reincarnation or into the void.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,208

judge assessing souls?

Number One: Arbiters cannot stop

13
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,916
making judgments, for this
task is more than their job.

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It is the entire reason
for their existence.

15
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:31,125
Number Two: Arbiters
cannot experience death,

16
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,500
for that would taint
their judgments.

17
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,500
It would make them too
close to being human.

18
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,958
Number Three: Arbiters
cannot feel emotions,

19
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,791
for doing so is not
in their natures.

20
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,166
It is impossible for a
dummy to have feelings.

this isn't judgment!

00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,291
[DECIM] I have come to believe
that the way in which

24
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,458

is fundamentally flawed.

using extreme conditions
in order to reveal

28
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,541
the darkness within the soul.

29
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,625
What if we are creating
that darkness rather than

30
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,666

175
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,333
[QUIN]
Oh, that's all well and good.

176
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,916
Different from implanting
human emotions, though, right?

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,500
Yeah, well, at this point,

178
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,166
I think all we can have Decim do
is draw on all of his judgments.

179
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,750
[QUIN]
So? Why did you come here?

180
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,208
You have her
memories from before

181
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,375
they were condensed and
compiled. Give me all of them.

182
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,583
Huh?

183
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,416
[SACHIKO]
Ooh! Another pair for me!

184
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,458
Huh?

185
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,833
My, it's almost
like magic, isn't it?

186
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,833
I'm sorry. Is
something the matter?

187
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,250
No, don't trouble yourself.

188
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,583
Looks like my victory, eh?

189
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,708
Congratulations on the win.

190
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,458
Thank you very much, dear.

191
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,875
[DECIM]
Hm?

192
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,416
[SACHIKO]
I'm going to ask you a question,

193
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,583
and I want the truth,
all right? Be honest, now.

194
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,958
Is this the afterlife?

195
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:45,958
Oh--

196
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,333
[gasps]

197
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,250
Yes.

198
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,250
I thought as much.

199
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,291
[WOMAN]
What are you doing?

200
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,625
It does not matter.

201
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,166
Huh?

202
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,000
To summarize, following death,
people's souls arrive here.

203
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,416
It is my job to pass
judgment upon them.

204
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,125
I am what's called an arbiter.

205
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,375
Ah.

206
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,375
[DECIM] When did you first
realize this was the afterlife?

207
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:12,250
Only a moment ago.
Do you see this boy here?

208
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,625
His name is Miu,
but this drawing of him

209
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,166
doesn't actually exist.

210
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,583
[DECIM, WOMAN gasp]

211
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,708
[SACHIKO] He was going to
appear in my next feature,

212
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,708
but I haven't drawn him yet.

213
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,791
As a character, he
exists only in my mind.

214
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:30,416
But here he is, just as I
imagined him! What a surprise!

215
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,083
That's what tipped me off.

216
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,291
This couldn't possibly be
the world I've always known.

217
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,291
Sorry, but you don't
seem very troubled.

218
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,416
I might feel different
about the whole situation

219
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,041
if I could remember dying.

220
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,333
[laughs] Ah, the joys
of getting old!

221
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,500
No one who comes
here remembers dying.

222
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,958
It has nothing to do
with your age.

223
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,166
If you'd like to know how
you passed, I could tell you.

224
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,166
[SACHIKO]
That's okay.

225
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,541
Huh?

226
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,916
To be honest, I suspect
I'm better off not knowing.

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,375
Thank you for this, though.

228
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,125
My time in this place has
been like a wonderful dream.

229
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,958
[gasps] Oh, really? Playing
the game, you mean?

230
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,666
Yes, dear, that's right.

231
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,125
My husband and I weren't
able to start a family

232
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,791
of our own. So the
characters I created

233
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,625
became like my children.

234
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,791
I never imagined I would
see them again like this.

235
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,666
It's been a delightful surprise.

236
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,458
My work wasn't always
easy, but I'm glad

237
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,416
I got the chance
to come face-to-face

238
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,958
with my illustrations.

239
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,541
So, you see, I'm happy I
played that game of yours.

240
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,125
It may be over now,
but at least I know

241
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,916
that I lived a full life.

242
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,083
That is a wonderful
thing to hear.

243
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,000
A full life.

244
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,583
Shall we continue on
with the game, then?

245
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,291
Ugh!

246
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,625
What are you gonna do
with her memories, anyway?

247
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,208
[NONA]
Just get them, okay?

248
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,541
[QUIN] It's not like
I'm made of time, here.

249
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,583
Do you know how many
people die every second?

250
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,208
Seems like there's
a lot in here.

251
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,625
[QUIN] Actually, it's not that
much. She died pretty early.

252
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,125
Don't concern yourself with
arbiter memory capacity

253
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,333
this time around. I want
you to recompile these.

254
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,000
Uh...

255
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,125
Here, for your trouble.

256
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,000
Uh-- Ah!

257
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,333
Ha!

258
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,333
[gasps]

259
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,000
[SACHIKO] Oh, my. I
recognize those drawings.

260
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,958
That one's Chavvot, isn't it?

261
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,416
[DECIM]
Chavvot?

262
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,166
[SACHIKO] Yes, it's the name
of a little girl character

263
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,958
in the children's
book, "Chavvot."

264
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,458
By any chance, was that
one of your works?

265
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,833
No, not mine.

266
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,708
I've just read the book
before, that's all.

267
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,041
Can you tell us what
the story is about?

268
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,416
[SACHIKO]
Well, let me see.

269
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,041
It's about this little
boy named Jimmy

270
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,166
who falls in love with Chavvot.

271
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,000
But he can't tell her because
she's unable to hear.

272
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,208
So Jimmy wishes on a star.

273
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,708
He asks that someday,
Chavvot will know

274
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,083
how he feels about her.

275
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,250
Intriguing.

276
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,583
[SACHIKO]
Think about it.

277
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,833
When you want to express
your feelings to someone,

278
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,208
how would you usually do it, eh?

279
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,750
[DECIM]
Well, uh... I...

280
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,375
Using words?

281
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,250
Exactly, my dear.

282
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,791
That's what most people think,
and I believe that's why

283
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,875
the author wrote it
so Chavvot was deaf.

284
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,250
[WOMAN, DECIM gasp]

285
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,208
We don't always realize it,
but there are so many

286
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,666
other ways of expressing our
emotions besides using words.

287
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,458
Here's an example. Take a look.

288
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,125
[DECIM]
A smile?

289
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,875
Yes. A smile is universal.

290
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,125
Wherever you're from,
it means you're happy.

291
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,500
Just like a frown shows
everyone you're unhappy.

292
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,625
It really is wondrous, isn't it?

293
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,375
A language that
everybody speaks!

294
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,666
--[GIRL] Mama!
--[gasps]

295
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,958
Mama! Read me the book again!

296
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,041
You really like
"Chavvot," don't you?

297
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,916
Yep! That okay?

298
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,041
Well, of course!
Mama likes "Chavvot," too.

299
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,458
Okay, good!

300
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,500
What part do you like most?

301
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,375
Her smile really is
terrific, isn't it?

302
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,166
You're right. That's my
favorite part too, Chi!

303
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,708
I'm pretty sure...
my name is Chiyuki.

304
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,875
[gasps]

305
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,583
[SACHIKO]
Oh! You remember your name now?

306
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,541
Yes. I don't know what
could have changed,

307
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,708
but I do!

308
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,208
And what a beautiful
name it is, my dear.

309
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,583
It's sweet of you to say so.

310
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:06,291
[CHIYUKI whimpers]

311
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,416
I remember Mom.

312
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,541
What is it? Is something wrong?

313
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,458
No. It's nothing.

314
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,958
In that case, I
believe it's my turn.

315
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,666
[DECIM]
I'm out of cards.

316
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,166
Which means, that this game
is now officially over.

317
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,875
[elevator dings]

318
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,541
Are you coming, too, Chiyuki?

319
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,083
Not yet. I'm going to
stay a little longer.

320
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,291
Ah. Take care of yourself.

321
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,500
Thanks.

322
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,166
And you're quite sure
that it's all right

323
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,583
if I take these
with me, young man?

324
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,625
[DECIM]
Yes. You're welcome to them.

325
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,583
[SACHIKO] Thank you
so much. I was thinking.

326
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,625
[gasps]

327
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,541
You know how, in
Old Maid, the person

328
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,666
who gets left with the joker
in their hand is the loser?

329
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,250
I've always found that rule
to be a rather strange one.

330
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,875
[BOTH]
Huh?

331
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,833
Just look at most
other card games.

332
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,250
The joker's usually
a trump card.

333
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:29,208
Having it left at the end
seems prudent to me.

334
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,041
Yes.

335
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,250
Well, my dears.
It's been lovely.

336
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,000
Thank you so much.

337
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,166
Thank you for playing.

338
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,208
Best of luck on your journey.

339
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,208
[CHIYUKI]
So, out with it.

340
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,375
I wanna know how it happened.

341
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:56,666
I suppose that we really
can't do it this way, can we?

342
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,875
[CLAVIS]
Here I am, Oculus, sir.

343
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,250
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

Clavis! There's my boy.

345
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,375
I'm happy to help, sir.
What can I do for you?

00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,541
avoiding me for
some reason. Tell me.

348
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,125
You play billiards, don't ya?

349
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,500
No, I'm sorry sir, but I can't.

350
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,208
I'm only jokin'.

351
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,625
[OCULUS] Hang tight. This
should only take a second.

352
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,666
Isn't that just fascinating.

353
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,416
An arbiter with human emotions.

354
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,083
Sorry about that.

355
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,500
What?

356
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,666
We're all done here.
You can go now.

357
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,125
Oh, all right. Thank you.
I'll get going, then.

358
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,750
[OCULUS]
How utterly pointless.

359
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,958
[DECIM] You know. I don't
believe people live

360
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,833
just so that they
can die someday.

361
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,333
I think it's because
they are alive

362
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,458
that they must die
at some point.

363
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,791
[CHIYUKI]
Hmm.

364
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,208
I believe that there is
a purpose to being alive.

365
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,500
[gasps]

366
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,666
And there's a purpose
to judgment, as well.

367
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,333
Judging is tricky.
Difficult to do right.

368
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,250
It goes hand-in-hand
with both life and death.

369
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,958
By its very nature, it must
be performed hand-in-hand

370
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,833
with human beings.

371
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:22,833
And because of that, it
requires human emotions.

372
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,708
[CHIYUKI gasps]

373
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,625
Chiyuki, please.

374
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,125
Sorry?

375
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,916
If you don't mind.

376
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,416
I need you to fill in
the blanks for me.

377
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,041
What?

378
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,416
Huh.

379
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,041

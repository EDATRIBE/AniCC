00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,875
Please, don't do it!

00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,291

Stop!

Dr. Nakamura, Code Blue. ICU.

23
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:12,041
Until recently, a viral agent
has been the suspected cause

24
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,625
behind a string of incidents in
which have left some high school

25
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,875
students in a comatose state.

26
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,958
[NEWS ANCHOR] But, according
to some new information

27
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,458
we just received,

28
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,583
all of the victims of this
strange affliction, apparently

29
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,583
all went to the same private
middle school in Tokyo.

30
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,458
Authorities are now questioning
the faculty and staff members of

31
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,875
the private middle school.
As well as, focusing their

32
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,416
investigation on previous
interactions the victims

33
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,416
might have had with one another.

34
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,083
[YUUYA] Is this that crazy
"spiritual healing" stuff?

35
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,958
Yeah. But after seeing demons
and all that other crazy shit,

36
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,083
we should be the last
people to doubt her powers.

37
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,416
It appears that your friend has
had her consciousness imprisoned

38
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,458
in someone else's mindscape.
Someone with considerable power.

39
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,791
Mindscape?

40
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,750
[IWAYAMA]
Very powerful mental powers.

41
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,333
This person seems
to have an extremely

42
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,625
strong hold on your friend.

43
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,375
[KYOICHI] That sure doesn't
sound like you're average person

44
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,333
off the streets, huh?

45
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,208
[YUUYA]
Which means...

46
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,916
[TATSUMA]
It's someone who has the Power.

47
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,958
Who the hell would do this?

48
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,625
[IWAYAMA] In any case, if she
remains in this comatose state,

49
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,750
her body will break down and
she will die.

50
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,416
Her life is in danger.

51
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,708
Come on, you can do something,
can't you?! I mean, I believe

52
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:35,500
that's why we came to this
freakshow of a hospital!

53
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,708
[IWAYAMA] Well! Seems you've
learned to use that mouth

54
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,416
of yours quite well.
I remember a certain little

55
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,833
brat, who used to come to
me whining and crying.

56
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,708
No need to bring up
stupid stuff from the past!

57
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,375
[IWAYAMA] Alright, settle down,
the important thing right now is

58
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,791
for you to find out how to save
your friend, is that right?

59
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,708
Unfortunately, all
we can do right now

60
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,875
is provide
emergency treatment.

61
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,583
So, what do you mean?

62
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,916
The only thing I can do is to
attempt to stop the other

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,208
person's thoughts from fully
imprisoning her consciousness.

64
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,291
[IWAYAMA] To save her,
you'll have to find whoever

65
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:11,083
is behind this and stop
that person yourselves.

66
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,541
And you'll want to do that
as quickly as possible.

67
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,583
What if this person
really does have the Power?

68
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,958
We have to
stop whoever this is,

69
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,166
even if it means
we have to kill 'em.

70
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,625
[KOMAKI] But at
this rate, Aoi could...

71
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,541
Hey, have you been able to get
ahold of Kisaragi yet?

72
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,416
[KOMAKI] I've
called him a dozen times!

73
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Where the hell could
he be at a time like this?

74
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,916
[dog whimpers]

75
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,541
[dog barks]

76
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,125
Go ahead.

77
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:15,291
[MAIKO]
Look! A doggie...

78
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,500
It was just there in front of
the hospital.

79
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,750
[KYOICHI]
Huh? A dog?

80
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,708
[IWAYAMA]
Oh, don't mind her.

81
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,000
Maiko sees all sorts of
spirits and other things.

82
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,333
Do you mean,
like, ghosts and stuff?

83
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,750
[MAIKO]
Mmmhmm.

84
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,625
I sense that he really wants to
see her pretty badly.

85
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,583
[ANKO]
Hmmm...

86
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,875
In the city... a baffling string
of unexplained comas...

87
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,458
Students of the same
private middle school...

00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,166

Here it is.

[phone ringing]

91
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,541
[ANKO] Hello, I'm with
the Kagura Middle School

92
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,833
Alumni Association.

93
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,416
In fact, I'm a
graduate of Kagura myself...

94
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,708
I was hoping to ask you a
couple of questions about our

95
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,375
old middle school days.

96
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,458
[ANKO'S MOM] Kyoko!
Where do you think you're

97
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,958
going at this hour
of the night?!

98
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,791
[ANKO] I'm going
out for a walk, Mom!

99
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,041
[phone ringing]

100
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,458
[KOMAKI] Anko?
Aoi's is still unconscious.

101
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,791
We're at the hospital right now.

102
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,500
Huh? What?

103
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,833
[YUUYA] So... Anko said
to meet her in Tsukimidai

104
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,250
as soon as possible.

105
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,791
[KOMAKI] She didn't tell
me any details, but she said

106
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,000
it's got something to do with
what's going on with Aoi.

107
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,291
I want to find
out what's going on.

108
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,750
[KYOICHI] No worries!
Princess will be fine as long

109
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,333
as The Old Lady
watching over her!

110
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,958
[IWAYAMA] We must make sure
this holds until they find

111
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,625
the location
of the spell caster.

112
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,291
[MAIKO]
Right!

113
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,875
This is the guy! This is
the guy who's responsible

114
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,333
for putting Aoi in a coma!

115
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,125
Uh... Who's he?

116
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,958
[ANKO] Reiji Sagaya. He's the
one who's behind all those

117
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,458
high school students
falling into comas!

118
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,708
[YUUYA] H-How do
you know all this?!

119
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,375
[condescending laugh]

120
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:45,791
[ANKO] I am the soon-to-be
journalist phenom... Kyoko Tono.

121
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,875
When it comes to
students in the Tokyo area,

122
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,958
I know all about them!
I know their test scores,

123
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,000
I know everything
from what's in your lunch,

124
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,708
right down to the
holes in your socks!

125
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,125
What?...Really?! Wow.

126
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,125
[ANKO] All of the students
who've fallen into comas

127
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,958
were bullies from Kagura
Middle School.

128
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,208
And their main target of their
bullying was Reiji Sagaya.

129
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,583
Rumor has it that they were
pretty mean and ruthless

130
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:20,875
with him. It's surprising that
none of this was discovered.

131
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,208
[groans]

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,625
[blow lands]

133
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,958
[muffled grunting]

134
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:02,541
[muffled screaming]

135
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,625
[ANKO] Sagaya hasn't set
foot outside his house

136
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,208
since middle school.

137
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,541
But, since last spring,
rumor has been going around,

138
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,000
among the guys who
used to bully Sagaya,

139
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,333
that he's going
to come after each and

140
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,666
every one of them and get
even... in their dreams!

141
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,583
His parents even treat
him like some kind of monster

142
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,875
or something.

143
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,666
[KYOICHI]
This past spring?

144
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,375
In their dreams, huh?

145
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,750
If he really is another person
with this Power we all have what

146
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,041
you're saying can really happen.

147
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,750
But why is he after Aoi?
Why is he involving Aoi

148
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,125
and making her go
through all this?

149
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,500
[ANKO] I don't know...
But, Aoi also went to

150
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,291
Ka-gu-ra Middle School!

151
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,708
There's gotta be
some kind of connection.

152
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,708
[KYOICHI] Okay, then we have
to find out where he lives!

153
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,000
[ANKO]
Hold one second!

154
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,166
[KYOICHI]
Huh?

155
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,000
Why do you think
I've called you all here?

156
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:59,791
This is where he
lives! Unit #504.

157
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,833
Thank you, Anko.

158
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,458
Alright, let's do it!

159
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,291
[KOMAKI]
Kyoko...

160
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,750
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,583
I thought you...

162
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,875
No need to say it, I know!
Even if it would be the scoop

163
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,000
of the century,
your secret's safe with me,

164
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,916
so don't worry, okay!

165
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,666
[KOMAKI]
Huh?

166
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,958
A secret team of
justice fighters battling

167
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,083
the forces of evil,
now that's hot!

168
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,750
Do you think I'd let
anyone else in on that?

169
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,666
From now on,
I'm going to devote my time

170
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,583
to covering your story.

171
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,541
Don't worry! No one will know
it's you guys! But in return,

172
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:42,750
I get exclusive rights on the
story. You see, Komaki,

173
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:47,625
I do remember how all of you
guys saved me that night.

174
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,666
When Aoi regains consciousness,
tell her I'm sorry, okay?

175
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,333
It's not that I was afraid of
you guys. I was just a little

176
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,750
thrown off
guard, that's all.

177
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,208
[ANKO]
Tell her I said sorry.

178
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,833
If that's how you feel,
why not tell her yourself?

179
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,666
We're going to
protect Aoi no matter what!

180
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,458
Keep an eye on her
while we're gone, okay?

181
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,291
Leave it to me!

182
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,166
There was no reason.
They simply enjoyed watching

183
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:30,666
me suffer over and over.
I was a toy to them.

184
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,375
[SAGAYA] But then you,
you appeared one day.

185
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,791
[SAGAYA]
Please stop!

186
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,541
[BULLY] I hear that you
and Aoi Misato have been

187
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,708
feeding this mutt.

188
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,750
Yeah, who do you think you are
hanging around girls?

189
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,958
[SAGAYA]
No! Don't!

190
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,458
No! Don't!

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,541
[SAGAYA] It's been
three years since then

192
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,250
and not a single day went by

193
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:18,958
when I didn't think of them.
Then one day, I got my chance.

194
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,291
[strained groaning]

195
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,708
You were the only
one who was different.

196
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,500
Aoi, I will
always protect you.

197
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,583
Let's stay here
together in this world.

198
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:53,333
Aoi... Why won't you
please open your eyes?

199
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:01,458
I get it. There's someone
holding you to that other world,

200
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,000
isn't there?

201
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,000
[SAGAYA]
Let's go, Tiny.

202
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh, come on.
It was just getting good.

203
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,375
[KISARAGI] Just as I thought,
all the seals have been broken.

204
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:48,916
[EVIL MALE MASK] You...
are a Kisaragi descendent?

205
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,166
[IWAYAMA] O-in-shi-chi-ri
kya-ra-ro 

206
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,208
ha-u-un-ken so-wa-ka, 

207
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,458
O-in-shi-chi-ri kya-ra-ro 

208
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,708
ha-u-un-ken so-wa-ka, 

209
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,000
--Aoi... please hang on!
--ha-u-un-ken so-wa-ka.

210
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,208
Breaking the barrier
and getting in the perimeter

211
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,791
is quite impressive.

212
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,333
The doggie looks a little
different from earlier.

213
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,958
I won't hold back on anyone who
tries to take Aoi away from me.

214
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,875
A vengeful spirit?

215
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,208
What powerful hatred.

216
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,166
[TATSIMA]
It's okay, he's alive.

217
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,541
[KOMAKI]
This woman is okay, too.

218
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,250
It's as if they're sleeping.

219
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,833
[KYOICHI] I've got
a bad feeling about this.

220
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,916
[YUUYA]
He might be in there?

221
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,291
[TATSUMA]
What's that?

222
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,916
[SAGAYA]
Someone's getting too nosey.

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,625
Tiny, you take care of this.

224
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,833
It appears that our young
friends have located the body.

225
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,875
[SAGAYA]
Welcome to My Dream World.

226
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,750
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

227
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,625
Let go!

228
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,208
Aoi! 

229
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,791
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

230
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,125
[SAGAYA] I'm sorry, but Aoi is
mine. I won't hand her over

231
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,083
to just anyone.

232
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,750
You bastard!

233
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,291
Newsflash, asshole
she doesn't belong to you.

234
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,958
So get your hands
off her, freak!

235
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,875
You have no idea what you've
got yourselves into, do you?

236
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,291
[SAGAYA] If you die in this
world you die in the real world.

237
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,750
And the four of you will die.

238
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,708
[reverberating footsteps]

239
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,083
[KYOICHI]
Wh-What in the hell?

240
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,083
[all scream]

241
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,875
[IWAYAMA] Oinshichiri
kyararo hauunken sowaka,

242
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,583
Oinshichiri kyara...

243
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,083
[ANKO]
Aoi!

244
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,500
[Inwayama screams]

245
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,458
[ANKO] Let me tell you
something about journalists:

246
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,708
We'll risk our lives anytime.

247
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,500
and I'll never give
Aoi over to you!

248
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,625
Daigo, Sakurai...
you guys alright?

249
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,333
[YUUYA]
Yeah! We're okay!

250
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:46,166
Hey guys! This is just a dream!
Focus your minds!

251
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,333
N-No way! This is my dream!

252
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,333
[KYOICHI] Too bad for you,
we're pretty "strong minded."

253
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,750
So we're not gonna fall
for your little freak show.

254
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,250
[IWAYAMA]
Takamizawa!

255
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,708
[MAIKO]
Please... stop this!

256
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:34,250
You were very sad, weren't
you? And full of so much pain.

257
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,583
Fu-ru-be, yu-ra-yu-ra...

258
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,791
You're free now.
You mustn't let the hatred

259
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,625
within you hold you forever.

260
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,250
Understand?
Now return to your true self.

261
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,458
[MAIKO] Go and save the
people who are dear to you.

262
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,958
[IWAYAMA] Release this
departed soul, begone.

263
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,375
Release this
departed soul, begone.

264
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:33,375
Release this
departed soul, begone. Now.

265
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,750
If they keep coming back like
this, this will take forever!

266
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,208
[KYOICHI]
Tatsuma!

267
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,708
--Tatsuma!
--Hiyuu!

268
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,000
[KYOICHI]
Tatsuma! Get him!

269
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,750
Kyoichi...

270
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:45,833
Tiny? Why did you
come back? What about Aoi?

271
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,458
Why didn't you
bring Aoi with you?!

272
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:52,708
[dog whining]

273
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,958
[AOI]
Reiji, please stop this.

274
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,416
Doing this won't
save you or Tiny.

275
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,250
Aoi!

276
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,791
[AOI] This isn't
really what you want.

277
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,041
You should know
better than anyone.

278
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't want anyone, especially
a friend to go through such

279
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:28,083
sorrow ever again! I can't
forgive people who harm others

280
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,750
just for amusement,
or who would take the life

281
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,458
of an innocent, little creature.

282
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:38,750
Be strong and courageous.
Put aside your hatred!

283
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,500
Be better than they were.

284
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:51,083
No. I... I don't care what
happens to me! But I at least...

285
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,083
I wanted to protect
Tiny at the very least!

286
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,583
[SAGAYA] Tiny! I'm sorry
I couldn't protect you.

287
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,333
I'm so... sorry.

288
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:09,375
I wanted to be strong... enough
to protect the ones I care for.

289
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,208
I wanted to be strong!

290
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,375
[AOI] You can change.
I know you can.

291
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:19,000
Use this power to
protect people instead.

292
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,208
[KYOICHI]
Great, what now?!

293
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,625
[TATSUMA]
Your dream world is collapsing.

294
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,083
[SAGAYA]
Thank you... Aoi...

295
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,541
[REPORTER] A follow-up story,
the high school students who had

296
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:48,166
unexplainably fallen into
comatose states five days ago

297
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,625
have all made a
full recovery as of...

298
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,791
[IWAYAMA] They seem
to be doing just fine.

299
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:56,625
We'll take care
of him here for a bit.

300
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,791
[KYOICHI] Look at him with that
peaceful smile on his face...

301
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,625
It seems like
his soul is saved now.

302
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:11,625
[ANKO] Aoi!
Oh, thank goodness!

303
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,375
The "Dream Master"...
What a joke.

304
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,250
None of these
"people" are of any use!

305
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:36,041
Well... now getting back
to my brave little friend.

306
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,791
[KISARAGI]
So I was right... It is them.

307
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,958
[TENDO]
I'm sorry to say this concludes

308
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,291
our business for today.

309
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,458
Until next time.

1
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:16,208
[AOI] Don't die! Live!

2
01:00:16,291 --> 01:00:17,750
Please...

3
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:20,791
Live! Live!

4
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:05,250
[SAYO] Tatsuma.

5
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:10,000
Sorry I'm late.

6
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,375
[KOMAKI sighs]

7
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:22,125
Just look at all
those underclassmen,

8
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:24,083
just full of energy.

9
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,083
Must be nice...

10
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,125
[KOMAKI] God, I wanna
draw my bow again!

11
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:31,958
[KYOUICHI] Look,
it's never gonna happen!

12
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:33,000
I mean, we're all out of here

13
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,500
at the end of
September, remember?

14
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,500
[KOMAKI] How can a guy
who's never joined a club

15
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:38,208
in his life know how it feels?

16
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:41,750
You don't understand how hard it
is for me to watch and not do!

17
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:44,083
[KYOUICHI] Hey,
leggo of me, She-male!

18
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:47,041
Dude, your little lady-husband's
freaking out on me!

19
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:48,750
[YUUYA] Sakurai,
have you tried this?!

20
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,041
It's a brand new flavor,
mint-pineapple!

21
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:53,750
[KOMAKI] What?
Ooh, it does look good.

22
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:54,458
[YUUYA] Doesn't it?

23
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:55,375
[KOMAKI] But what is it?

24
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:56,375
[YUUYA]
It's a new kind of gum.

25
01:02:56,458 --> 01:02:57,875
[KOMAKI] Gum?
I think I'll pass.

26
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,250
[YUUYA] Oh, come on,
try a little piece.

27
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:01,250
[KOMAKI] Ugh, no way!
It's pineapple gum--

28
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:02,583
[YUUYA] But, I went
out and bought it

29
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:03,958
--[KOMAKI] Oh. Hi, Aoi.
--[YUUYA] for you to try.

30
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:05,583
[KYOUICHI]
Are you finally done?

31
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:09,125
[AOI] Yeah. I'm sorry
I kept you all waiting.

32
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:11,291
[YUUYA] All right...
Let's get going.

33
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,291
[KOMAKI] Hey, Aoi. Don't you
think we stepped down

34
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:15,375
too early this year?

35
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,750
Huh? You mean
from club activities?

36
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,375
[KOMAKI]
Yeah. I mean, sheesh,

37
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:21,500
I'm so out of shape right now.

38
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,333
[KISARAGI] With all the recent
appearances of the demons,

39
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:32,125
I've made a chart of
where all the incidents

40
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,833
have been occuring.

41
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,500
[KOMAKI] Wow, so many.

42
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:37,791
[YUUYA] Looks like the attacks
increased all at once,

43
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:41,625
spreading out from the area
near Sakuragaoka Hospital.

44
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:44,208
Since nightmare-boy Sagaya.

45
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,750
[KISARAGI] Yes, that, and
last month's incident

46
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,250
with the blonde high school
girl, Sera Rikudo...

47
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,250
But the curious thing
is that since then,

48
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:55,916
the demons haven't
shown themselves once.

49
01:03:57,916 --> 01:03:59,000
[KOMAKI] You don't think
they've given up on

50
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:01,708
attacking Tokyo, do you?

51
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,208
I mean, that'd
be pretty awesome,

52
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:05,416
don't you think, Aoi?

53
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,958
Yeah. That would... be nice.

54
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,750
Tch. I wouldn't
hold my breath.

55
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:16,250
Kozunu... Tendo Kozunu.

56
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:18,708
[KISARAGI] Yes. It does
seem fairly unlikely

57
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:21,666
that he would drop his
vendetta just like that.

58
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,291
I'm sure it will be
only a matter of time

59
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:25,916
before he comes up
with a new plan.

60
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:30,625
Perhaps he's... in the
process of carrying one out.

61
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,166
[YUUYA] So all we do now
is sit around patiently

62
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,875
for the enemy to
show up again, huh?

63
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:48,916
[KYOUICHI chuckles]

64
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,500
Well, when it finally comes,

65
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:53,041
I'm gonna be ready to go
on one hell of a rampage.

66
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:55,625
[KOMAKI] Hey, Aoi.

67
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,416
Earth to Aoi!

68
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,083
[AOI] Huh? Oh. Sorry.

69
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:01,625
[KOMAKI] What's the matter?

70
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:05,000
[AOI] Well, I've just been kind
of busy lately, that's all.

71
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,791
[KOMAKI] You mean with the
student council transition?

72
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:09,083
[AOI] Yeah.

73
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:11,500
[KOMAKI] Oh, man,
you're such an overachiever.

74
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:13,250
You know, you've
really got me worried!

75
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:14,333
[AOI laughs]

76
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:17,250
I appreciate
your concern, Komaki.

77
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:18,833
[KYOUICHI] Okay... so,

78
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:21,125
how's about we grab some ramen
while we're in the area?

79
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,750
Ooh! I'm in for that!

80
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:25,625
Sure. I was just
startin' to get hungry.

81
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:27,166
Whaddaya say, Aoi,
you comin' with us?

82
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,125
There's nothing like a hot,
steaming bowl of ramen

83
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:31,375
when you're feeling
down in the dumps. Right?

84
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:32,875
Heh. I guess
you're right.

85
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:34,416
[TATSUMA] Well, I think
I'll be heading home.

86
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,750
[ALL] Huh?

87
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:37,958
See you guys tomorrow, okay?

88
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:46,166
Hey, what's up with him?

89
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:47,666
[ANKO giggles]

90
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,416
Would you like the scoop?

91
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,291
[KYOUICHI] Oh crap... Anko.

92
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:54,125
What's that supposed to mean?!

93
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:57,125
[metal clangs]

94
01:05:57,208 --> 01:06:00,916
Ha! The reason Tatsuma's
in such a hurry is this.

95
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,458
[ANKO] Ta-dah!

96
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,208
[KYOUICHI]
Hey, could that be...

97
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:07,416
[YUUYA]
Is he on a... date?!

98
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,791
[KOMAKI] Awww...

99
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:11,875
Look at Tatsuma and his date.
They look so sweet.

100
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:15,291
[KYOUICHI] That girl...

101
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:16,458
[ANKO laughs]

102
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:18,458
I'll bet you're surprised.

103
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,166
I'll bet you never suspected
that Tatsuma would have

104
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:24,083
a secret like this, did you?

105
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:25,583
[ANKO]
Her name is Sayo Hirasaka.

106
01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:28,375
She's in Class 2-5 at Sakurazuka
High School in Shinagawa.

107
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:31,291
She's 5'6" and weighs 93 pounds.
And her measurements...

108
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:32,666
...are a secret.

109
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:33,875
Who gives a damn.

110
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:34,750
[ANKO] No offense.

111
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:36,500
Mmm.

112
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:39,125
[ANKO] Also, she enjoys
watching TV drama series.

113
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:43,666
And her favorite word
is... "reincarnation."

114
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:47,541
[KYOUICHI] Reincarnation?

115
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:49,708
That's, like, got something
to do with religion, right?

116
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:52,041
[YUUYA] Master Arai
told me about that.

117
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:55,083
It's the idea that souls
are reborn again and again,

118
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:58,833
and continue to wander this
world of confusion and pain.

119
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:00,916
[KOMAKI] What else?

120
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,041
[ANKO] Well,
this is interesting.

121
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:07,666
Both her parents died during
that whole crow-attack thing.

122
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,000
She somehow managed
to survive it,

123
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:12,000
but from what I hear,
she's been in the hospital

124
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:14,291
until just recently.

125
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:16,208
[KOMAKI] I see...

126
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,583
What's the matter with you?

127
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:23,458
You've got the
grumpiest face right now.

128
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:25,500
Uh, it's nothin'.

129
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,833
[ANKO] Anyway, she's got
relatives nearby in Izu

130
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:30,250
who are planning
on taking her in.

131
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,541
[gasps]

132
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:34,875
[ANKO] Oh, no!

133
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:36,875
I just can't sit around
eating ramen all day!

134
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:39,500
I was in the middle of
investigating a big scoop!

135
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:41,000
I'll let you
take care of the tab!

136
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,166
[KYOUICHI] Huh?

137
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,333
[ANKO] Consider it
payment for the info.

138
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:47,000
Man. I tell you what,
that girl's gonna be

139
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:48,250
[KYOUICHI]
one hell of a teleporter.

140
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,500
[YUUYA and KOMAKI] Reporter!

141
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,583
[KYOUICHI] Shut up!
I know what I'm sayin'!

142
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:54,083
[whimpers softly]

143
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,583
Are you all right there, miss?

144
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:58,166
[AOI sobbing]
--Hey...

145
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,750
Aoi?

146
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:01,791
[chuckles]

147
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:11,208
[GRANDFATHER] Hisui,
listen to me carefully.

148
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:13,500
It is about time
that you also learned

149
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:19,250
of our family's "other"
mission, which we must uphold!

150
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:21,375
It is said that
at times, one appears

151
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:23,958
who has the power to
read the Dragon Stream.

152
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:26,875
This person can discern
who are the chosen among us

153
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:29,083
and lead them
to eternal salvation.

154
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:31,666
That individual often
holds great power

155
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,291
in whatever era they exist,

156
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:36,416
and this is a source
of much conflict.

157
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,625
They're known as
the Bodhisattva Eye!

158
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:44,458
Hisui, listen to me
carefully and don't forget

159
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:47,500
that if the one who
possesses that star of fate

160
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:51,500
ever appears to you,
you must immediately...

161
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,333
[KISARAGI] Lady Aoi...

162
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:01,416
[KYOUICHI] Man...
when you look at it up close,

163
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,125
it's pretty damn amazing.

164
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:06,375
Thanks I should be
all right from here on.

165
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,083
[KYOUICHI] Right.

166
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:11,916
Well, then you have
a good night, okay?

167
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,833
[AOI] Thanks so much for
walking me back, Kyouichi.

168
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:16,333
[KYOUICHI] Sure.

169
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:26,333
[KYOUICHI] Aoi!

170
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:27,791
[gasps]

171
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:32,083
Don't let everything
weigh you down.

172
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:37,083
[KYOUICHI] If anything happens,
then say so. Got it?

173
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:57,791
[chanting]

174
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:00,916
[gasps]

175
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:08,958
Why, good evening.

176
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:10,125
[gasps]

177
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:11,916
Tendo Kozunu,
what are you doing here?!

178
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,750
[TENDO] You don't
look happy to see me.

179
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:18,333
That bitter expression
is ruining your pretty face.

180
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:20,541
What are you doing here?

181
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:24,375
That's one good question.

182
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:27,083
[TENDO] As a matter of fact,
I'm here this time

183
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:29,083
to give my regards.

184
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:30,583
Regards?

185
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:32,458
Yes.

186
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:34,583
Mm.

187
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:39,250
This power.
You're terrified of it.

188
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:41,000
[TENDO] You've felt
something powerful

189
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:43,625
squirming inside you,
haven't you?

190
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:47,416
But you're pretending
you're not aware of it.

191
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,916
Stop it...

192
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,041
[TENDO] Your power
is bringing misfortune

193
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:53,583
to everyone around you.

194
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:54,916
It seems like wherever you go,

195
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,208
people are getting hurt,
and some of them

196
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:59,833
are even losing their lives.

197
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:04,000
[AOI] That's not...

198
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:06,458
That has nothing
to do with me!

199
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:09,916
[TENDO] I'm the only one
who can help you control it.

200
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,333
This little power of yours
needs harnessing.

201
01:11:12,416 --> 01:11:14,375
So what do you say?

202
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:17,291
I just wanna protect--
I wanna protect them.

203
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:19,208
I don't want
anyone else hurt.

204
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:21,750
That's all the more reason,
don't you think?

205
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:24,458
Just come along with me
and you'll be able to...

206
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:27,291
protect everyone in the world.

207
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:30,083
All of your friends
and everyone in this city...

208
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:31,958
can be safe.

209
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,500
[TENDO] Well, I guess
hearing all that is enough

210
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,833
to make your
head spin, huh?

211
01:11:37,916 --> 01:11:41,166
But it's the truth,
my little Aoi.

212
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:46,125
If you really do want to save
Tokyo, just say the word.

213
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:49,041
I can come
to you any time.

214
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:53,291
Sooner or later your fate's
going to catch up with you.

215
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:56,541
Just try to remember
that much at least,

216
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:59,000
Aoi Misato.

217
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:12,208
[AOI] Yes. Okay. I'll see
you tomorrow night, then.

218
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:38,916
[STUDENTS chattering]

219
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,250
[sighs]

220
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:41,750
Huh?

221
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:46,750
[INUGAMI] Take her to
Sakuragaoka Central Hospital.

222
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:49,916
I'll take full responsibility.

223
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,333
[KYOUICHI] Who is
that geezer anyway?

224
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,166
[KYOUICHI] Yo.

225
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,291
Hey, Kyouichi.

226
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:05,500
[KYOUICHI] It looks like you're
in quite a hurry there, man.

227
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,583
[TATSUMA] Yeah. Gotta take
care of some stuff.

228
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:09,708
[KYOUICHI] I see...

229
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:11,291
"Stuff," huh?

230
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,666
[TATSUMA] Yeah.

231
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:18,833
You, uh... you know, right?

232
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:22,625
I can't talk.
I have to get going.

233
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:25,583
Uh!

234
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:27,375
Tatsuma!

235
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:35,916
Sheesh!

236
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:38,000
[KYOUICHI]
It's not like they'll never

237
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,666
see each other again.

238
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:44,708
[ANKO humming]

239
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:47,333
[ANKO] I've been running
nothing but scary stories

240
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:50,166
on the front page lately.
I guess I can't forget about

241
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:53,791
my female readers,
though, can I?

242
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:55,541
Hmm...

243
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:01,583
[AOI] This is...

244
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:03,791
[TATSUMA] It's my destiny.

245
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:05,666
[TENDO] Sooner or later
your fate's going to

246
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,333
catch up with you.

247
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:10,041
Just try to remember
that much at least,

248
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:12,333
Aoi Misato.

249
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:14,833
[AOI] My fate?

250
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:18,125
Is it the same for Tatsuma?

251
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,833
[groans]

252
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:30,000
[SAYO sighs]

253
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:33,291
I guess I've gotta say goodbye
to this city, too, huh?

254
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:36,000
[TATSUMA] We can see each
other again any time.

255
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:43,541
[TATSUMA] Here,
just what you requested.

256
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:47,541
Ah! I can't believe
you remembered!

257
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:49,583
And this one tells time.

258
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:50,541
[gasps]

259
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,500
[SAYO] Oh, Tatsuma...!

260
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:59,250
Huh... So how does this
thing take a picture?

261
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:01,541
Oh. You should
stand back.

262
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:02,791
What?

263
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:04,250
--[SAYO] Uh...
--[camera shutter]

264
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,666
[SAYO]
Tatsuma, you're so funny.

265
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,166
[TATSUMA] I am?

266
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,083
[TATSUMA] Um...

267
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,250
[SAYO] Huh?

268
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:15,333
[TATSUMA] You know
those flowers you took

269
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:17,041
to the graveyard
yesterday...?

270
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:18,500
[SAYO] The sweet peas?

271
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:20,958
[TATSUMA] Yeah. You know
people don't usually

272
01:15:21,041 --> 01:15:22,958
put those on graves, right?

273
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:25,833
[SAYO] They were my
mom's favorite flower.

274
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:29,375
[SAYO] My uncle's family
that I'll be living with,

275
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:33,416
well, he told me that they
grow sweet peas on their farm.

276
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,750
I've been there once,

277
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,583
but I was so young
I don't remember.

278
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,708
[SAYO] He told me the
flowers would be in bloom

279
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:41,625
all December long.

280
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:44,333
I can't wait to see them.

281
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:48,458
[TATSUMA] Sure.
That sounds beautiful.

282
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,500
[AOI gasps]

283
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:54,958
That's Tatsuma.

284
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:14,666
[KISARAGI chants]

285
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,416
Houraiji. Why are you here?

286
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,833
[KYOUICHI] Heh.

287
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:29,000
I got a bad feeling when I saw
you close up shop early.

288
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:30,500
So I follow you a little ways

289
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:33,750
and I catch you pulling out
that lethal weapon there.

290
01:16:33,833 --> 01:16:35,791
You know, I really
hate it when people try an'

291
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:38,500
keep secrets from me.

292
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:39,500
[KYOUICHI] You're the
one who told me to

293
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:41,583
nose around
for stuff like this.

294
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,083
So how 'bout
you just 'fess up

295
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,208
and give it to me straight?

296
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,708
[KYOUICHI]
Say something, dammit.

297
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,375
[KISARAGI grunts]

298
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:55,750
[KYOUICHI huffs]
It's about Aoi, isn't it?

299
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,833
[KYOUICHI] Kisaragi.

300
01:16:58,916 --> 01:17:00,958
What's going on
with Aoi right now?

301
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:03,166
What are you tryin' to do?

302
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:08,541
[KIARAGI] The power which
Lady Aoi possesses...

303
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:12,000
What about it?
Tell me about Aoi's power?

304
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:17,166
[KISARAGI]
The Bodhisattva Eye.

305
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:18,583
[KYOUICHI]
The Bodhisattva Eye?

306
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,708
What's that supposed to be?

307
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:22,125
[KISARAGI] It's an
accursed power that will

308
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:24,041
lead to the
world's destruction.

309
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:25,666
At least that's what
it's supposed to do.

310
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:27,500
[KYOUICHI]
What? Destruction?

311
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:29,291
But...

312
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:32,375
doesn't that make Aoi
part of the problem, then?

313
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:34,625
Has she been protecting
Tokyo with the rest of us

314
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:37,041
or hasn't she?!

315
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:40,583
The incidents with the demons
have been part of a plan.

316
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:42,916
[KISARAGI] I believe that
plan is to awaken Aoi's...

317
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,625
or rather, the Bodhisattva
Eye's long-dormant power.

318
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:52,000
In the hope of finally
awakening that power,

319
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:54,250
Kozunu sent the demons here.

320
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:57,208
[KISARAGI] He's been slowly
leading Tokyo into chaos!

321
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,000
[gasps]

322
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:03,166
Hisui, listen to me
carefully and don't forget

323
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:06,041
that if the one who
possesses that star of fate

324
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:10,125
ever appears to you,
you must immediately...

325
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,750
[KYOUICHI] So what are
you gonna do about it?

326
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:15,833
[KISARAGI] That kind of power
must never exist in this world.

327
01:18:15,916 --> 01:18:17,166
...kill that person,

328
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,708
regardless of what their
circumstances may be!

329
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,750
[GRANDFATHER] This person must
be vanquished by the hand

330
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:25,833
of a Kisaragi before the
Dragon Stream is disrupted!

331
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:27,291
[KISARAGI] Naturally,
we can't allow them

332
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:29,250
to get their hands on her.

333
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,375
Then what you're sayin'...

334
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,708
is that you're
gonna kill Aoi?!

335
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,666
Heh. It was naïve of me
ever to have trusted you

336
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,541
in the first place.

337
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:46,291
Hey, Pasty. Get ready
to meet your maker.

338
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:47,916
You simpleton.

339
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,375
What would you
know about duty?

340
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:51,875
[BOTH grunt]

341
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,375
[KYOUICHI] You promised--

342
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:07,708
[KYOUICHI] Aah!

343
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,125
[gasps]

344
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:22,416
[KYOUICHI] You promised
you'd protect her!

345
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:28,416
[KYOUICHI] So I guess
that was all just a lie?

346
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:33,083
And instead of doing
what you said you would...

347
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:36,916
you came out here to slice
your gut open like a coward.

348
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,791
And you tell me about duty?!

349
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:42,875
This is it.
I'm done with your crap.

350
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,250
[BOTH gasp]

351
01:19:58,166 --> 01:20:03,125
Everything...
Everything was my fault?

352
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
[KISARAGI] Lady Aoi...

353
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,458
[KYOUICHI] Aoi!

354
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:13,000
All the demons and...
Is it... really all my...?

355
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:18,333
[KISARAGI] The fireflies...

356
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,750
[gasps]

357
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:30,083
--[KISARAGI] Lady Aoi...
--[KYOUICHI] Aoi!

358
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:32,625
[AOI sobbing]

359
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,458
[KYOUICHI] Aoi!

360
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,250
[AOI]
I wanna protect people?

361
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:41,166
I wanna save them?

362
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,250
More than my own life?

363
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:45,875
I had no idea
what I was saying!

364
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:47,541
I said that I wanted
to protect people,

365
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,541
but all along...

366
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:51,750
All along the one
behind it was...

367
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:52,916
[sobs]

368
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,375
[AOI] Uh...!

369
01:21:08,416 --> 01:21:15,500
[SOLDIERS] It's all your
fault. It's because of you.

370
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:17,375
[whimpers]

371
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:21,875
[YOUNG TENDO]
Mother? Mother?

372
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:24,000
Mother!

373
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:34,958
[TENDO] Stop it.
Don't come any closer!

374
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:40,041
[sighs]

375
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:47,791
[KYOUICHI] Aoi!

376
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:50,083
Aoi!

377
01:21:56,708 --> 01:22:02,250
[chiming]

378
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:04,500
What the hell--?

379
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:05,500
[gasps]

380
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:08,041
What on earth is... that?

381
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:13,666
[SAYO] Thanks for
keeping me company.

382
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:16,833
[TATSUMA] Well, I didn't
really do anything...

383
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,291
[SAYO] Tatsuma. Thank you.

384
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:21,250
[TATSUMA] Hm?

385
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:22,750
[SAYO] Well...

386
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:25,458
[beeping]

387
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:26,750
[SAYO gasps]

388
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:28,208
Goodbye.

389
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:34,541
[distant horn]

390
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:37,708
It's all right.
I'll make the trip with you.

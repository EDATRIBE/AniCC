[REPORTER] At the moment, no
detailed information has been

19
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,166
released, beyond the fact
that the victim was a student

20
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,750
from a high school in Tokyo...

[helicopter blades whirring]

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,666
[MIKURIYA] Just like you
asked for, here's one exactly

23
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,958
as it was found, no
autopsy done on it yet.

24
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,291
Too smokey in here...

00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,500
[MIKURIYA] What are you talking
about, you're smoking, too.

26
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,666
Anyway... Why don't
you help me move her?

Not gonna happen.

[MIKURIYA]
Oh, that's nice.

29
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,125
What kind of an
attitude is that from

30
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,250
a guy who wants a favor?

31
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,291
[RYUTA] Just shut
up and do your job.

32
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,750
[MIKURIYA]
Yeah, yeah...

33
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,791
This one brings
the total to five, huh?

34
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,458
[RYUTA] That we were
able to find, at least.

35
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,125
Anyhow, every last
drop of water's been

36
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,791
sucked from her body.

37
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,750
[RYUTA]
Desiccated.

38
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,583
[MIKURIYA]
That's right.

39
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,875
Kind of a shame, still...

40
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,625
I mean, she was just
a high schooler, you know?

41
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,791
Seems like a waste...

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,625

What's the matter?

00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,666
Don't you wanna
eat any of this?

So, over here
it's, like, all about you!

57
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,125
Putting that aside
for now, in this instance...

58
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:01,041
It depends on the indirect
object that follows and then--

59
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:01,916
you!

00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,333

Hey.

71
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,416
What about a little
coffee break huh?

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,291
I prefer strawberry milk.

73
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,333
Oh, great.

I got a little fever.

I'm going home early.

78
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,875
[TATSUMA] Yeah,
I got a stomach ache.

79
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,333
You two listen to me...

80
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,958
Hey! Get back here!

00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,458
That boring class
was putting me to sleep.

84
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,000
But I'm awake now.

85
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,000
How dare you?!

[drawers rattling]

96
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,208
Just as I thought...

97
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,583
It's too weak a link.

98
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:14,375
I can only assume I'm
overlooking some element.

99
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,625
[WANG]
How?

100
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,583
[YANG] More than
20 in two months.

101
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,500
The other gangs can't
figure it out either...

[FAN]
I don't know, man,

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,416
it couldn't possibly be
normal people doin' this stuff.

104
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,583
[YANG] It's not entirely
certain that they're people...

105
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,333
We oughta check with the
boss on this one before

106
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,750
we make any moves.

107
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,333
Huh?

108
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,458
[YANG] Have you two ever
heard of the "living dead"?

109
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,166
What do
you mean all of them?

110
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,041
[MIKURIYA ON PHONE]
I'm not kidding here!

111
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,125
I didn't even finish
my autopsy on that new girl,

112
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,333
before she runs off on me!

113
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,875
I mean, that's gotta
be against the rules!

114
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,083
Hey, you didn't know this
was going to happen, did you?

115
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,333
[RYUTA]
Shut up and do your job.

116
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,750
But all
the bodies are gone...

117
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,416
I'm gonna use this thing to
shove it right up your ass!

118
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,625
[FOUR GREAT] All right,
dickhead, let's play ball!

119
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,166
I guess
I've got no choice...

[light chuckle]

121
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,416
Hmm?

122
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,833
[FOUR GREAT]
Horaji...

123
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,125
You always make me look stupid
when we fight but this time,

124
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,666
I swear to God, it's not
gonna work! I'll kill y--

125
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,916
[crying in pain]

126
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,125
What the
heck are you doing?!

127
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,875
Is this a geology experiment?

128
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,166
If you must know, I was
on the trail of a scoop.

129
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,083
Whatever you're doing.

130
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,708
You have enthusiasm.

131
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,416
The mysterious transfer
student, Tatsuma Hiyu, hooks up

132
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,833
with resident delinquent Kyoichi
Horaiji and the two proceed to

133
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,625
cut class, get into brawls both
on and off campus, buy junk food

134
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,750
to eat on the way home,
and all of this adds up to a

135
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,291
record 26 offenses
in the past two months.

136
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,833
So you you think I'm
"mysterious", huh?

137
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,416
[KYOICHI]
Anko!

138
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,458
Holy shit, you're one persistent
little pest! I dunno if you call

139
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,875
it journalism or what, but in my
book I'd call what you're doing

140
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,916
just plain old-fashioned
spying, ya friggin' stalker!

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,125
You're like the pa- pa-

142
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,166
Paparazzi?

143
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,333
Yeah, that's right,
that's the word.

144
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,250
[KYOICHI]
Parapazzi!

145
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,125
It's "paparazzi."

146
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,583
I don't consider that an insult.

147
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,375
But why don't I cut to the
chase and ask what I've been

148
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,208
curious about: what have you
guys been up to at night lately?

149
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,208
I saw you with student
council president Aoi Misato,

150
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,541
the captain of the archery team,
Komaki Sakurai, and the captain

151
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,875
of the wrestling team,
Yuuya Daigo. That's kind of an

152
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,791
odd social circle,
don't you think? I mean,

153
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,375
I've never even seen you guys
talk to each other at school...

154
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,875
I smell a rat!

155
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,000
Listen here, little snitch!
I'd rather die than team up

156
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,958
with a bunch of candy-asses!

157
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,458
[TONO] Oh, would you now?
Man, do I ever smell a scoop!

158
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,750
[KYOICHI] I can't listen to
any more of this crap.

159
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,500
Tatsuma, let's get out of here!

160
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,041

[TATSUMA]
The living dead?

163
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,666
[KYOICHI] I'm telling you,
old man Yang used to know a

164
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,083
thing or two about Taoism.

165
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,416
You're kidding, right?

166
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,250
He happens to be the
leader of the notorious

167
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,708
"Three Wise Men"
of east Shinjuku.

168
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,041
It's always the quiet ones...

169
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,375
Well, it's a
complicated story...

170
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,708
...but now he's supposedly a
fine, upstanding citizen.

171
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,875
[KYOICHI] At least,
that's the story I heard.

172
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,250
And I've got a hunch he may
have a couple of ideas about why

173
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,291
we haven't been
getting any sleep lately.

174
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,083

00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,041
[gunfire]

178
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,208
[FAN]
Oh, shit.

179
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,750
[fight noises]

180
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,041
[YANG]
Fuku Ju Ko Mu Ryo!

181
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,500
Damn it! I ain't gonna lose!

182
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,583
[YANG] Rin Pyo To Sha
Kai Jin Retsu Zen!

183
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,458
KO!

184
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,625
Wha--

185
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,833
Let's check it out.

186
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,916
[YANG]
Fan! Wang!

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,125
[ground breaking]

188
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,333
[shocked gasp]

189
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:48,000
It can't be! Is that you, Boss?

190
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,333
[zombies roaring]

191
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,500
It was that girl...

192
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,375
Yang! Wang! Fan!

193
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,666
[TATSUMA]
That was the girl.

194
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,041
[KYOICHI] You mean the
girl who washed up here?

195
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,458
Yeah.

196
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,041
[KYOICHI] Old man Yang said
he'd give us the rest of

197
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,125
the story when we
caught up with him.

198
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,541
[KISARAGI]
The living dead...

199
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,625
There is a certain kind
of evil spirit known as

200
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:40,666
a Fuishimon, which kills
its former friends and family.

201
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,708
If the giant creature you
saw is controlling them,

202
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,125
it may be a kind of Moryo devil.

203
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,791
[TATSUMA]
Mor-yo, huh?

204
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,000
[KISARAGI] They're spirits that
live in nature, it's said that

205
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,791
Moryo are devils
that prey upon corpses.

206
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,125
[YUUYA] So they just
ended up as zombie chow.

207
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:59,166
Those guys Kyoichi knew and
that girl from Houmei High.

208
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,916
What the hell are you saying?
Is that why we've been at this

209
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,958
hunt for two weeks and we're
still ending up nowhere? Huh?

210
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,458
[AOI]
Komaki.

211
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,708
[KISARAGI] That's because
we've been unable to determine

212
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,291
a common link among the victims.

213
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,625
[KYOICHI]
Jeez.

214
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,583
Old man Yang was way
more helpful than you are...

215
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,666
[KISARAGI] Don't compare me
to that renegade Taoist hermit!

216
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,750
What was that?!

217
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,041
[KISARAGI] Were you
not the one who said

218
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,125
it doesn't matter
who this thing kills?

219
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,791
[KYOICHI]
You lookin' for a fight?

220
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,375
[KISARAGI] You are
such a simpleton...

221
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,708
[YUUYA] Cut it out you two,
give it a rest.

222
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,208
The point is: anyone
that devil has taken is

223
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,708
coming back to life
and killing more people.

224
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,375
So that's what we're up against.

225
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,875
[YUUYA]
Right, Kisaragi?

226
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,916
That's the jist of it.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,500
Maybe we should
concentrate on our similarities.

228
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,041
[AOI] We all want to protect the
city, no matter what it takes.

229
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,083
Thanks, Miss Student Council.

230
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,708
Was that a campaign speech?

231
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,666
Shut your trap!

232
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,916
[KYOICHI]
See, the thing is...

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,875
anybody can
make a pretty speech.

234
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,208
What are you gonna
be doing while we're

235
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,250
out there, busting
our asses fighting?

236
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,208
What other skills
do you have? Face it,

237
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,708
this just isn't where
you belong, princess.

238
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,541
You've only got the right to
talk all important-like after

239
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,833
you've actually
done some real work.

240
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,708
[KISARAGI]
Shut your insolent mouth!

241
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,333
How dare you speak
to her that way!

242
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,791
Don't worry about it, Hisui.

243
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,000
But he --

244
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,083
[AOI] It's all right.
Please. Continue.

245
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:13,833
[KISARAGI]
Right.

246
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,166
Here take a look at this. 

247
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,041
I compiled a list of
everyone reported missing

248
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,833
and anyone who'd been on
intimate terms with the victims.

249
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:23,875
[KOMAKI]
Oh my God...

250
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,000
[AOI]
There are so many of them...

251
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,708
[KISARAGI] The next victim will
probably be from Homei High.

252
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,625
[KOMAKI] Yeah,
that'd be a pretty safe bet,

253
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,750
but we don't have any idea
who that person might be.

254
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,333
Right?

255
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,458
Yeah! You've hit the nail right
on the head again, Sa-ku-rah-ee!

256
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,583
Wait a sec.

257
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,041
[KYOICHI] You think maybe she'd
know? She knows a lot more

258
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,708
than she needs to.

259
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,666
[YUUYA]
By "she" do you mean...?

260
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:50,166
[TONO] Huh? From Homei High?
Oh, you're asking about

261
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,458
Kugayama! She was
one of the best violinists

262
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,958
in Tokyo, you know.

263
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,708
She was originally
from Hokkaido.

264
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,375
I heard she lived on campus.

265
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,208
And, I believe she has a
boyfriend named Kamiyogi.

266
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,833
As a matter of fact, I've
got her address memorized!

267
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,750
[TONO]
Say...

268
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,375
How come you wanna
know all that stuff, anyway?

269
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,791
Uh, you see...

270
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,250
Academic curiosity.

271
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,666
[TONO]
What?

272
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,583
[TATSUMA] What I mean is
someone asked me to find out.

273
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,125
[TONO]
Oh? And who was that?

274
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,166
[TATSUMA]
Um, well...

275
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:17,833
Gotta go!

276
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,500
[TONO]
Uh, wait!

277
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,208
There's the mysterious
transfer student for you.

278
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,541
He's obviously
got something to hide.

279
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,666
Could this be a
scoop that I'm smelling?

280
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,958
[YUUYA] Split up? What are
you talking about, Kyoichi?

281
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,750
[KOMAKI] Remember the
terms of our agreement?

282
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,958
All five of us go.

283
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,500
[KYOICHI]
God, you pansies...

284
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,208
I don't need somebody to hold
my hand. And I never agreed

285
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,750
to those stupid "terms"
in the first place!

286
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,958
[AOI]
But...

287
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,250
[KYOICHI] Thanks to
our pasty-freak friend

288
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,833
I haven't had much
sleep the past two weeks.

289
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,791
Tatsuma and I are
gonna do our own thing.

290
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,250
[YUUYA] Well, I can't say I
don't understand how you feel...

291
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,333
What gives you the
right to be so selfish?

292
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,541
[KYOICHI] Oh,
shut yer face, she-male.

293
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,958
What did you call me?!

294
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,125
[KYOICHI] Anyhow if we
don't get our acts together and

295
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,250
settle this thing,
no one's ever gonna

296
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,166
be able to rest in peace again.

297
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,916
[INUGAMI] Horaiji! I haven't
received your report yet.

298
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,291
Inugami.

299
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,083
[INUGAMI] What you do at night
is your business but

300
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,958
I don't particularly wanna have
you in my class again next year.

301
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,333
[INUGAMI]
And I almost forgot...

302
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,416
Hiyu: it hasn't been too
safe around here lately.

303
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
I wouldn't go looking
for trouble if I were you.

304
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,916
[TATSUMA]
Yes, sir.

305
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,000

Kamiyogi...

00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,625
Kamiyogi...

311
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,083
Huh?

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,125
[YUKO]
Come on.

313
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,125
Come to me, Kamiyogi.

314
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,916
Is that you?

315
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,791
[KAMIYOGI] What are you
doing here? You know...

316
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,166
everybody's looking for you.

317
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,958
I mean, they told...

318
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,333
they told...

319
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,875
they told me that you're dead.

320
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,125

327
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,166

Now I get it...

[glass shatters]

He's getting away! Let's go!

00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,541
[YUUYA]
Uh, right!

336
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,583
Wha-what on earth was that
thing supposed to be anyw--

337
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,041
I hope that you can
forgive me for this, Kyoko.

338

[lightening bolt strikes]

339
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,458
That thing can jump.

340
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,291
Now we bring it down.

341
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,666
Hmm.

342
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,416

That one?

345
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,750
You gotta be
joking, she's only a kid.

00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,875
[KYOICHI]
Seems more like it's luring us

350
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,125
to its den than
running away from us.

351
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,375
[TATSUMA]
Let's go.

352
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,583
[distant zombie groan]

353
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,375
[zombies growling]

354
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,916
[KYOICHI]
It's time...

355
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,541
time to follow the light.

356
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:13,625
[MONKS] No-ro-I-to-ku,
I-to-mo-re-to-ru...

A-ri-shi-fu-we,

360
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,125
Tsu-mi-hi-to-no,
No-ro-I-to-ku!

361
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,458
[OLD MAN IN GLASSES]
He turned our spell on us!

362
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,750
[OLD MAN IN HAT]
Now what?

363
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,916
[OLD MAN IN GLASSES]
Try again!

364
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,291
No-ro-I-to-ku,
I-to-mo-re-to-ru

365
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,208
Shi-ka-ku-shi-ma,
A-ri-shi-fu-we...

366
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,000
Sha-ku-ko, Sha-ko,

367
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,750
Kin-ka-tsu, Kin-shin!

368
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,458
[MONK]
You soulless little monster!

369
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,333

[groans]

373
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,000
[TENDO]
And now for you...

374
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,791
Now that I've got your
attention and since all

375
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,541
of your friends are
gone, there's something

376
00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:00,083
I wanted to ask
you, Mister Eyebrows.

377
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,166
[screams]

378
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,750
[KYOICHI]
There are so many of them!

379
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,541
[TATSUMA]
Kyoichi, look out!

380
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,875
[KYOICHI] Tatsuma!
Now, quick, go for it's arms!

381
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,916
[pained groan]

382
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,583

Goddamn renegade!

[flames roar]

384
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
[gurgling]

385
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,583
The Ku-ja-ku-shi...

386
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,125
what a pain...

387
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,291
[OLD MEN] No-ro-I-to-ku,
I-to-mo-re-to-ru

388
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,625
They asked for it.

389
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,416
Do your thing, Claire.

390
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,750
[straining]

391
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,250
[explosion]

392
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,208
[YUUYA]
Kyoichi! Hiyu!

393
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,791
[cars honking]

394
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,583
Didn't mean to blow it up.

395
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,250
What a friggin' mess this is.

396
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,291
[KYOICHI] Hey, where you
think you're going, asshole?

397
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:46,875
[bursting]

398
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,625

399
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,375
[TATSUMA]
You alright?

400
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:05,583
[YUUYA]
Hey! Kyoichi! Hiyu!

401
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,500
[AOI]
There were so many of them.

402
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,208
[Kyoichi]
It's like I said before.

403
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,541
This isn't where
you belong, princess.

404
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:26,958
[AOI] I wasn't able to protect
them...I couldn't protect them.

405
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,666
[Newscaster] I repeat:
according to police,

406
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,458
the corpses discovered in the
cave-in account for almost all

407
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:34,958
of the missing persons.

408
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,500
[Newscaster] ...the number of
recovered bodies alone are

409
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,041
thought to number more than a
hundred. Seeking to at least

410
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,458
confirm identities, the
relatives of those missing are

411
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,541
asked to be patient as the
bodies are being identified...

412
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:44,875
Huh.

413
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,958
Wh-What in the...

414
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,458
What in the world is going on?!

00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,791
[AOI]
Tatsuma...?

3
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,708
Why you little...

4
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,000
Where on earth did they go?

5
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,333
Could that be...

6
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,166
[electric guitar shredding]

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,583
[RAITO]
That guitar...

8
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,708
[KYOICHI] Hey, man where
do you think you're goin'?

9
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,500
[KYOICHI]
Dammit!

10
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:17,791
Kyouichi.

11
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:18,791
[KYOICHI]
Let's get after him.

12
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:19,833
Right.

13
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,333
Tatsuma...

14
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,333
[TATSUMA] Make sure you guys
get in touch with Kisaragi.

15
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,958
[KYOICHI] They got
their asses kicked pretty bad

16
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,041
by Lightning Head.

17
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,125
Do what you can to fix them.

18
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,458
[AOI]
Right.

19
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,958
[electric guitar shredding]

20
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,333
Ryoichi...

21
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,625
If it isn't my enemy...

22
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,541
[RAITO] Ryoichi! It's me!
Don't you recognize me?

23
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,833
[KYOICHI]
Hold it right there!

24
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,333
You two again.

25
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,291
What's up, Lightening Boy?
Who's your little guitar friend?

26
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,958
[RAITO] This doesn't
concern you. So get lost.

27
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,291
[RYOICHI] It doesn't matter
how many of you stupid pigs

28
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,625
come at me. I'll
slaughter you all.

29
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,791
[KYOICHI] Little punk,
what did you just call us?!

30
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,916
I believe that I compared
the three of you to pigs.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,375
[electric guitar shredding]

32
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,625
[RYOICHI] Sound is so incredibly
powerful that it can interfere

33
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:43,416
with just about anything
by using vibration alone.

34
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,916
And at my slightest command...

35
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,583
[KYOICHI]
Hey, Tatsuma, you stupid pig!

36
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,958
Don't just stand there with
your thumb up your--

37
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,458
don't look at me like
that, punk!

38
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,208
What the hell you
gawking at, moron?

39
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,125
[TATSUMA]
Kyoichi's a stupid idiot!

40
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,666
Kyoichi's a stupid idiot!

41
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,583
Kyouichi's a piece of
trash! He's trash!

42
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,625
[battle cry]

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,250
Kyoichi!

44
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,750
Oh, man...
What the hell was that?

45
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,750
It seems you
too have the Power.

46
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,500
[RYOICHI]
It's magnificent, isn't it?

47
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:21,333
All things obey me and whatever
I ask for I can have.

48
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,416
Because I have become as
powerful as a god.

49
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,958
Ryouichi, did... did you...

50
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,666
[Ryoichi chuckles]

51
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,750
[RYOICHI]
The pigs wish to defy a god?

52
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,375
What the hell
are you doing?

53
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,875
[Kyoichi chocking]

54
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,500
It's not me,
he's controlling my body!

55
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,666
Stop it, man. Leave them alone.

56
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,750
[electric guitar shredding]

57
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,125
This isn't your sound.

58
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,708
This isn't how you're
supposed to play!

59
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,583
Your sound? No...
it was our sound.

60
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,083
It should never have
been like this.

61
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,625
[RYOICHI]
Raito.

62
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,833
[plays chord]

63
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,000
Ryoichi, no!

64
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,666
[TATSUMA]
What the hell just happened?!

65
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,291
You two need to get lost.

66
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,875
[KYOICHI]
What was all that?

67
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,333
Hey! Where do you
think you're goin'?

68
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,583
Damnit... Stupid
lightning bastard...

69
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,541
[ANKO] Ohran Academy, Class
3-4, Hisui Kisaragi:

70
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,416
President of the school's
Tea Ceremony Club,

71
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,375
proprietor of an antiques shop,
and well known hunk.

72
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,166
So how do you two
know each other, huh?

73
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,416
Lady Misato, I have
told you time and time again

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,458
that you must never go
act on your own.

75
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:02,250
I'm so sorry, Hisui but I
was just wanted to help out.

76
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,083
Hey, don't you ignore me!

77
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,083
[YUUYA] So the flock of crows
that attacked those people is

78
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,250
being controlled by the guy
with the guitar.

79
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,333
Isn't that right, Horaiji?

80
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,041
[KYOICHI] Yeah...
And he could control

81
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,250
our voices and our
bodies at will, too.

82
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,291
He had the power to control
atmospheric vibrations?

83
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,541
Kyoichi said some
very nasty things to me.

84
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,458
I'm tellin' you,
that wasn't me talkin'!

85
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,958
And then he
tried to strangle me.

86
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,208
Stop tryin' to make
me look bad! Oh, come on,

87
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:29,916
you did the same
thing to me. Oh, screw it...

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,083
So that guy with the crazy
hair is supposed to know

89
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,708
the guitar player,
is that right?

90
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,083
[ANKO] That's right! They're
from that band, Crow! You know.

91
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,166
I don't wanna be rude,

92
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,791
but nobody invited you
to this party.

93
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,625
Whatta you want, parasite?

94
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,125
[TATSUMA] Not as much
of a parasite as you are.

95
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,000
[KYOICHI] I told you,
it wasn't me!

96
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,791
[YUUYA]
So, what is this "Crow" thing?

97
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,958
[ANKO] They were this
crazy popular indie band.

98
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,458
They only released, like, 11
songs over two years, but every

99
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,416
one of them was a hit. They were
this huge internet sensation.

100
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,041
Oh, and all of the members
are Tokyo high schoolers,

101
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,083
just like us. So
that's pretty cool, huh?

102
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,583
[KOMAKI] Really? So who's
the guy with the mohawk?

103
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,416
That's Raito, the lead
singer. Ryoichi was the one who

104
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,250
was the driving force behind
the band. He played guitar and

105
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,833
composed all of their songs.

106
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,541
He was a huge
deal on the music scene,

107
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,875
but then...

108
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,291
[KOMAKI]
What?

109
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,000
[ANKO] Three months ago,
the band mysteriously broke up.

110
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,583
Word on the street was that
Ryoichi just disappeared.

111
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,083
[KOMAKI]
But why?

112
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,541
[ANKO] I dunno. From what I hear
the rumor has it he was a

113
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,583
real difficult person to get
along with, so the band was

114
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,541
always arguing and getting
into fights with each other.

115
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,166
They broke
up three months ago...

116
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,250
It was just about then, huh?

117
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,291
[AOI]
Yes...

118
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,875
[YUUYA] So there are other
people out there like us.

119
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,291
[KOMAKI] Which means
we're gonna have to fight

120
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,250
other people
with the Power.

121
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,791
[crying]

122
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,625
[TENDO] What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

123
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,875
[RYOICHI] I don't think I can
do this... I can't do this!

124
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,333
You can. You'll
find the strength because

125
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,916
this is what he wants.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,291
[RYOICHI]
But...

127
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,791
[TENDO] You know that you're
the only person who can

128
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,416
grant that wish.

129
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,791
That's why he's
chasing you so mercilessly.

130
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,166
Surely you haven't forgotten?

131
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,750
[RYOICHI] Raito? He wants this?
Of course he does...

132
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,166
[KYOICHI] Well, that settles
it then. I'd sure love to teach

133
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,916
Lightning Head a lesson, but
I guess we're gonna have to go

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,041
after the little Crow Boy first.

135
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,750
[ANKO] For crying out loud!
What the heck is going on with

136
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,291
you guys, anyway?!
Somebody better start explaining

137
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,375
things to me right now
or I'm gonna get really angry!

138
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,875
Hey, Dungeonmaster.

139
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,875
[KISARAGI]
What?

140
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,125
You got any baskets?

141
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,166
Huh?

142
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,333
I've got a pot, will that do?

143
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,750
[ANKO]
Huh?

144
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,375
[AOI] I wonder if it was wrong
of us to do that to Tono...

145
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,208
[KYOICHI] It'll be fine.
With everything we're up against

146
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:03,166
we couldn't protect
her even if we wanted to.

147
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,125
[KYOICHI]
Don't you agree... Misato?

148
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,791
Well, I guess you must be right.

149
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:21,000
[electric guitar shredding]

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,666
Ryoichi!
It's me Raito.

151
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,333
Tell me what the
hell's gotten into you?!

152
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,291
[RAITO] You were always alone...
even when you were a little kid.

153
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,125
You didn't even try to make
any friends, except for me.

154
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,333
I guess both of us coming
from broken homes,

155
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,500
it was easy to become
like brothers.

156
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,250
I always think about how proud
I was of your guitar-playing.

157
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,958
Remember how much you loved
playing and that's why we

158
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,750
started the band. And I thought
the band would help you to

159
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,875
make friends.

160
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,583
[RYOICHI]
You wanna change it? Why?

161
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,250
[RAITO] Because if
we don't rearrange it,

162
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,500
then the other guys won't be
able to keep up with us.

163
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
[RYOICHI] Raito.
You promised me that we'd

164
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,833
never change this song.
You remember that?

165
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,833
[RAITO] They can't play it live.
And we've got a gig, so...

166
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,083
Ryoichi?

167
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,041
[RAITO] You just
disappeared which meant

168
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,625
that was the end of Crow.

169
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:32,333
I formed the band for
you... to help you.

170
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,416
[RAITO]
Where in the hell have you been?

171
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,250
[RYOICHI] Let go of me!
Get your hands off of me!

172
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,666
[RAITO] You're comin' back
with me, you got that?

173
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,166
[RYOICHI]
Like hell!

174
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,375
Everyone's waiting on you,
damnit! You're comin' with me!

175
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,958
Understand!--

176
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,750
[RAITO] Ever since that day,
I've been able to use the Power.

177
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,541
And since you disappeared,
I've been searching for you,

178
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:01,375
wondering if... maybe
you'd got this power, too.

179
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,208
[RYOICHI] You know I've
been waiting for you to come.

180
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,166
I've been waiting for you all
this time. I wanted them to hear

181
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,208
the music we made.
That you and I created.

182
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,500
I'll use this divine power
to make those ignorant

183
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,708
pigs understand!

184
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,541
Do you know this Power
doesn't make you into a god?

185
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,958
In fact you're acting
more like the Grim Reaper.

186
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:27,875
[Ryoichi laughs]

187
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,666
[RYOICHI] You can't fight
the music made by a god!

188
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,166
But you know that.
Don't you, Raito?

189
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,250
Ryouichi, you...
You've already killed--

190
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,791
[KYOCHI] Well, well,
lookie what we found here:

191
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:44,083
Lightning Head. And his "little
sidekick", The Crow Boy.

192
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,666
[RAITO] This isn't
any of your business.

193
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,458
So get the hell out of here!

194
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,375
[KYOICHI]
Put a sock in it, Bedhead!

195
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,208
This isn't just
your problem or ours.

196
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,500
It's the whole city's.
Don't be so full of yourself

197
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,875
to think you can fix
all this on your own.

198
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,416
[RAITO]
You don't understand...

199
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,958
[RYOICHI] Then it's settled.
I'll let everybody hear it.

200
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:08,708
The true voice of God...
that we created...

201
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:18,541
[ANKO]
I want my scoop!

202
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,291
[explosion]

203
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,708
[electric guitar shredding]

204
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,083
[TATSUMA]
Kyoichi! Behind you!

205
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,083
Horaiji!

206
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,500
[KYOICHI]
Hey, Dumb Muscle-head!

207
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,250
What did you say?!

208
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,041
[FIREFIGHTER]
Oh my God...

209
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,875
[RAITO] What are you doing?
You need to fight me!

210
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,666
I'm the one who attacked
you remember? Ryoichi!

211
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,708
Hey, I got a question: how can
we be sure that mohawk guy

212
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,791
isn't still our enemy?

213
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,583
[AOI]
I'm not sure.

214
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,916
He's not after us.
He wasn't fighting us at his

215
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,500
full strength earlier.

216
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,083
Sure 'bout that?

217
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,125
All of his strikes deliberately
missed all of our vital spots.

218
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,875
So that means...

219
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,791
You did it so you could
determine whether we were your

220
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:13,041
enemies or on your side.
Your eyes tell me...

221
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,541
that you're not a killer.

222
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:25,708
[YUUYA] Are we really
gonna fight another human being?

223
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,166
[KYOICHI]
Looks like it...

224
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,750
Nope. It's no good.
There's just not enough

225
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,125
evidence to go on.

226
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,583
Have you looked at
anyone the crows attacked?

227
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, I didn't find anything.

228
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:47,000
That's too bad. Well,
I guess that's what we expected.

229
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,791
[RAITO] You just
don't know when to quit.

230
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,666
I already told you:
I'll take care of Ryoichi.

231
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,250
[KYOICHI] Hey, you're the
one who got us involved

232
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,208
in this in the first place.

233
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,958
Weren't you lookin'
for a jamboree?

234
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,666
You mean, Jam session.

235
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,083
[KYOICHI]
Stop correcting me!

236
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,000
Who the hell
are you guys, anyway?

237
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,666
[TATSUMA] We're here to protect
the city and everyone in it.

238
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,125
And to protect them, we fight.

239
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,208
[KYOICHI]
Let's do this!

240
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,291
[RAITO] Ryoichi...
I wish we can go back

241
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,375
to the way things used to be.

242
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,916
But we can't turn back.

243
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,375
And someone has to stop you.

244
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,750
So I will!

245
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,916
[battle cry]

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,875
[screams]

247
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,375
[TENDO]
Hmmm...

248
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,458
[KYOICHI] Were you
really trying to kill him?

249
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,625
You can't go
through with it, can you?

250
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,291
[RAITO] I couldn't do it.
I just couldn't.

251
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,500
[AOI] There is no need to take
another person's life.

252
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,708
We don't know what happened
between the two of you.

253
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,458
But no matter how terrible the
crimes he's committed, we...

254
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,666
we have to try to
save his soul, and to do that,

255
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,875
we have to give
him another chance.

256
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,875
Please we must let him live!

257
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,291
Save his soul.
Didn't think of that...

258
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,500
[RYOICHI]
What happened...

259
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,250
You're the one
who took them from me.

260
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,791
It was you!

261
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,833
It was you!

262
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,541
Ryoichi?

263
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,583
[RYOICHI] You know Raito.
You did it to us.

264
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,125
You ruined us!!!!

265
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,708
[RAITO]
Ryoichi!

266
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,291
Ryoichi!

267
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,250
[shrieks]

268
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,416
[people chatter]

269
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,083
[explosion]

270
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,541
[battle cry]

271
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,750
[multiple explosions]

272
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,666
[people chattering]

273
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,833
[KISARAGI]
Three million yen...

274
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,625
[ANKO] Huh? So you're telling me
that you're one of

275
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,333
the members of Kyoichi's gang?

276
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,291
Yeah, that's right.
The Boss is the one that has

277
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,000
shown us the right
path to follow.

278
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,541
[ANKO] Well, you
sure are a lifesaver!

279
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,166
[AZUMABASHI] Hey, I'd do
anything for one of the boss's

280
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,250
school friends!
Know what I'm sayin'?

281
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,791
Tatsuma! Damn it!

282
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,500

[explosion]

287
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,833
[AZUMABASHI]
What the hell's goin' on?!

288
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,333
[ANKO] Thanks for the ride. I'll
be okay on my own from here.

289
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,041
[AZUMABASHI]
You can't be serious! You know,

290
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,875
I uh think we oughta go back...

291
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,333
Lemme tell you a little
somethin' about journalists:

292
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,291
whoever gets the story wins!

293
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,583
[RAITO]
Ryoichi!

294
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,750
[KYOICHI]
Demonic Crow!

295
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,291
[RAITO] You were saying that I
ruined us? Well, what the hell

296
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,750
would you call what you're
doing now, huh? What's with this

297
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,500
"sound of a god" shit?!
Where's the sound we made?!

298
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,958
[RAITO] Were we just writing
songs to become mass murderers?

299
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,875
What the hell did you write 'em
for, anyway? Who did you write

300
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:51,541
'em for, Ryoichi?! Hey, are
you gonna answer me or not?!

301
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:57,250
[growls]

302
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,208
Ryoichi...

303
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,208
[KYOICHI] Tatsuma,
what the hell are you doing?

304
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,791
I feel sorry for her.
But we both know that for her

305
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,583
it's too late.

306
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,625
All we can do now
is try to stop him.

307
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,458
[TATSUMA] I can't
just leave her here.

308
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,875
I can't just leave her here!

309
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:37,250
[KYOICHI] Okay, then.
We'll go take care of Crow Boy.

310
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,458
[TATSUMA]
Thanks.

311
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,416
[animalistic wheezing]

312
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,750
[RYOICHI]
Raito?

313
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,916
Ryoichi, I'm here.

314
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,666
What's goin' on?

315
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,166
[shrieks]

316
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,666
What was that?

317
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,250
[growls]

318
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:23,000
[RAITO]
Ryoichi? Ryoichi?

319
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,375
[RYOICHI]
Raito...

320
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,750
[RAITO]
Stay with me.

321
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,291
What's going on?

322
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,333
Ya got me, man.

323
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,791
[YUUYA]
Is he... back to normal?

324
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,000
[RAITO]
Ryoichi...

325
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,541
[RYOICHI] Why did you change it?
We made that song together...

326
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:59,000
It was ours and
no one else's... Raito...

327
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,041
I thought at least
you would understand!

328
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:08,208
That was it? You were still
upset with me about that song?

329
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,916
I just wanted to protect it,
no matter what.

330
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,000
[AOI] Can you
tell me something?

331
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,458
Why did you do it?
How were you able to turn

332
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,666
yourself into a demon?

333
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,708
[RYOICHI] It was...
the Dark Arts...

334
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,583
[RAITO]
Oh!

335
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,416
[KOMAKI]
Oh my god.

336
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,458
[CLAIRE]
Oh, phooey.

337
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,666
[TENDO] We grant a favor and
give him the Power, but it looks

338
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,583
as if there was a trace of
humanity left in him and

339
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,750
the demon's power devoured
what was left of his soul.

340
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,000
[CLAIRE]
That's totally gross.

341
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,916
Who the hell are you?!

342
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,750
Well, we must be off.

343
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,500
We'll see
each other again soon.

344
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,500
Aw, that was boring.

345
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,583
[RAITO]
Ryoichi! Ryoichi!

[KYOICHI] Yeah, I know,
it looks a little shady

but in my humble
opinion--dirtier the bowl,

I guess she can't be a
son-of-a-bitch if she's a girl.

do for you, madame president?

Ms. Alucard wanted me to make
sure to show him around campus.

134
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,333
I also wanted to
check if everything's okay.

happening around here lately

to tell you to be very careful.

Terrible things?

Yes.

Some students
have gone missing, and...

150
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,666
and there have been
a couple of murders.

151
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,375
You can see the
number of victims going up

152
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,958
and up every
time you watch the news.

two or three new deaths...

if they can buy a solution
to this problem, princess.

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,708
At the end of the day,
it's all the same.

00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,750
There's no noticeable
difference between people

164

and animals, anyhow.

00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,000
There's nothing remotely
"unusual" about any of this.

They kill, devour, rape...

Shut the hell up.

anything that a little princess

it has been reported that

179
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,416
a priceless work of art

180
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,750
was carried off in the
aftermath of an explosion that

181
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,375
occurred yesterday morning on
the Tokyo-Nagoya Expressway.

182
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,833
It is believed the work in
question is one of a collection

183
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,000
that are known as the
"ten sacred treasures".

184
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,500
Some believe the
accident itself may have been

185
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,500
a smokescreen to facilitate
the theft of the item...

186
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,666
[clock tower strikes]

187
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,833
[giggles]

188
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,541
[KYOICHI] Damn!
Transfer Student

189
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,041
turns out to be a ladies' man.

190
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,708
Hey, you mind if I
take a look at your mail?

191
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,916
[KYOICHI]
Hmm?

192
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,125
[KYOICHI] Wha-What's up
with that? Crazy...

193
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,583
Anyway, you up for
some ramen? My treat.

194
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,958
[KISARAGI] The item the
master requested has arrived.

195
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,833
What would you like me
to do with it?

196
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,208
Miss Misato?

197
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:49,791
[AOI]
Oh.

198
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,208
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,750
I honestly don't know
what I'm gonna do with Daddy.

200
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,291
Always ordering
new things although

201
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,750
he hardly ever comes home...

202
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,125
What did he send us this time?

203
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,708
[keyboard clicking]

204
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,166
[YANG]
Hey there, boss!

205
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,000
Huh?

206
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,625
[KYOICHI] Well,
if it isn't Old Man Yang!

207
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,041
[YANG] I appreciated
your help the other day.

208
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,375
[KYOICHI] You're not makin'
trouble again, are you?

209
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,416
Aw, c'mon, can't ya
have a little faith in me?

210
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,833
[KYOICHI]
Well, see ya later.

211
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,041
[YANG]
Yeah, later.

212
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,708
Now, you take care, boss!

213
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,333
[FAN] I think we got it
cleaned up, master.

214
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,625
[YANG]
Right. Just keep at it.

215
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,166
[WANG] What do you think
the boss would do to us

216
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,291
if he saw what the inside of
this place looks like right now?

217
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,625
[YANG] He'd beat the
living daylights out of us.

218
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,583
And then our miserable
souls would wander around

219
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,250
in Limbo for eternity,

220
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,125
'cause there ain't no way they'd
let guys like us into heaven.

221
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,500
[WANG]
Man, that'd suck...

222
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,166
[FAN] All I want is
to just die in my sleep.

223
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,125
[Yang cackles]

224
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,083
[KYOICHI]
What's up?

225
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,666
Why, if it isn't Kyoach.

226
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,458
Don't call me that!

227
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,000
[COOK] Sit down
and order, would ya?

228
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,708
Tatsuma Hiyu.

229
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,000
What the hell are
you doin' here, meathead?

230
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,333
[AOI]
A showdown?

231
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,291
[KOMAKI VIA PHONE]
A guy from the Wrestling Club

232
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,541
was telling me that Daigo said

233
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,125
he was going to fight the
transfer student.

234
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,583
[AOI]
But, do you know where?

235
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,166
[KOMAKI VIA PHONE]
At the old school building.

236
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,750
Guys are so stupid, aren't they?

237
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,916
I mean, what's this gonna prove?
Hey, are you still there? Aoi?

238
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,541
[YUUYA] This old 
building's been around

239
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,666
since before the War. But
nobody's used it for years.

240
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,750
[KYOICHI] In other words:
no one's gonna bother us.

241
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,083
[YUUYA] Hey.
Who invited you along, anyway?

242
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,250
[KYOICHI] C'mon, you wrestling
guys like it when people watch.

243
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,833
I'll be the ref.

244
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,458
How come it's so
bright in here, anyway?

245
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,125
I told the Drama Club
I'd get them lunch

246
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,291
if I could use
their lights tonight.

247
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,916
[KYOICHI]
That's not what I was asking...

248
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,875
What the hell does it matter?!

249
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,375
[Kyoichi chuckling]

250
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,250
[KYOICHI] You've plastered
talismans all over the walls

251
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,750
like they're a bunch of
centerfolds, Daigo.

252
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,000
What, are you scared that
we're gonna see a ghost?

253
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:13,958
[YUUYA] We won't!
I say there'll be no ghosts!

254
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,458
No ghosts.

255
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,958
[YUUYA]
Now, let's go.

256
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,083

00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,375

'Fraid to fight me? Come on.

nosiest girl on the planet.

[AOI] I'm sorry,
but you can't do this.

271
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,458
You need a teacher's permission
to even be on this property.

272
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,208
[KYOICHI] What? That's what
you're worried about?

273
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,000
[AOI] At any rate,
we need to get out of here.

guys clean up, okay?

00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,041
It couldn't be.

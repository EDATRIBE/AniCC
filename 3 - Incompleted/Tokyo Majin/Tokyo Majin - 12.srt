1
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,333
The time for revenge
has arrived.

2
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,291
[engine noise]

3
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,875
[CLAIRE gasps]

4
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,416
[cat squeals]

5
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,833
[CLAIRE]
Hello, Lord Yagyu.

6
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,375
[YAGYU]
So, what's he up to?

7
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,916
[CLAIRE]
He has control of some girl

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,916
who's supposed to have the
Bodhisattva Eye or something.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,750
He's making some
kind of plan...

10
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,708
[YAGYU]
Let him do as he likes.

11
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:02,250
[CLAIRE]
Huh? Are you sure about that?

12
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,333
It'll be worth watching...

13
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:08,083
to see how the Vessel reacts...

14
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,208
It's quiet lately.

15
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,166
Sure is. Nothin' at all
going on around here.

16
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,666
But... no news is
good news, right?

17
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, well, it's
making me nervous.

18
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,541
[RYUTA] Huh?

19
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,166
[INUGAMI] Repeating the same
things all over again, huh?

20
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:11,333
Some people just don't learn;
that much seems obvious...

21
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,375
[AZUMABASHI] So do ya think
that guy is gonna be all right?

22
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,166
Yeah, Tatsuma's not gonna
bite the dust without a fight.

23
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,583
Thanks for your help tonight.

24
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,791
Yeah, well, don't be a stranger,
boss, call me anytime!

25
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,708
All right. See ya around!

26
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,583
So it looks
like you're back

27
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,000
with your batteries
fully charged.

28
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,791
That stunt you pulled
back there by the shrine

29
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,791
must've been
pretty impressive.

30
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,166
If that was any indication,
you and your buddies

31
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,166
seem to be better at
using your powers, too.

32
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,791
So tell me, what the hell
are you doing back here?

33
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,291
It's almost like
you're not grateful

34
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,625
that I saved your
asses out there.

35
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,958
Don't you worry. I got
no business with you.

36
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,708
I just figured that
if I followed you around

37
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,125
long enough I'd be
able to find him.

38
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,791
"Him" who?

39
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,541
[MAIKO]
Oh! Oh, Houraiji! Oh.

40
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,666
[KYOUICHI] Hey.

41
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,916
[MAIKO] Hello.

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,125
[KYOUICHI]
How's Tatsuma doing?

43
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,416
The Doctor's examining
him as we speak.

44
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,916
But it looks good. She says he's
not in any immediate danger.

45
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,083
[ANKO] Here.

46
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,291
How are you doing?

47
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,791
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

48
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,708
Shouldn't you be getting
home soon? It's kinda late.

49
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,500
I'm worried too,
so I'd like to stay.

50
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,458
Huh?

51
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:23,125
Heh. So what's
the story, old bag?

52
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:27,083
Call me that again and it's
the last thing you'll ever say.

53
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,708
Is he gonna be all right?

54
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,166
[IWAYAMA] I'm pretty
impressed, actually.

55
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,208
Any one of these injuries
would have been fatal

56
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,875
if he hadn't just barely
dodged each of them.

57
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,500
You know, you've
always been lacking

58
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,000
in the brains department,
but you sure do have a knack

59
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,750
for finding guys like this
to have as your friend...

60
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,833
Hmph.

61
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,791
Could it be some
primal instinct at work?

62
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,583
Shut it.

63
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,083
[YUKINO]
What a relief!

64
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,625
[HINANO] Yes.

65
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,833
So what's going on?
What were the two of you

66
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,833
doing there in
the first place?

67
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,333
I'm not sure how we
can answer that...

68
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,666
Uh... How can I put this...?

69
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,458
[RYUZAN] Perhaps you
could allow me to explain.

70
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,625
Master? What is this?

71
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,375
[KISARAGI] Old Man
White Moth... Master Ryuzan!

72
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,625
Huh?

73
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,541
Young Kisaragi. It has
been a very long time.

74
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,166
And Iwayama, you seem
as well as ever.

75
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,458
I don't need your flattery.

76
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,625
[RYUZAN chuckles]

77
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,666
Kisaragi... and Dr. Iwayama?

78
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,041
You mean you guys knew
each other all along?

79
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,500
Aw, just cut to the chase!

80
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,708
[KYOUICHI]
I really hate mysteries.

81
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,791
So, you gonna spit it out
or what... gramps?

82
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:54,541
[barks]

83
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:03,125
[RYUZAN] There is an individual
known as the "Bodhisattva Eye."

84
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,083
[ANKO]
Bodhisattva Eye?

85
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,041
[RYUZAN] This person has the
power to read the Dragon Stream

86
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,083
and thereby select the
chosen from all humanity

87
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,083
and lead them to salvation.

88
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,375
However, this person is
also a source of conflict

89
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:20,708
precisely because they may use
the power of the Dragon Stream.

90
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,416
If one could manipulate
the Dragon Stream at will,

91
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,541
then bringing the world
under your control

92
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,291
would be no great effort.

93
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,250
Since the beginning of time,
those in positions of power

94
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,416
have waged countless
battles over the use

95
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,125
of the Bodhisattva Eye.

96
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,916
If the past is any indicator,
it would be most irresponsible

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,125
and unwise not to prepare
ourselves for any eventuality.

98
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,791
[KOMAKI] So what
are you trying to say?

99
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,000
[RYUZA] It is said that the one
who holds the Bodhisattva Eye

100
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,125
also holds a certain
amount of power.

101
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,875
[YUUYA]
What kind of power?

102
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:57,041
[RYUZA] To rejuvenate the
power of life, so to speak.

103
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,291
The ultimate
power of healing.

104
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,666
[KOMAKI gasps]

105
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,583
It can't be!

106
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:09,041
Aoi... Aoi's the
Bodhisattva Eye?

107
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,500
[IWAYAMA] The healing powers
of the Bodhisattva Eye

108
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,833
are on an entirely
different level from my own.

109
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,083
Not only can
they heal injuries,

110
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,083
but they can even
restore the dead to life.

111
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,916
On the other hand, they can
instantly advance the age

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,625
of a person, older and older,
until that person dies.

113
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,875
[RYUZAN] The Eight-Hands-Breadth
Sword that they stole

114
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,250
is an instrument that
greatly intensifies

115
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,375
the Bodhisattva Eye's powers.
It is one of a collection

116
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,958
that together are called
the ten sacred treasures.

117
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,458
"The ten sacred treasures"?

118
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,708
[YUUYA] If it's only one
of ten, then that means...

119
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,125
[RYUYA] Our enemy has already
obtained the other nine.

120
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:53,333
On one occasion, we were able
to track him down. However...

121
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,833
[KYOUICHI] Huh. You were no
match for him, huh, gramps?

122
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,333
[YUUYA] Kyouichi!

123
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,583
[RYUZA] Heh. It's quite all
right. He speaks the truth.

124
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,833
The Bodhisattva Eye
only appears

125
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,291
when the Dragon Stream
has been disrupted.

126
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,125
[KOMAKI] So, wait a sec.

127
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,875
If Tendo Kozunu was causing
all those demon attacks

128
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,083
to disrupt the
Dragon Stream...

129
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,583
[gasps] Then...

130
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:17,583
[KYOUICHI] Right. He only
did it so he could wake up

131
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,083
the Bodhisattva Eye in Aoi.

132
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,458
[KOMAKI] Does Aoi know
what's happening to her?

133
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,416
[KYOUICHI] Good question.
Why don't you answer

134
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,541
that one for her,
Doom 'n Gloom? Asshole...

135
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,125
[KOMAKI]
What is this?

136
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:44,541
You told her...
You told Aoi, didn't you?

137
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
You idiot! If you told her
about something like that,

138
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:54,958
you know she would... Why?!
Why would you tell her?!

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,708
And that wasn't all
you did either, was it?

140
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,333
[KOMAKI] Tell the truth.

141
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,583
Tell me what the hell
you did to Aoi!

142
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,500
I tried to kill her.

143
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,041
[KOMAKI gasps]

144
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,083
[KISARAGI]
The Bodhisattva Eye...

145
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,958
The one with the power
of the Bodhisattva Eye

146
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,625
will bring doom
upon this world.

147
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,458
With that being the case,

148
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,583
I sought to kill her
before she...

149
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,458
[KOMAKI shudders]

150
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,833
[KOMAKI]
You son of a--!

151
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,500
[slap]
[KOMAKI grunts]

152
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,166
[KOMAKI grunts repeatedly]

153
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,750
[KOMAKI shudders]

154
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,791
[approaching footsteps]

155
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,333
[YUUYA]
Sakurai, no!

156
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,125
Stop it! Please stop fighting!

157
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,625
My God! How could you
even consider that?!

158
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,083
Why would anybody
have to kill Aoi?

159
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,916
It just doesn't make sense!

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,291
[KOMAKI]
It's not her fault she was

161
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,833
born with that stupid power.

162
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,041
It's not her fault that
those demons appeared!

163
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,791
Aoi always said that we should
try to protect people...

164
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,958
She said we should
do everything we could.

165
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,000
At first I wondered why she was
saying all that stuff to us...

166
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,541
Why she thought we could prevent
people from getting hurt...

167
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,250
All along, she still...

168
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,458
[KOMAKI] I'm wasting
my breath. Someone like you

169
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,083
could never be half as
courageous as Aoi is!

170
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,875
[KOMAKI cries]

171
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,416
[KYOUICHI] Komaki...

172
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,000
I think that's enough.

173
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,750
[RYUZAN] Kisaragi...

174
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,291
Those were your grandfather's
instructions, weren't they?

175
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,083
[KISARAGI] Yes.

176
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,958
Just like you, Kisaragi,
I and the Oribe sisters here

177
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,625
are the last in a long
line of ancestors

178
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:55,291
who have defended this land
of Edo, this city of Tokyo,

179
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,875
[RYUZAN] from evil forces
down through the ages.

180
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,958
We each have our own missions,
and it is the mission

181
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,416
of the Kisaragi to kill
the Bodhisattva Eye.

182
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
[KOMAKI]
But... what about Aoi?

183
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:13,250
[indistinct murmuring]

184
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,250
[TENDO]
That's a good girl.

185
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,541
[TENDO laughs]

186
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,375
You know, I love your eyes.

187
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,333
[CLAIRE] Hm. So you
can talk to girls

188
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,083
as long as it's
one of your toys.

189
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,625
For a puppet on someone
else's strings,

190
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,916
you've sure got a point
of view. Have you finished

191
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,750
running errands
for your master?

192
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,875
You're not fit to
breathe the same air!

193
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,125
[TENDO] You think so, hm?

194
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:46,916
Hmph. Well, no matter.
It's time to go, my dear Aoi.

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,041
Kisaragi, I will tell
you all the account

196
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,541
of how this strife began.

197
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,208
I'll tell you all.
Everything I know...

198
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:08,416
[child's voice]
Mother! M-Mother! M-Mother!

199
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,291
[RYUZAN] The house of
Kozunu launched a coup

200
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,041
against the ruling parties.
The reason was that

201
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,500
the shogunate attempted to
kidnap one of their daughters,

202
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,416
who had been born with the
power of the Bodhisattva Eye.

203
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,291
In order to protect the girl,
the Kozunu made use

204
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,291
of the Dark Arts
and used force

205
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,833
to rebel against the might
of the Shogunate.

206
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,250
[ANKO]
So that means...

207
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,083
[YUUYA] It means the
Shogunate are the ones

208
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,333
who started the whole thing.

209
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,958
[YUKINO]
And we're continuing...

210
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,250
[HINANO] Why did we never
know this before, Master Arai?

211
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,916
[KYOUICHI]
That's how war is.

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,583
There's no "good" fighting
or "bad" fighting.

213
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,666
Even that fight was
just a struggle for power

214
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,791
when you come down to it.

215
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,875
So, Kisaragi...

216
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,375
What's up? You still
gonna kill Aoi over this?

217
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,083
[RYUZAN] That fight
ended in a bloody defeat

218
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,166
for the Kozunu family.
Decades later,

219
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,583
their descendants
again raised an army

220
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,750
during the Bakumatsu reign,

221
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,458
but once again
they were defeated.

222
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,416
Since that time, the Kozunu
have hidden their lineage,

223
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,791
and lived in the shadows of
history, unbeknownst to anyone.

224
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,166
I don't know how
they managed to do it,

225
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,750
but they escaped
their pursuers,

226
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,958
and continued to
evade people like us

227
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,000
after the Meiji
Restoration as well.

228
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,666
All I know for certain

229
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,083
is that the man who calls
himself Tendo Kozunu

230
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,375
must have lived
quite a life indeed.

231
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,708
[MAN A] I don't believe
you're a Kozunu!

232
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,208
[WOMAN A]
You concealed your identity

233
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,375
so you could sneak
into our family!

234
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,041
[WOMAN B] And then you
gave birth to a child!

235
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,083
How utterly disgusting!

236
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,416
[door locks]

237
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,583
[CHILD] Mother!

238
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,000
This is for you, Mother.

239
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,875
[TATSUMA] I think I...
can kind of understand...

240
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,583
[KYOUICHI] Tatsuma!

241
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,583
[YUUYA] Hiyu!

242
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,166
[KOMAKI]
Hey, Tatsuma!

243
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,708
[ANKO]
Oh! Tatsuma!

244
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,791
You idiot. Goin' overboard,
don'tcha think?

245
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,250
Sorry.

246
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,041
[ANKO] How are you feeling?
Are you... still in pain?

247
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,250
[TATSUMA]
Nah. Thanks for asking.

248
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,333
He was trying...
to look inside my mind

249
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,333
and see all
of my memories.

250
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:50,041
"He"? You mean Kozunu?

251
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:54,041
[TATSUMA] But instead
I felt what he felt...

252
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:59,375
A deep, intense
sadness inside him.

253
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,666
I want to save him, too.

254
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,375
I want to save the soul
of Tendo Kozunu.

255
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,416
[RAITO]
Don't give me that shit!

256
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,166
Save him? What a joke.

257
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,208
That son of a bitch! He's the
only one I wanna see suffer!

258
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,375
Like I told you before,

259
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,250
we fight to protect,
not to punish.

260
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,708
[ANKO] But look at what
he did to Sayo Hirasaka.

261
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,041
[KOMAKI] She's right.
I couldn't save

262
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,041
somebody like him.
Not ever.

263
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,583
[TATSUMA] Aoi also
wanted to protect...

264
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,291
This is what she wants, too.

265
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,375
I've never been
more sure of that.

266
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,541
Hiyu?

267
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,875
Man, you are such a dumbass.

268
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,500
I'm sorry you
think so, but I still...

269
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,208
Okay, I give!

270
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,541
Huh?

271
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,416
Like the old bag said,
I'm not the brightest bulb

272
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,291
in the toolbox. So I guess
we make a pretty good team.

273
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,375
Kyouichi!

274
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,250
Aww. Primal instinct,
like I said...

275
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,083
[IWAYAMA and MAIKO laugh]

276
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,625
[KYOUICHI] So what's that
freak trying to do now?

277
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,458
[RYUZAN]
Well, most likely...

278
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,958
[CLAIRE]
Hey, what are ya doin'?

279
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:23,166
[TENDO] This very ground is
where my ancestors are buried.

280
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,916
[CLAIRE]
Huh?

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,666
[TENDO] My forebears who were
defeated by the Shogunate

282
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,208
committed suicide here.
Members of the Kozunu line

283
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,125
have continued to
sleep here ever since,

284
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:38,041
never having been granted a
proper burial anywhere else...

285
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,625
[CLAIRE]
What are you talking about?

286
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,791
And now I will
resurrect that bloodline--

287
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,833
the bloodline of my
poor, ruined family!

288
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,958
I'll make everything right...

289
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,291
What's that?

290
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,666
What the hell
was that?

291
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,083
Did you hear something, too?

292
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,625
H-Heard what?

293
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,125
[TENDO] Come now to those
who serve and venerate you

294
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:06,000
at this shrine; we implore you,
hasten, heal our ills.

295
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,083
Mirror of the Deep,
Mirror of the Shore,

296
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,833
Eight-Hands-Breadth Sword,
Jewel of Life,

297
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,708
Jewel of Perfection,
Jewel of Resurrection,

298
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,375
Jewel of Warding,
Serpent-Repelling Scarf,

299
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:21,125
Wasp-Repelling Scarf, Scarf of
Multifarious Protection...

300
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,791
Is he bringing back
the Kozunu clan?!

301
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,375
Poor Aoi!

302
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,291
[indistinct murmurs]

303
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:24,291
[AOI whimpers]

304
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:29,333
[AOI screaming]

305
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,291
[screams]

306
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,458
Looks like it's already started.

307
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,000
You don't have
a moment to lose;

308
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,500
you've got to
go bring Aoi back.

309
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,958
Easy for you to say.
Where the hell is she, huh?

310
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,458
Well, master?

311
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,583
[RYUZAN] Hmm...

312
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,541
[MAIKO]
Doctor Iwayama!

313
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:11,166
I can hear her... I can hear
Aoi crying out for help.

314
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,166
Sagaya. You're so
full of it...

315
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,083
I think I can trace
the path of Aoi's mind

316
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,333
to find out where she is.

317
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,708
I'll go too. He mustn't
travel alone.

318
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,875
[IWAYAMA] Don't push
yourself too hard.

319
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,125
[SAGAYA]
Aoi saved my life.

320
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,208
It's time for me
to return the favor.

321
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,083
[MAIKO]
Sure. Now let's go get her.

322
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:48,041
I wasn't able to protect
you in the end. But I...

323
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,416
[KYOUICHI] Whaddaya gonna do?
Still planning on killing her?

324
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,666
Those were my instructions.

325
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,000
Huh. Your instructions, huh?

326
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,416
Well, if that's what
you're gonna do,

327
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,125
I'm not gonna
waste my breath.

328
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,916
But I'm the one you'll
be facing off against.

329
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,791
[KYOUICHI] I'll protect her,
you'll see.

330
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,875
I'm still going to destroy him.
I promise you that.

331
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,041
I'm not going to let you.

332
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,875
Master, what is this?

333
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,083
The demons.

334
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:44,250
It seems the demons are out
taking a little stroll tonight.

335
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,666
[KOMAKI]
Anko, this isn't the time!

336
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,208
[ANKO] You'll tell me
everything that happened?

337
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,750
[KOMAKI] Hm?

338
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,833
Promise me, okay, you guys?
That you'll all come back here

339
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,541
and you'll tell me
the whole story!

340
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,375
Sure, Anko.

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,041
[AZUMABASHI]
Heya, Boss!

342
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,875
H-Hey! What're you--?

343
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,833
Sorry we're late! I brought
the whole gang with me.

344
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:22,208
All that's left for us
is to just sit and wait.

345
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,333
Seems to me the kids have
everything under control.

346
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:29,041
I suppose that, too,
is our star of fate.

347
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,916
[KYOUICHI] Heh. This is
gonna be one hell of a party.

348
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,083
So make sure you're ready
to fight. Now let's roll!

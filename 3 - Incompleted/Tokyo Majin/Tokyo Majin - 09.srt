Hi.

172
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,416
You know... you can talk to me.

173
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,375
This is...
This is where it all started.

174
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,000
[YUUYA]
So this is where you are?

175
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:28,416
It seems had forgotten something
very important. I'm sorry.

176
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,750
[YUUYA] I didn't
consider your feelings.

177
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:41,666
What your favorite foods are, or
what you really like to eat.

178
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,416
[giggles]

179
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,791
What's this?

180
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,791
Sakurai... What happened
to you the other day

181
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,125
must have been difficult.

182
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,000
[YUUYA] Something like that
could effect anyone, even me...

183
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:05,583
But I know that you can overcome
this. So I want you to cheer up.

184
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:11,166
So Sakurai,
I will protect you!

185
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,166
Please you have nothing to fear,
and protect whatever it is

186
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,916
you want to protect!

187
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,916
[KOMAKI]
Daigo...

188
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:39,208
[GIRL IN FIRE] Aoi... Help!
Aoi! Help me... Aoi!

189
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,083
It's unsightly, isn't it? But I
would have endured a hundred

190
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:51,000
times worse if I could have
saved my friend back then.

191
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:55,041
[AOI] This is my stigma for
not being able to help her.

192
00:16:55,125 --> 00:17:01,041
I'm afraid, terribly afraid of
people suffering or dying.

193
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,166
I think about how terrifying
and painful it must have been

194
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,500
for all those people who
were killed by demons

195
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,041
or who even became demons.

196
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,208
Those thoughts consume me so
much that I feel like I'm

197
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,208
being crushed sometimes.

198
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,666
I feel like I'm being pushed
around by some sort of massive

199
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,875
force that I
can't do anything about.

200
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,875
I guess that's
what we call fate, huh?

201
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,416
Maybe, you're right about that.

202
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,625
That's...

203
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,166
[TATSUMA]
Here.

204
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,750
I've had this birthmark all my
life. It made me feel different

205
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:39,041
from all the other kids.
I hated it.

206
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,583
But my father told me that
it was a special symbol that

207
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,375
I'll need someday, and
I need to take care of it.

208
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,708
I think I finally understand
what he meant when I came to

209
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,791
Magami High. Fighting all the
demons, it feels like I'm

210
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,333
finally realizing
life's purpose. Even if this is

211
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,416
my fate,... I'm glad
that I'm able to become

212
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,916
friends with all of you.

213
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,333
So let's face our fate
together without any fear.

214
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,500
Even if we don't know
where it might lead us.

215
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,291
[insects chirping]

216
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,041
[downtown traffic]

217
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,375
[people screaming]

218
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,083
[YUUYA]
What the hell's that?

219
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,166
That girl, she has no aura.

220
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,583
[AOI]
Huh?

221
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,958
Hey, do you think, she's going
to be more trouble than

222
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,333
the last one?

223
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,291
She's being
engulfed by the energy.

224
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,458
[AOI]
Please stop this!

225
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,916
[KYOICHI] Give it a rest! You
won't get through to her now!

226
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,250
That energy will
swallow your will!

227
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,125
[shrill screaming]

228
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,166
[KYOICHI]
Here it comes!

229
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,875
[screaming]

230
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,250
[AOI] It's no use!
I can't hold it!

231
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,041
[AOI]
Komaki!

232
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,666
[YUUYA]
Sakurai!

233
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,875
Thanks for the lunch box.
It was really good.

234
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,416
[KYOICHI] Keep your focus!
She's on her feet.

235
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,208
[maniacal giggling]

236
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,958
[screaming]

237
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,916
[screaming]

238
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,583
[YUUYA]
What a disaster.

239
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,125
[KOMAKI] Did she
use up all her power?

240
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:26,833
[YUUYA] Is this... Is this how
everyone with the Power ends up?

241
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,166
If you can stay
in control of yourself,

242
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,083
I'm sure you'll be okay.

243
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,166
Stop it.
You can't save her now.

244
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:41,250
[AOI] Don't die! Live!
Please... live! Live!

245
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:47,125
[choking]

246
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,541
A-Aoi!

247
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,416
[evil laughter]

248
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,791
There she is! I found you,

249
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,708
bo-dhi-satt-va eye!

250
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,708
[evil laughter continues]

251
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,625
[KOMAKI]
It's totally awesome!

252
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,375
I had no idea you had
power like that!

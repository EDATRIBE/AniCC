01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:12,250
Time and time again...

181
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:14,958
you came through for all of us.

182
01:13:15,916 --> 01:13:19,000
[TATSUMA] You may not have
realized it, but believe me

183
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:24,833
Kyouichi, Sakurai, Daigo,
all the others, we all have.

184
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:26,791
We were only able to
make it this far

185
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,916
because you were there for us,

186
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,625
because you put yourself
in harm's way to protect us.

187
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:37,708
Listen to me. We all need you.

188
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,291
I don't care what kind
of power you have.

189
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:42,916
I'm going to do whatever
I can to protect you.

190
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,833
We're all going to try.

191
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:48,750
We're going to do our
best to keep you safe.

192
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:50,958
I promise.

193
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:55,833
[TATSUMA]
Please, come back to us...

194
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:57,541
Aoi...

195
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:02,916
[gasps]

196
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,208
[growling]

197
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:08,541
Could it be?!

198
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:14,166
[yells]

199
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:27,000
[sobs softly]

200
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:29,125
He couldn't have
broken my spell!

201
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:32,333
Aoi is--Aoi is mine,
do you hear me?!

202
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:35,041
[TENDO] Aoi!

203
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:37,500
You won't hurt them.

204
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:38,666
[gasps]

205
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:42,083
[AOI] I won't let you.
I'll protect them.

206
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:44,041
I'll protect the whole world!

207
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:47,875
[YUUYA yells]

208
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:50,625
[BOTH breathing heavily]

209
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:58,625
[MONSTER groans]

210
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:05,750
Movin' kinda slow...
huh, dungeon master?

211
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:07,250
Shut up and fight, simpleton.

212
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:08,750
Ha! Well, well.

213
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:11,583
Kisaragi, looks like still
got a little fight left in ya.

214
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:13,833
[KYOUICHI] So have you made up
your mind on your duty yet?

215
01:15:13,916 --> 01:15:15,625
Stop talking.

216
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:20,916
[RAITO] To protect...

217
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:32,416
Fight to protect...

218
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:36,583
K-Kill her! I have no
further use for that girl!

219
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:40,000
Kill the Bodhisattva Eye and
every last one of her friends!

220
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:41,458
[KYOUICHI] Let's finish this!

221
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,375
[grunts]

222
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,500
Daigo!

223
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:48,333
Haven't I already said,

224
01:15:48,416 --> 01:15:50,875
I'm never gonna let
anything happen to you.

225
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:52,833
[MONSTER yells]

226
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,458
[MONSTER yells]
[KISARAGI screams]

227
01:15:57,541 --> 01:15:59,083
Hisui, no!

228
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:00,541
Huh?

229
01:16:02,208 --> 01:16:05,041
Even if it... costs my life.

230
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,291
You're so predictable,
ya furry hairball.

231
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:11,958
Get... outta my face!

232
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:16,541
[grunting]

233
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:21,666
This looks like a
good time to leave.

234
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,416
[CLAIRE] Everything's got
this out of control

235
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,958
because you refused
to listen to his orders.

236
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:28,375
Betcha you sure
feel dumb now, huh?

237
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:31,208
[quavers]

238
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:36,958
[yells]

239
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:43,750
[MONSTER yells]

01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:46,125
[screams]

241
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:47,666
[gasps]

242
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:57,583
[RAITO yells]

243
01:17:20,958 --> 01:17:22,666
[yells]

244
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:34,083
Oh, Mother...

245
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:39,833
Recognize your toy?
I wanted to make sure

246
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:42,333
you got it back,
you fuckin' asshole!

247
01:17:42,416 --> 01:17:46,500
[screams]

248
01:18:03,041 --> 01:18:03,958
Ah!

249
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:05,500
Do you think that means...?

250
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:08,875
It seems...
like they did it.

251
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:10,291
[ANKO giggles]

252
01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:23,166
Is it over?

253
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,333
Hey you haven't seen
the other two, have you?

254
01:18:25,416 --> 01:18:27,458
[AZUMABASHI]
What?! We lost 'em?!

255
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:29,791
We screwed up
pretty good this time.

256
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:31,583
Now we're not gonna
be able to get anywhere!

257
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,791
How'm I gonna face the boss?

258
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:46,041
[TENDO whimpers]

259
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:48,416
[KYOUICHI] Hey.

260
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,000
Pretty sweet jamboree. Hmm?

261
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:52,083
[laughs]

262
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:53,958
"Jam session."

263
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:55,791
Hello!

264
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:58,666
[TATSUMA] Ah!
Miss Takamizawa.

265
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:01,041
[MAIKO chuckles]
We had to join you.

266
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:02,791
[AOI] Reiji! You must
be feeling better.

267
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:04,791
[SAGAYA] Yeah. I could
say the same to you.

268
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:06,750
[KOMAKI] What are the
two of you doing here?

269
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:09,250
We know that you think
we'll just get in your way.

270
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:11,875
And we might not
be able to help much...

271
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:13,583
but still...

272
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,875
[BOTH chuckle softly]

273
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:18,333
[TENDO groans]

274
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:20,083
You filthy insects...

275
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:23,291
Please stop! I felt
your painful sorrow.

276
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:25,916
I felt it when you put me
in contact with your heart.

277
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,958
I know that's why
you're doing all of this;

278
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:30,416
to end your sadness... But--

279
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,875
Shut up!

280
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:38,125
[TENDO] Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up, shut up!

281
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:42,041
You scum... You bastards!

282
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:46,416
[AOI] Tatsuma.

283
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:58,791
[TATSUMA] Tendo. Kozunu.

284
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:03,041
I want... to save you, too.

285
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:06,208
Don't give me that shit!

286
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:08,416
[gasps]

287
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,541
[TENDO grunting]

288
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:12,791
Hiyu! Huh?

289
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,750
Kyouichi?

290
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:17,458
[grunting]

291
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:20,250
[TENDO] Why do you despise
the Kozunu line so much?!

292
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:23,041
You're the one who gave
birth to me! This world...

293
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:25,250
[exhales heavily]
The whole world!

294
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:28,958
You stupid people!
You all--you all made me!

295
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:32,875
This world can--
it can--it can just--

296
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,625
[gasps]

297
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,416
[TATSUMA] Even so...

298
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:44,458
I still want to... save you.

299
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:47,041
[yells]

300
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:50,583

01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:09,166
[TENDO groaning]

303
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:13,125
It's not--it's not over.

304
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:14,583
No.

305
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:18,458
Not so soon...

306
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:23,208
[TENDO] Mother,
make sure you watch, okay?

307
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:28,750
I can still do it. I can.

308
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,708
I can...!

309
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:35,416
[ALL gasp]

310
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,541
[KYUICHI] What now?

311
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,708
[grunts]

312
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:39,166
[gasps]

313
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:48,958
[TENDO] How...?

314
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:52,291
What's going on?

315
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:53,750
[DEMONS moaning]

316
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:58,375
No. Let go!
Let go of me!

317
01:21:58,458 --> 01:21:59,541
--Kozunu!
--What are you doin'?

318
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:00,750
Get back!

319
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:01,666
But he--

320
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,708
[CLAIRE screams]

321
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:09,083
What did I do? Lord Yagyu!
Lord Yagyu, please don't!

322
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:14,125
This does not
look good, you guys.

323
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:15,291
Let's get out of here.

324
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:16,500
Tatsuma!

325
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:18,666
Give it up already!
He's toast!

326
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,875
[KYOUICHI] We gotta go!

327
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:23,291
[running footsteps]

328
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,041
[YAGYU] And so
one star has fallen.

329
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,833
The foolish...
young Tendo Kozunu.

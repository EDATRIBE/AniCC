[hysterical scream]

00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,291
[RYOICHI]
Who the hell are you two?!

5
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:57,083
[TENDO] How about if
I give you some power?

6
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:00,083
Doing this isn't gonna
accomplish anything, man.

7
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,458
You hate them, right?
You want to get back at them,

8
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:06,583
don't you? Those guys
who made an ass of you...

9
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,333
Then why don't you do just that?

10
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:11,125
There's nothing that can stop
you! 'Cause you, lucky boy,

11
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,000
have been chosen!
You don't have to worry about

12
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,416
those idiots anymore!

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,625
Just kill them!

14
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,291
Do them in!

15
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,750
You hear what I'm saying?
End all of their lives!

16
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,333
It's so easy!

17
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,083
Just become a demon.

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,375
[TENDO] I'll show you what's
known as...the Dark Arts.

19
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,083

00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:20,375

[MARIA]
Good morning!

24
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,416
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

25
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,916
[KYOICHI] Gotta love
those summer uniforms, huh?

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,791
I think girls should
have to wear short skirts

27
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,000
whether it's hot
or cold out, don't you?

28
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,958
Or better yet, make
'em all wear swimsuits!

29
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,416
You know what that
would be? Sexual harassment.

30
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,083
Oh, come on,
lighten up, would ya?

31
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,041
[KYOICHI]
Hey.

32
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,375
Whaddaya say we, uh, head
down to the beach and pick up

33
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,291
some honeys this summer, huh?

34
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,125
Hmm.

35
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,750
What?

36
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,916
[TATSUMA] You're not
being serious are you?

37
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,375
[KYOUCHI]
Man, Tatsuma.

38
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,916
Why can't you just
let a guy dream, huh?

39
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,291
[GIRL] Do you
know what this is?!

40
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,750
[GIRL'S FRIEND]
Is that a Crow CD?!

41
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,291
[EXCITED GIRL]
Whoa!

42
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,666
Is that the unfinished one that
they've been talking about?

43
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,166
[KOMAKI] So, what are you
gonna do over the summer, Aoi?

44
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,541
Huh?

45
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,791
There's a tournament
that's gonna keep me pretty busy

46
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,083
the first couple of
weeks of the break.

47
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,041
But I wanna make
sure that we can still--

48
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,666
I know!
Maybe we can go on vacation!

49
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,208
I mean, this is gonna be
our last summer together

50
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,583
as high-schoolers, so we
should make it fun, right?

51
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,833
I'm sorry, but I
can't go anywhere.

52
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,375
Why not? 'Cause
student council? Oh!

53
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,333
The college entrance exams...

54
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,041
No, that isn't it.

55
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,458
Aoi! Listen: you've
got to let it go!

56
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,166
[clock tower strikes]

57
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,208

[STUDENT]
Teacher in the room.

59
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,208
Aoi, we'll
talk about this later.

60
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,208
Right.

61
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,250
[STUDENT]
Bow.

62
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,666
[STUDENT]
Return to your seats.

63
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,875
[TEACHER] So, this will be my
third time lecturing at this

64
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,500
school, and as you know today's
lecture will cover questions

65
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,958
that came up during
my previous visits...

66
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,333
[KISARAGI] It was a demon
that attacked you the other day.

67
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,666
[YUUYA]
A...what, now?

68
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,125
[KOMAKI]
A demon? You mean, like...

69
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,125
[KISARAGI] Demons do exist.
They've made themselves known

70
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,166
numerous times
throughout history.

71
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,875
But in recent years
they've tended to remain

72
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,750
hidden in the shadows.

73
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,083
Are you telling us that demons
are behind all those murders?

74
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,583
[AOI] But how...how can
you be so sure, Hisui?

75
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,583
[KISARAGI] For generations it
has been my family's "duty"

76
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,041
to fight these creatures of
darkness, no matter the cost.

77
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,583
Lady Misato, I
never would've imagined

78
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,083
that you'd become involved.

79
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,041
I can't believe this.
This is just total crap!

80
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,375
Oh, come on!

81
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,333
You were there, you saw
it with your own two eyes.

82
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,000
I still don't know...

83
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:53,958
All right!

84
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,291
[KYOICHI]
So, like, this uh...

85
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,666
power thing... that we used.

86
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,333
What is that exactly?

87
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,583
[KISARAI]
I'm not sure.

88
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,083
[KYOICHI]
Huh?

89
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,958
[KISARAGI] But still, even if I
could explain it in full,

90
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,500
I doubt you could comprehend it.

91
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,875
[KYOICHI]
Huh, what did you just say?!

92
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,916
Hisui, please.

93
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,750
There is something known
as the "Dragon Stream."

94
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,333
Dragon Stream?

95
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,958
[KISARAGI] It's a current of chi
that flows throughout the earth.

96
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:20,666
Oh!

97
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,041
I know about chi!

98
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,708
It's that, y'know Feng
Shui hocus-pocus, isn't it?

99
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,375
It tells you if you put
your couch by the front door

100
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,083
or across the room determines
whether you're gonna be

101
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,208
happy or rich, right?

102
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,666
So, you gonna be an
interior decorator now?

103
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,166
Knock it off.

104
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,750
Knock what off?

105
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,041
[KISARAGI] There's been a
disturbance in the current

106
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,625
of the Dragon Stream.

107
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,875
I think that could be the reason
the demons seem to be making

108
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,375
a resurgence of late.

109
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:47,541
Add to that your
powers, as well as...

110
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,666
In any event,
I'll take care of this.

111
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,333
Until then, I'm asking
you to please try to stay

112
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,166
out of harms way.

113
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,458
I trust that that's
understood, Lady Misato?

114
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,791
Aoi... where could you
have disappeared to?

115
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:13,500
Uh hey, Sakurai? You know I
brought some meat and potato

116
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:17,250
stew today, but I made a little
bit too much just for me, so

117
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,083
if you wanna, uh.. y'know,
maybe have lunch with me, then--

118
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,375
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

119
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,833
[YUUYA]
Wait! Hold on!

120
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,250
It took me three days
to learn how to make it...

121
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,291
[COOK]
Here you go, nice and hot.

122
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,541
I'll bring the bowl
back after school.

123
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,625
I sure would
appreciate it, Kyoach.

124
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,333
I told you, don't call me that!

125
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,750
[COOK]
Aloha, Kyoach.

126
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,125
What?

127
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,500
I just wanted to thank
you for the other day.

128
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,500
What?

129
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,125
When the Mor-yo
demon attacked us.

130
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,541
Oh...

131
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,250
If the two of you hadn't
been on lookout someplace else,

132
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,375
that thing might have
claimed even more victims.

133
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,208
So I wanted to
thank you in person,

134
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,583
for all the quick thinking.

135
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,125
So, thank you, from
the bottom of my heart.

136
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,833
I imagine that was your plan,
to split away from the rest of

137
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,625
the group to save more lives?

138
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,208
[KYOICHI]
Huh?

139
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,666
[AOI] If we'd all stayed
together in one spot...

140
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,583
well, the demon
may have gotten away.

141
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,375
But you anticipated that and--

142
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,083
[KYOICHI] Let's not read too
much into this, all right?

143
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,708
It makes me sick how you guys
pretend to be best buddies

144
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,541
with each other all the time.

145
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,583
[AOI]
But, Kyoichi...

146
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,166
And you can quit
hovering around me,

147
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,083
'cause I ain't
buying into your crap!

148
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,375
I'm not lookin' to join forces
with you losers or anyone else.

149
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,416
To be honest with you,
I don't give a rat's ass

150
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,250
if anyone dies over this!

151
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,458
I just want the
chance to test my strength

152
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,083
against somebody
who's worth my time!

153
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,875
Got that?

154
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,041
[AOI] But... Even so... none of
us really understand anything

155
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,250
about our powers in the first
place, so... don't you think it

156
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,041
would be better if... well,
Hisui thinks it would be better

157
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,333
if we all joined forces and--

158
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,250
And have you get in
my way? Forget it!

159
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,500
[KYOUICHI] You'd just
be dead weight in a fight

160
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,958
and you know it.

161
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,291
If I had nine lives to
spare then maybe, maybe

162
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,125
I'd consider
teaming up with you.

163
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,875
[KYOUICHI] If you don't like
hearing that maybe you should go

164
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,333
do something useful on your own.

165
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,541
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,416
Aw, shit.

167
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,166
Now my food's all cold.

168
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,208
[TATSUMA] You might've gone
a little overboard.

169
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,250
But I understand how you feel.

170
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,458
[KYOICHI]
How I feel?

171
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,916
[MARIA] Mr Inugami!
I figured I'd find you here.

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,208
What?

173
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,708
Don't you "what" me!
You and I've got a problem

174
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,125
if you don't attend
that meeting.

175
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,458
What meeting?

176
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,916
About guidance counseling
over summer vacation!

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,708
Oh.

178
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,125
That's right.

179
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,958
A lot of disturbing stuff has
been going on lately,

180
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,458
and we never know
what's gonna happen

181
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,000
once those kids are
away from us on break.

182
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,333
And they're having
enough trouble as it is

183
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,208
with entrance exams
coming up, you know.

184
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,166
I'm telling you all
this assuming that you care

185
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,041
about your students'
emotional states and how they--

186
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,250
Oh!

187
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,791
[MARIA]
What is it?

188
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,708
You've been hurt very
badly in the past, haven't you?

189
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,583
Tell me, what happened?

190
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,000
Ugh!

191
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,583
Why did I even bother?!
I've had about enough of you.

192
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,958
[INUGAMI] Worried about
my students, are you?

193
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,041
Well, aren't you
the model teacher...

194
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,458
[INUGAMI] These are
from central Japan...

195
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:40,458
[KOMAKI] You're really
serious about this, huh?

196
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,875
You know, that
Kisaragi guy said

197
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,250
that we should
stay out of trouble.

198
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,916
I think maybe we
should listen to him.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,833
Who the heck is this guy?

200
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,416
He's the son of an antiques
dealer who worked with my father

201
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,416
and grandfather
for number of years.

202
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,916
He recently inherited
the family business.

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,791
So he'll come by
the house with old pots

204
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,750
or other weird artifacts
that my father's asked him

205
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,875
to find for us, but he...

206
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,916
[terrified scream]

207
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,750
[panting]

208
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,958
[low growl]

209
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,458
[roar]

210
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,708
[snarls]

211
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,083
Tha...that's Kyouichi?

212
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,125
[low growl]

213
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,041
[YUUYA]
What are you two doing here?!

214
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,583
[AOI]
Yuuya?

215
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,875
[KYOUICHI] Meathead?
What the hell are you...

216
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,750
What do you people
think you're doing?!

217
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,333
[KISARAGI] This creature
is not the sort of thing that

218
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,791
you can defeat on your own.

219
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,041
[REPORTER]
It's utter chaos here!

220
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,875
I-I've never witnessed
anything like the panic that's

221
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,375
going on behind me right now!

222
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,875
It's because of the crows!

223
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,291
A huge flock of
crows is attacking--

224
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,875
[REPORTER]
Watch out!

225
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,500
[ANCHORMAN]
Ms. Amano, are you still there?!

226
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,833
[pandemonium]

227
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,166
[MAN IN CAR]
Oh my God!

228
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:31,916
[crash]

229
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,958
[television static]

230
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,333
[KISARAGI]
A call about Lady Misato?!

231
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,541
[KOMAKI]
That's right!

232
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,875
I got a call from one
of her housekeepers.

233
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,000
[YUUYA] She wasn't
at school either.

234
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,916
I thought maybe
she'd be over here, but...

235
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,541
[KOMAKI]
What's going on?

236
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,958
Why did you let her
go out there alone?

237
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,916
I told the five of you that
you'd have to stick together

238
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,708
to fight these demons. From the
start I told you that I'd only

239
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:12,083
assist if you all stuck
together, but now look at you!

240
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,583
It's really easy for you
to stand there and make

241
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,333
accusations, but we
don't know what she does

242
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,875
after she goes home!

243
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,083
[KISARAGI] Quickly!
You've got to go find her

244
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,833
before it's too late.

245
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:22,916
[KOMAKI]
Daigo, let's go!

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,208
[YUUYA]
Right!

247
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,458
[door slams shut]

248
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,750
[KISARAGI]
Lady Misato...

249
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,291
[pandemonium]

250
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,625
[AOI]
I'm so sorry...

251
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,625
[AOI] Someone else is
killed almost every night now...

252
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,958
It seems like the
demons must be behind it.

253
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,458
It makes me feel so restless;
I don't want to just sit back

254
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,083
and let it happen again.

255
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,916
But that doesn't
mean that you have to--

256
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,541
[YUUYA]
I feel the same way.

257
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,791
[KYOICHI] Yeah, and I
just want to know how far

258
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,375
my powers can take me
once it comes down to a fight!

259
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,875
Right, Tatsuma?

260
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,000
[TATSUMA]
Huh?

261
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,750
I think we
should take action.

262
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,375
Please, Hisui,
let me do something!

263
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,958
[KISARAGI]
But, Lady Misato...

264
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,708
[AOI] I can't just do nothing!
If there's any way at all that

265
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,166
I'd be able to
protect somebody...

266
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,250
Or not just one person--
if I could protect the people!

267
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,458
of this city...! Please, Hisui!

268
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,041
I'm begging you!

269
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,250
It seems that the crowd
disturbance is over for now.

270
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:31,541
However, no one can predict when
the next attack might occur.

271
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,250
The experts are
divided on this matter,

272
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,708
but it seems safe to say that it
will likely be some time before

273
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,375
people here feel at ease again.

274
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,916
[siren]

275
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,125
[AOI]
I'm so sorry...

276
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,666
[siren]

277
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,916
Picking through the trash is
one thing,

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,708
but I've never actually
seen a crow attack anyone.

279
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,958
[ANKO] That's because crows
hardly ever attack humans.

280
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,666
It's not in
their nature, you know?

281
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,208
[KYOICHI]
Anko?!

282
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,041
[ANKO] Crows only usually attack
during their breeding season.

283
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,958
Y'know, when someone comes too
close to a nest full of chicks.

284
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,750
But even in those cases
it's just individual birds

285
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,708
that attack,
not an entire flock.

286
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,083
[KYOUICHI]
So...

287
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,875
you wanna tell us what
the hell you're doing here?

288
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,916
You know I could ask
you the same exact thing.

289
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,250
What could possibly motivate
two juvenile delinquents

290
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,291
to investigate this incident?

291
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,583
Oh. Is that what we're doing?

292
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,625
We're not "investigating",
we're just out doing

293
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,625
a little shopping.

294
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,625
For what?

295
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,625
Uh, well it's...

296
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,875
It's for underwear.

297
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:50,916
Ugh.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,083
Man, this guy
can't lie for shit!

299
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,791
Damn!
Stubborn idiot...

300
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,125
[AOI] Let go of me!
Kyouichi, please!

301
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,041
I told you to
stay out of the way!

302
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,666
I'm gonna do anything I can to
help. I know that I might seem

303
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,583
helpless compared to the
rest of you guys and maybe

304
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,750
a little bit weaker, but I--

305
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,458
Glad to hear you understand.

306
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,250
Now get your ass home,
princess.

307
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,333
I won't!

308
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,375
Wha'd you say?

309
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,916
I won't go home.

310
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,583
I'm staying here!

311
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,708
[KYOICHI]
You little...

312
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,250
[KOMAKI]
Horaiji!

313
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,166
Aoi, are you okay?

314
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,333
[KYOUICHI]
Shit, they're all here.

315
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,791
Horaiji! I certainly hope
that you weren't being

316
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,250
a total jerk to Aoi again.

317
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,125
Ha! I was giving your
girlfriend a reality check.

318
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,833
She needs to get her
useless little ass home.

319
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:43,958
Say that again!

320
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:44,875
Stop!

321
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,291
It's okay.

322
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,291
You know, why don't you
go home with her, too? I mean,

323
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,166
it looks to me like you just
wanna have some fun with

324
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,708
Miss Student Council, right?
So why don't you two

325
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,083
run along to her
little mansion and play house?

326
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,375
Asshole!

327
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,625
Sakurai, don't.

328
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,375
Hey, Daigo, don't you
ever get tired of that

329
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,208
"daddy will protect you"
song and dance? I do.

330
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,041
Horaiji! You sonnuva...

331
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,875
Just stop it, everyone!

332
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,166
[ANKO]
What's going on?

333
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,416
Got me...

334
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,666
A demon.

335
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,333
[battle cry]

336
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:37,958
[AOI]
But he's...

337
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:38,958
It's a guy.

338
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,541
Not a demon.

339
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,916
[YUUYA] You're telling
me that he has the Power?

340
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,291
You mean...That guy?

341
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,541
Things got very interesting.

342
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,250
So, do you think
that we should tell him...

343
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,250
That his enemies are here?

344
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,250
[KYOUICHI]
Son of a bitch!

345
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,958
[RAITO] Guess I was
right that you weren't just an

346
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,125
ordinary buncha onlookers.

347
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,791
Horaiji!

348
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:13,958
Not you.

349
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:14,916
Komaki!

350
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,458
Don't argue with me.

351
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,583
You're not strong enough to
fight this guy and you know it.

352
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,666
Please, just
stay out of the way.

353
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,333
Where is Ryoichi?

354
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,708
Ryoichi?
What are you talking about?

355
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,791
Tell me! You've all got
the Power, so there's no way

356
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,583
you don't know!

357
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,500
[RAITO] Are you and Ryoichi in
this together? Did he have

358
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,208
something to do with those
crows attacking everyone?

359
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,583
[KYOICHI] I have no idea
what you're talking about

360
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,166
You're talkin' crazy.

361
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,625
[RAITO] Yeah, like
hell you don't know.

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,791
I'll beat it outta you!

363
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,333
Daigo, get outta the way!

364
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,291
You can't do this on your own.

365
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,500
Sakurai...what the hell?

366
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,833
Sakurai.

367
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,208
[KYOUICHI]
Didn't I tell you to go home?!

368
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,458
[KOMAKI] Shut up!
Don't tell me what to do!

369
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,000
[YUUYA] Stop it, you
guys! Horaiji's right,

370
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,541
you should get outta here.

371
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,166
[RAITO] The three of
you together and this is all

372
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,625
you've got? This is
one hell of a jam session.

373
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,416
Let's rock!

374
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,541
[ANKO]
He's glowing! No.

375
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,750
He's flying! No.

376
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,208
He's glowing again!
Wha-What's going on...?

377
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,000
[explosion]

378
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,583
Man, that was close.

379
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,083
[pained screaming]

380
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,750
[light chuckle]

381
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:28,916
[TATSUMA]
Aoi, no!

382
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,208
Aoi.

383
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,333
Get out of here.

384
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,750
You idiot.

385
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,208
Get the hell out of here
before you get yourself killed.

386
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,291
Go on!

387
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,000
Go home!

388
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,875
I'm protecting you!

389
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,833
It's what I do.

390
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,375
[chuckles]

391
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,958
[RAITO] You sure about that?
'Cause you don't seem to have

392
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,000
very much power...

393
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,166
[AOI] I think that you're
making a huge mistake here.

394
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,291
We're not your enemies.
I have a feeling

395
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,666
we're after the same thing.

396
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,916
I think you're looking
for whoever's behind these

397
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,333
crow attacks, and that's exactly
what we're doing here, too.

398
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,166
We should be working
together instead of trying to

399
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,000
destroy each other.

400
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,208
And what if I said I don't
believe you.

401
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,250
If I have to, I'll fight
you with every ounce of

402
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,833
strength I have!

403
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,583
I'm going to protect my friends
and the people of this city,

404
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,958
no matter what it takes!

405
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,458
[KOMAKI]
Aoi...

406
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,500
Sounds like fun.

407
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,666
Let's see if you can
protect your weak little

408
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,458
friends from this.

409
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:36,625
[battle cry]

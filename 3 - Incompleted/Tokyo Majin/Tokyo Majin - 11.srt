I am Kozunu!

180
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,708
I am Tendo Kozunu!

181
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,458
I get it.

182
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,000
Now I understand why
I was so concerned

183
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,291
about you all this time.

184
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,958
[TENDO] Because you...

185
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,041
Because your people
are the ones...

186
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:51,583
[grunting]

187
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,000
[TENDO] Die.

188
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,750
Die!

189
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,500
[yells]

190
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:10,916
[TATSUMA yelling]

191
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,250
[laughs]

192
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,000
I am just so grateful
that we were fated

193
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,750
to run into each other
here and now,

194
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,875
aren't you, old friend?

195
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,583
[TATSUMA groaning]

196
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:33,916
[TATSUMA continues groaning]

197
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,791
[SAYO] Stop it!

198
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,166
Please, don't do this!
I'm begging you.

199
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,583
You can do whatever you want
to me, but please just...

200
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,916
[SAYO] leave him alone!

201
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,375
[TENDO chuckles]

202
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:51,083
[SAYO gasping]

203
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,125
[SAYO groaning]

204
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,791
[TENDO laughs]

205
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,208
If you've really gotten
to like him that much then

206
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,166
why don't you go to
the other side together?

207
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,458
[SAYO sobs]

208
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,208
[groaning]

209
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,708
Don't look.
Please don't look at me!

210
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,916
This is where the story ends.

211
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,166
Uh! You little--!

212
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,958
[SAYO screams]

213
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:27,875
[monsterous screams]

214
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,250
The balance between the sun
and moon has been altered....

215
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,541
What have you done,
you stupid little bitch?!

216
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,291
[SAYO] Uah!

217
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,625
Sayo, no!

218
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,791
Tatsuma...

219
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:54,333
[SAYO] Tatsuma...
The sweet peas...

220
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,541
let's... let's both...

221
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,875
Try to focus your minds.

222
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,000
[grunts]

223
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,291
[KISARAGI]
Don't listen to their song.

224
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,958
They're chanting a curse!

225
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,250
[gasps]

226
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,208
Someone doesn't
know when to die.

227
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,375
Kozunu...

228
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:48,041
[TATSUMA] Kozunu Tendo!

229
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,041
[TENDO grunts]

230
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,500
[TATSUMA yells]

231
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,000
[TENDO] You! Because
of you! You're the one!

232
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:12,250
Because of you, the Kozunu
family... my mother...!

233
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,708
You killed her.
You killed my mother!

234
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:24,208
[TENDO]
Give my mother back to me.

235
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,291
Give my mother...

236
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,708
[TENDO] back to me!

237
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,958
[yells]

238
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,208
[snickers]

239
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,166
[exhales]

240
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,000
[YUUYA] Sakurai, no!

241
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,625
Sakurai! Sakurai...!

242
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,875
[KISARAGI chanting]

243
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,500
Just hang in there!

244
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:10,666
[YUUYA and KOMAKI groaning]
[KISARAGI continues chanting]

245
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,041
[YUUYA groans]

246
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,500
[KIRASAGI] Even the
Netherworld Hymn is of no use.

247
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,833
Is this of the
Bodhisattva Eye's power?

248
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,958
[KOMAKI] Aoi!

249
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,416
[CLAIRE] Hmm. Come on.

250
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,250
Hurry up and
finish this already?

251
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,416
Huh?

252
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:36,000
[chanting]

253
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,166
[grunts]

254
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,875
[YUUYA] Hey.

255
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:41,916
Tell us who you are.

256
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,958
Is that...?

257
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,125
[YUUYA] It's Raito Uhmon!

258
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,333
I see you guys are
goofing off as usual.

259
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,958
How's it goin', short 'n ugly?

260
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,666
I'm surprised you're
out this late, kid.

261
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,333
It's way past your bedtime!

262
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,166
[CLAIRE]
Why you... Why you...

263
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,666
bed-head freak!

264
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,250
Wow. Well that wasn't
too shabby there...

265
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,666
short 'n ugly.

266
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,000
Uh! One more of you
doesn't make any diff--uh!

267
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,916
[BOTH coughing]

268
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,333
[KOMAKI] What's going on?!

269
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,958
I hate the smell of incense.

270
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,041
[HINANO] Lady Komaki!

271
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,666
I think you should kindly
withdraw from this place.

272
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,375
Hinano? What...
are you doing here?

273
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,833
[CLAIRE] Ew...!

274
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,541
It stinks! Kill them,
Bodhisattva Eye!

275
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,750
You're here too, Yukino?!

276
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,791
It'll be all right,
we'll get you out quickly!

277
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,958
But we--

278
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,500
[RAITO yells]

279
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,666
[grunts]

280
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,041
Oh... poopy pants,
they ran away.

281
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,125
I bet it was that
scary face you're making.

282
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:09,875
[distant engine running]

283
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,916
[tires screeching]

284
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,541
[KYOUICHI] Hey, Tatsuma!

285
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:34,250
[TENDO laughs intensely]

286
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,666
[KYOUICHI] What the hell?

287
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,791
Hey, Tatsuma?

288
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,000
I-I couldn't protect her...

289
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,500
What's that?

290
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,666
[TATSUMA exhales]

291
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,791
Huh. Hey! Tatsuma!

292
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,083
[KYOUICHI] Hey, Tatsuma!

293
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,166
Damnit... Just hang tight.

294
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,791
We'll get you over
that old bag's place!

295
00:21:55,541 --> 00:22:00,000
[AZUMABASHI] Hm. Can the
bike carry three people?

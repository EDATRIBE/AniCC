[AOI ON MACHINE] Hisui?
This is Aoi. Where are you?

00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,833
Are you all right?

7
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,583
[AOI'S MOTHER] Thank you
very much, Mr. Kisaragi.

8
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,333
Oh, my, and who is this?

9
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,125
This is my grandson, Hisui. 

10
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,208
I brought him along
to introduce him to you.

11
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,500
[AOI]
Mom?

12
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,666
[AOI'S MOM] Ah, you're just in
time. Introduce yourself, Aoi.

13
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,875
[AOI]
Sure, mom.

14
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,833
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Aoi Misato.

Good morning, Aoi!

Good morning.

19
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,041
Huh... How are you doing?
Is everything okay?

20
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,791
You seem a little down...

21
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,500
Oh, no... I'm alright.

22
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,708
[KOMAKI] It's nice to know that
even you get a little depressed

23
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,708
at the beginning of a new term.

24
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,375
I'm really disappointed
that we didn't get to hang

25
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,583
out at all
over the summer break.

26
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,208

[GRANDFATHER] Mrs. Misato,
please accept my apologies.

You clumsy child!

34
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,541
[AOI'S MOTHER] Please,
Mr. Kisaragi, it's all right!

35
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,458
Everyone makes mistakes.

36
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,750
I believe you, yourself
have said that we grow

37
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,750
through our mistakes.

00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,916
[GRANDFATHER]
Of course... Hisui,

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
apologize again to Mrs. Misato!

40
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,500
[KISARAGI] I'm really sorry...
Mrs. Misato.

41
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:35,625
[MARIA] All right, Miss Misato,
read this section. Miss Misato?

42
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,500
Y-Yes?

00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,791
[MARIA] Starting from the sixth

Come on. Let's go, Hisui!

[KYOICHI] What's the matter,
Miss Honor Student?

46
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,375
What's up with the
staring off into space

47
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,458
and not taking any notes?

48
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,375
[TATSUMA] You're no where
near as bad as Kyoichi.

00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,708
[KYOICHI]
Huh?

50
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,583
Will you look at this,
well now, here's something

51
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,125
you don't see every day.

52
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,791
Mr. Horaiji and Miss Misato
chatting during school hours?

53
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,666
Did something happen
over summer vacation?

54
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,291
Hah! With "Snooty-Little-Miss
Student-Council"?

55
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,750
[KYOICHI] Actually,
I prefer more mature women.

56
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,416
So whaddya say, Maria, Sweetie?

57
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,000
Wanna hang out
with me some time?

58
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,208
[MARIA] Well, you haven't handed
in your summer homework yet,

59
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,791
have you?

60
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,375
So how about we "hang" out for
some remedial work after school?

61
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,875
[KYOICHI] W-What?
Sorry, I can't hear you!

62
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,041

Remedial work.

in trouble for tearing

67
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,750
one of my father's scrolls.

68
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,166
[KISARAGI]
Huh?

69
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,750
[AOI] I know
exactly how you feel.

70
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,791
Here.

71
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:47,916
[GRANDFATHER] Hisui, as
members of the Kisaragi family,

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,500
we have a very
important obligation.

73
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:57,000
Our family has served the
Misato family through the ages,

74
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,458
and have also served to protect
this city of Tokyo,

75
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,708
since as far back
as the Edo period.

76
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,958
I have told you this many times
and you must always remember.

77
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,541
[KISARAGI]
Yes, sir.

78
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,875
Hisui, listen to me carefully.
It is about time that you also

79
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:19,375
learned of our family's "other"
mission, which we must uphold!

80
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,958
Hisui, I heard...
about your grandfather.

81
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,958
You're worried, too, huh?

82
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,083
Oh, that's right. My mom told me
that we just got some really

83
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,916
good fruit from the market.
I'll go get some for you.

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,916
[KISARAGI]
You needn't trouble yourself.

85
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,083
[AOI]
Just wait right there.

86
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,166
[KISARAGI]
Lady Misato...

87
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:55,166
To think that those creatures
had been revived...

venerate you in this shrine;

I have now taken it on...

103
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,333
I've taken on
all your resentment!

104
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,791
[KOMAKI]
What? Kisaragi?

105
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,666
[AOI] Yeah... And the
shop has had its shutters

106
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,750
closed the whole time.

107
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,875

00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,000

We're in for a storm.

00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,125

something troubling?

00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,541

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,375
Well, you needn't worry, now
that the Kyoko Tono is here!

Look, the latest digital camera!

115
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:29,958
With this, I can...

116
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,333
Who asked you to come?

117
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,750
Simply awful!

118
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,500
Is this any way to
treat the newest member

119
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,083
of the Demonbuster Club?!

120
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,666
Demonbuster Club?

121
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,500

This ain't no damn school club!

00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,541
[GIRL'S FRIEND]
Huh? Where?

00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,125

He's totally yummy!

00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,333

128
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,666
It's Hisui!

129
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,083
How does he keep going?

130
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,958
These are from Hokkaido.

131
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,875
[car idling]

132
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,583
[AOI] Oh my god, Hisui,
what happened to you?

133
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,875
[YUUYA] Hey!
How about saying something?

134
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,041
[TATSUMA]
Kisaragi, you're wounded.

135
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,666
[YUUYA AND KOMAKI]
Huh?

136
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,333
[KYOICHI] Wake up.
Stay with us, Tatsuma.

137
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,750
Uh, Hisui...

138
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,083
[KYOICHI] Please don't
tell us that you fell down

139
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,333
a flight of stairs.

140
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,916
[KISARAGI] I thought the chain
of all the strange incidents

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,916
that have occurred had
been due to some disturbance

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,791
in the Dragon Stream...
But I was wrong.

143
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,875
Someone has been deliberately
causing these events

144
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,208
by practicing the Dark Arts.

145
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,166
[KOMAKI]
The Dark Arts...

146
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,458
[YUUYA] That's right. "Crow Boy"
said something about that?

147
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,583
[KISARAGI] "Dark Arts" is a
general term to denote sorcery,

148
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,958
which lies in opposition
of all that is righteous:

149
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,791
religion, heaven, humanity,
and the Earth itself.

150
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,000
There is something
known as the Demoniacal Art,

151
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,083
the path of the demonic, which
is one of the Dark Arts.

152
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,750
The Demoniacal Art is a
dreadful form of sorcery,

153
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,583
which is used to awaken
the souls of the dead

154
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,583
and summon demons.

155
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,041
There was a certain clan who
used the Demoniacal Art to

156
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,458
incite a rebellion
against the Tokugawa

157
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,375
in the last days
of the shogunate.

158
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,791
[KYOICHI] "Shogunate"?
What era was that again?

159
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,333
The Kurama Tengu era, right?

160
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,750
...Tengu? Those aren't demons!

161
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,250
[KOMAKI] You're thinking
about the TV show, you idiot!

162
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,916
[KISARAGI] I don't know
their reason for revolting,

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,916
but it is said that
this clan augmented their power

164
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,041
through the Demoniacal Arts,
summoning demons using the

165
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:47,541
souls of those who died with a
grudge against the Tokugawa.

166
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:53,875
They called themselves...
the Demoniacal Horde.

167
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,833
What?

168
00:12:55,916 --> 00:13:00,083
It appears as if something
fun is about to start.

169
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,625
[YUUYA]
What does this mean?

170
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:05,375
The Demoniacal Horde
has been revived.

171
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,000
[TENDO] Now all we need
is the bodhisattva eye.

172
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,041
[CLAIRE]
Bo-dhi-satt-va eye?

173
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,375
[KISARAGI] If the Demoniacal
Horde has been revived,

174
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,208
then it's most likely
that their head family,

175
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,916
the Kozunu clan
too has revived.

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,875
[KYOICHI]
They're like the head of a gang?

177
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,708
[KISARAGI]
Correct.

178
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,750
They're trying to wreak havoc
upon this world once again.

179
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,333
By using the darkness in
people's hearts...

180
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,291
What? They're still pissed over
the end of the shogunate?

181
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,416
Talk about a fuckin' grudge!

182
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,208
[AOI]
Hisui?

183
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:53,458
[KISARAGI] I... I will
fight the Demoniacal Horde!

184
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,750
This obligation is
my soul duty as a member

185
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,958
of the Kisaragi family.

186
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,333
Even if I am alone,
I must fight...

187
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,625
...even if it means my death.

188
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:08,291
But you do not have to do this.
You have no reason to fight.

189
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,750
If you feel a need to withdraw
from this, I will not hold it

190
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,875
against you.
It is not too late.

191
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,208
Now that we know we're up
against the Demoniacal Horde,

192
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,041
I cannot guarantee
you're safety.

193
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,208
Is that acceptable to you?
Are you prepared to lay down

194
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,083
your life for all this?

195
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,791
[AOI]
I'll fight too.

196
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,166
I will fight.

197
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,708
[KOMAKI]
Me, too.

198
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,083
Komaki!

199
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,833
[KYOICHI] What, you're
still all worried about that?

200
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,250
Hey, Dungeon Master-

201
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,500
[KISARAGI]
What?

202
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,041
[KYOICHI] So basically
if we take out all these

203
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,208
Kozunu assholes, that be it?

204
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,000
Then there won't be anymore
people turning into demons

205
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,500
and monsters, right?

206
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,000
[KISARAGI]
Yes, that's right.

207
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,666
Hey there, Captain,
get all that?

208
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,041
[KISARAGI]
Lady Masato?

209
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,250
Is something wrong?

210
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,750
[AOI] Oh, I'm sorry,
my mind was just wandering...

211
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,083
I was thinking about
something from long ago.

212
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:37,166
That time you and I snuck away
to see the fireflies?

213
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,791
They're such nice memories...

214
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,916
Lady Masato. Please forgive me.

215
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,666
I shall protect
you without fail.

216
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,375
Oh, Hisui...

217
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,041
[YUUYA]
Whoa. This place is...

218
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,708
[KOMAKI]
Amazing.

219
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,291
[KYOICHI]
It's a bit dreary.

220
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,708
[KISARAGI] These are the sacred
grounds of the Kisaragi family.

221
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,750
Those who would trespass
upon it shall be cursed.

222
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,333
[KOMAKI]
Huh...

223
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,208
[KISARAGI]
Just a silly legend.

224
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,000
We had reason to make sure
people kept their distance

225
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,625
from this place.

226
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,041
[KISARAGI]
Just a silly legend.

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,250
[TATSUMA]
You don't sound like him.

228
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,208
[KISARAGI]
I knew it.

229
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,583
[AOI]
Hisui!

230
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,041
[KYOICHI] So, is that
the shogunate bastards.

231
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,125
[YUUYA] I knew it.
It's the ones from before.

232
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,916
[KOMAKI]
It's those two again.

233
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,916
[TATSUMA]
The Demoniacal Horde...

234
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,583
[TENDO] So, you've finally come.
I've been waiting for you.

235
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,541
The Demoniac Verses.

236
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,541
It is a collection of dark
spells used to summon demons.

237
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,833
My clan had sealed it away,
it appears as if...

238
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,208
[YUUYA]
You guys no longer have it?

239
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,291
[KOMAKI] And you came
here to be double check.

240
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,708
[KYOICHI] For cryin' out loud...
keep your valuables in a safe

241
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,541
or something!

242
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,208
Y'know?

243
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:29,166
[TENDO] A simple barrier
like this can't keep me out.

244
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,916
I have thus been able
to revive the Demoniacal Horde

245
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,625
without trouble.

246
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,958
Thank you so very much,
Kisaragi descendant.

247
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,000
[KISARAGI] You bastard...
Tell me your name?!

248
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,666
Kozunu...
Tendo Kozunu.

249
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,333
Tendo...
Kozunu...

250
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,875
[TENDO]
Kill them.

251
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,625
[screaming]

252
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,208
[KYOICHI]
Shut the hell up!

253
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,500
[KISARAGI]
No... This is...

254
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,333
Ah!!

255
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,000
Aoi!

256
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,416
[KOMAKI] What...
What is this?!

257
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,000
Stop it!

258
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:34,833
[KYOICHI]
Damn it.

259
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,958
Are you my enemies?!

260
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,416
[KISARAGI] I, Hisui Kisaragi,
shall not make the same

261
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,541
mistake twice!

262
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,333
[all screaming]

263
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,583
[KYOICHI]
Shit!

264
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,416
[TATSUMA]
Kyoichi!

265
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,291
[TENDO]
Not bad!

266
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,125
So tell me, where is it?

267
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,291
I found the Demoniac Verses
easy enough...

268
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,333
but I haven't had the same luck
with the "other" thing.

269
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,625
Come, tell me.

270
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,458
That's the only reason
I let you live before.

271
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,583
You know what they say,
what goes around comes around.

272
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,750
[TENDO] Now then,
what to do, what to do...

273
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,958
I've grown weary of you.

274
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:54,500
Guess I'll have to kill you all,
and look for it at my own pace.

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,833
[KISARAGI]
Lady Misato...

276
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,000
What are you...
looking at?

277
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,750
I don't care for
the look in your eyes.

278
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,166
What was that?!

279
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,416
[CLAIRE]
Boooring...

280
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,458
You all get out of here!

281
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:47,958
[TENDO] Sealed in a tube? That
explains why I couldn't find it!

282
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,500
In any case,
that is what I need.

283
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,541
The Eight-Hands-Breadth Sword...

284
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,916
What do you plan to do
with the ten sacred treasures?

285
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,125
[yawns]

286
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,625
Not again...

287
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:22,000
[CLAIRE] This dress was a gift
from a very special person!

288
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:27,250
You shall all die!

289
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,583
[people screaming]

290
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,541
[YUUYA] You knew they'd come.
Didn't you, Kisaragi?

291
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,958
[KISARAGI]
Yes.

292
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,833
[KOMAKI] Huh?! Then you knew we
could have been killed?!

293
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,625
[KYOICHI]
Get a grip, Sakurai!

294
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,208
[KOMAKI]
But...

295
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,666
If we couldn't handle what just
happened, then we'd be no match

296
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,375
for the Demoniacal Horde, right?

297
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,083
So then this
was all a test, huh?

298
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,333
I had to make sure.

299
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,416
Pft, that's nice.

300
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,791
Komaki?

301
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:05,708
Hmm.

302
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,791
[KISARAGI] The five of you
did a good job tonight.

303
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,666
So I'll treat
you guys to dinner.

304
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,666
I recall you mentioning your
favorite ramen establishment

305
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,208
was around here somewhere?

306
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,833
[KYOICHI] Hey, now you're
speaking my language,

307
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,250
Dungeon Master!

308
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,333
Okay, I'll have a
large miso battered kimchi

309
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,541
roasted pork ramen!

310
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,583
[KISARAGI]
I'm not paying for yours.

311
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,875
[KYOICHI]
What?! But you...

312
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:24,791
[KISARAGI]
Not paying.

313
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:25,625
[KYOICHI]
You just said...!

314
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,333
[KISARAGI]
Not for you!

315
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,208
[RYUZAN]
The time has come.

1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,250
[YUKINO] The five Buddhist
shrines that sealed the demons

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,791
have been destroyed.

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,875
[HINANO] Along with the seals
under Kisaragi's protection

4
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,041
were also broken...

5
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,125
[YUKINO] The Eight-Hands-Breadth
Sword was found and

6
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,750
stolen by the
Demoniacal Horde.

7
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,875
And the vessel
of the Golden Dragon?

8
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:26,083
[HINANO] He was there
and was in contact.

9
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,583
[RYUZAN]
I see.

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,666
It appears the stars
of fate are on the move.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,208
[gentle breezze]

12
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,291
This isn't it...
this won't do.

13
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,083
[SAKUYA]
This arm...

14
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,291
[screaming]

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,625
[maniacal laughter]

16
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,791
[choking]

17
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,458
[screaming]

18
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,250
You stay back.

19
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,083
Hiiyah!

20
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,750
[KYOICHI]
Not too bad...

21
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,000
But!

22
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,458
You're gonna need more than
technique if you wanna win.

23
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,333
Come on!
One more time!

24
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,125
[KYOICHI] Why don't
you just give it up?!

25
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,708
Please, once more!

26
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,541
You're not gonna get any better
if you let your emotions

27
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,583
get control of you.

28
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,250
[ANKO] There were
more attacks last night.

29
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,083
[YUUYA] There're been
a lot of incidents lately.

30
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,541
[KOMAKI] I have a strange
feeling it's not all demons.

31
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,083
You're exactly right.

32
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,125
[ANKO] There've been more
and more copycat incidents

33
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,708
to look like demons.

34
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,791
At this point, it's hard
to tell which ones are real

35
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,375
and which ones are fake.

36
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:48,208
People are dying around here.
There's nothing fake about that.

37
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,708
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,208
But why so many?

39
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,250
Guess all this means is that
there's no difference between

40
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,375
people and demons.

41
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:03,208
So, what is it
that you do know?

42
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,791
This one that's been going after
members of athletic clubs...

43
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,708
It kinda feels like the work of
demons to me. What do you think?

44
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,500
The news reports that "part of
the body" has been dismembered,

45
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,208
but it's the arms they're going
for, the right arm to be exact.

46
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,875
Why would anyone...?

47
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,833
[KYOICHI]
What does Kisaragi say?

48
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,541
Nothing, really.

49
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,958
It's impressive to see how hard
you guys have been working, even

50
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,583
doing this special
training and all...

51
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,708
And Aoi even dusted
off her old na-gi-na-ta!

52
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,958
I had no idea!

53
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,791
Without strength in my
moves with the naginata,

54
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,166
I don't know if
I can help to fight.

55
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,333
Aoi will be okay.
We all decided to do this.

56
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,916
That's right,
we'll all do it together!

57
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,666
This will have to do.

58
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,583
[MIKURIYA's PARTNER] Get the sea
lice to the lab for analysis.

59
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,791
[DETECTIVE] It's possible 
the same culprit's behind both

60
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,833
the I-ha-ra parasite incident
and the No-za-wa incident.

61
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,208
Ko-zu-ka's barnacle incident
seems to resemble the I-wa-ta

62
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,750
murder from the other day.

63
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,750
The man killed in Miya Park
appears to be a copycat murder

64
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,416
after the unusual
string of incidents.

65
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,333
We've got the suspect in
custody back at the station.

66
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,041
[phone ringing]

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,750
[RYUTA]
Hey, it's me.

68
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,791
About that high school student
from the other day...

69
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,291
[MIKURIYA]
The one with the holes?

70
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,916
Yeah. They're not holes.
They're honeycomb cells...

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,416
like that of a beehive. And
just like the other incidents,

72
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,708
the right arm
was completely severed.

73
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,416
[ambulance siren]

74
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,750
Hey, I said I'm sorry! I didn't
think I'd actually hit you!

75
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,291
[KYOICHI]
Oh, man.

76
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,708
Hey, Tatsuma, what's that?

77
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,625
Long underwear!

78
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:08,458
Underwear? You mean that
time from the other day?

79
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,583
[KYOICHI] You weren't making
that shit up to fool her?

80
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,833
[TATSUMA] Yeah. You do realize
it will be getting cold soon.

81
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,208
[KYOICHI]
And how old are you?

82
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,500
[ANKO]
This shatters the image of the

83
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,750
mysterious transfer student!

84
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,708
[TATSUMA] They're not for me.
I was planning to send them

85
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,166
to my dad.

86
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,791
[KYIOCHI]
Okay, I certainly hope so.

87
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,541
[YUUYA] "Send" it to him? So,
he lives away from your family?

88
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,708
No, I do.

89
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,000
I live in Tokyo on my own.

90
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,208
Really?
A new detail uncovered!

91
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:39,208
The mysterious transfer student
is living "on his own"?!

92
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:43,208
Lucky him, it seems like it
must be fun living all alone.

93
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,958
[YUUYA] Your parents couldn't
come to Tokyo with you?

94
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,500
Well, at their age it
would be too difficult.

95
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,333
Really, how old are they?

96
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,708
And so... you live apart from
your parents? Not simply apart,

97
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,250
but as a high school student
living alone in Tokyo!

98
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:00,250
[ANKO] Wow! Why is that? What's
the reason for your situation?

99
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,625
Alright already. Let's go get
some ramen. I'm starvin'.

100
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,375
[KOMAKI]
Well, I have archery practice,

101
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,875
so I'll see you guys later.

102
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:11,125
Oh, right. You've got that
tournament coming up, right?

103
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,250
Yeah, this will be my last
archery tournament at the

104
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,666
high school level.
I got to do my best.

105
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,666
You will come to watch,
right, Aoi?

106
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,291
Uh, yeah, sure!

107
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,083
Um... Hey, I'll come to
cheer you on, too, Sakurai.

108
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,541
Thanks, guys!

109
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
[CLAIRE] Why don't
you stop fussing over this

110
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,333
Kisaragi guy or whoever, and
go for something bigger?

111
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,625
[TENDO] You do know it's your
fault my plan went awry.

112
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,208
[CLAIRE]
Oh, shut up...

113
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,000
[TENDO] The seeds have
been sown, haven't they?

114
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,625
[CLAIRE] We haven't done very
much and I know that "he"

115
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,000
won't be happy about it.

116
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:43,833
[cat meows]

117
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,458
[Tendo laughs]

118
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,083
What's so funny?!

119
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:51,333
 Oh, nothing. I couldn't
care less about your "him".

120
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,416
I will do whatever I please.
Understand?

121
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,708
[TENDO] Where the hell are they?
The Dragon Stream should have

122
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:06,166
activated their powers. They
should have appeared by now.

123
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,166
And that one's
getting on my nerves.

124
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,291
[NEWS ANCHOR] This is supposedly
an effect of gelidium jelly.

125
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,000
[NEWS ANCHOR]
Our other top story...

126
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,583
Police have identified the body
that was found on the roadside

127
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,375
of Na-ka-mu-ra in the Ne-ri-ma
ward in the early morning

128
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,958
of the 20th. The victim is
20-year-old E-i-ta I-ke-da.

129
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,000
[YUUYA] So where do
you guys want to go?

130
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,875
[KYOICHI]
The usual spot, of course.

131
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,041
[TATSUMA] Say, Kyoichi, do
they have strawberry ramen?

132
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,291
--What? 
--You...You there!

133
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,666
I sense a very powerful light
emanating from you...

134
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,791
This light is mighty and
illuminates all.

135
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,750
Master Arai!

136
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,208
It has been some time, Daigo.

137
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,958
It's so good to see you.
When did you get back?

138
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,041
I returned just the other day.

139
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,708
What can this old geezer
possibly be a "master" of?

140
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,083
Watch your mouth, Kyoichi!

141
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,291
It's quite all right.
My name is Ryuzan Arai and

142
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,416
you two are Daigo's friends
from school, I take it?

143
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,875
--What? 
--Did he say "friend"?

144
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,375
[YUUYA] We all go to the same
school, his name's Houraiji.

145
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,416
And that's Hiyu.

146
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,500
[RYUZAN]
You have a nice face, young man.

147
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,333
[light laugh]

148
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:40,250
Daigo, has it begun? Has
time begun to flow inside you?

149
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,708
[MIKURIYA]
A nasty affair...

150
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,625
They say the bodies were
completely dried up. If you

151
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,666
think about it, it's pretty
disturbing 'cause it seems like

152
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,583
this is happening
more often around here.

153
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,250
I wonder what the police are
doing about this? But even if

154
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,416
they do catch whoever's
behind these incidences,

155
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,250
that's not going to bring
back the dead, you know?

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,833
Christ. You have to
feel really bad for all

157
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,416
the victims' families.

158
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,166
I'm sorry, Excuse me.

159
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:41,583
[SAKUYA] Not it... This isn't
it! This isn't the arm either.

160
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:09,458
[SAKUYA] Komaki... Sakurai?
Komaki Sakurai!

161
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,208
[maniacal laugh]

162
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,833
[KISARAGI] The Kozunu clan...
they summon demons, disturb the

163
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,791
Dragon Stream...
And beyond that,

164
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,416
the Eight-Hands-Breadth Sword...

165
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,875
With that and the disturbances
in the Dragon Stream...

166
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,500
It couldn't be...
the Bo-dhi-satt-va Eye?!

167
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,625
Um, so...
You made all this yourself?

168
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:45,291
Yeah, I got up early and
spent nine hours preparing it.

169
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,375
Sweet!

170
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,083
Hey! Get your
damn hands off the food!

171
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,166
Hey, you too Tatsuma.

172
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,958
[KYOICHI]
Hey, spread the love!

173
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,083
[YUUYA] The most important thing
is that Sakurai will like it.

174
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,750
Mmm...
It's better than I expected!

175
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,625
Hey hubby, lunches made by the
wives are always best.

176
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,541
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?!

177
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,458
[ANKO]
Well, now that looks good!

178
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,416
Hey, Komaki,
nice to see you again!

179
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,250
How've you been, Komaki?

180
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,500
Oh, hi guys. It's really
nice to see you! I was hoping

181
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,458
to get to see you guys here!

182
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,875
Good luck in the tournament,
Komaki.

183
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,791
Hey, who are they, Anko?

184
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,500
They're on the Yukimigahara
High School archery team.

185
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,125
Hinano Oribe and her
older sister, Yukino, who

186
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,500
specializes in the naginata.

187
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,125
[ANKO] Hinano and Komaki
are long-time rivals,

188
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,875
and their duels are always
the main attraction

189
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,583
to these tournaments. Plus,
the Oribe sisters are as smart

190
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,541
as they are pretty,
and they're quite popular

191
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,958
even at our school!

192
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,541
It'd be a total waste not
to do an article on them!

193
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,875
Who cares?

194
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,541
Hey, do you guys
want some of this?

195
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,791
No thanks, I've got other
stories that I need to cover

196
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:00,208
today, so I've gotta run but
you guys have a good time.

197
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,708
[KYOICHI]
Your loss.

198
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,708
Hey, you two want some of this!
This shit's good!

199
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,958
What did I do?

200
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,041
Don't scare my little sister!

201
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,416
Let's go.

202
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,458
Komaki, Number 2.

203
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,875
[SAKUYA]
Komaki...

204
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:38,333
No... No... No... No...

205
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,458
No, no, no, no!

206
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,625
No... No...

207
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,916
Komaki... Sakurai!

208
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,083
[clapping]

209
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,375
[MIKURIYA] Christ, you have
to feel really bad for all

210
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,041
the victims' families.

211
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,083
[OFFICIAL]
Who's that?

212
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,458
Huh? Looks like trouble...

213
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,166
[OFFICIAL] Hey,
there's a sign over there.

214
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,958
No one can be admitted
unless they're involved

215
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,625
with the tournament.

216
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,375
[sharp inhale]

217
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,291
[shrill screaming]

218
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,750
[all screaming]

219
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,833
It's the demons!

220
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,541
They just come
out whenever they want!

221
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,500
I will protect them!

222
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,458
[screaming]

223
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,208
[evil laughter]

224
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,958
You'll give it to
me, right, Sakurai?

225
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:13,041
You're a nice person...
You'll give it to me, won't you?

226
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,666
Gimme your arm!

227
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,125
[buzzing]

228
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,375
[AOI]
Komaki!

229
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,375
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

230
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,166
Komaki!

231
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,750
--My arm's broken...
--Let go!

232
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,416
--Give me this one!
--Damn it, let go!

233
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,375
[AOI] Komaki! Stop it!
Let go of her!

234
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,208
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

235
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:05,125
[KOMAKI] Aoi! Aoi!
You're bleeding...

236
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,333
Don't worry about me. Help her!

237
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,000
I told you don't let
emotions dictate your actions!

238
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,916
But...!

239
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Just keep your
ass there for now!

240
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,041
--Aoi!
--Kyoichi!

241
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,041
Take it easy! Aoi!

242
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,166
I got this!

243
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,666
[screams]

244
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,250
Hmm.

245
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,083
Tatsuma!

246
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,208
Go ahead! I'm okay.

247
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,041
[TENDO]
Who are you?!

248
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,375
It doesn't matter.
You'll still die!

249
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,708
Please let go,
Komaki!

250
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,375
--What's wrong?!
--I want to...

251
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:00,666
I want to... protect them!
I don't want anyone else to...

252
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,875
[KYOICHI] C'mon, let go!
You are one pushy bitch!

253
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,625
[KOMAKI]
Daigo!

254
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,208
I got it...

255
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,916
[bellows]

256
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,583
W-Whoa, not good!

257
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,458
[KYOICHI]
Aww, can't fly away?

258
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,958
Get ready to die, Bug Girl.

259
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,291
Don't do it!

260
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,833
[TENDO] Who are you?
Who the hell are you?

261
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,833
Thank goodness...

262
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,291
Again... I've been made a
fool of by Komaki Sakurai.

263
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,958
She's so innocent with The
Power. She crushes me again.

264
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,458
Nothing has changed since then.

265
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,416
[KOMAKI] What in the hell are
you talking about? You act as if

266
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,583
you know me or something.

267
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,625
[SAKUYA]
What? You don't remember?

268
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:57,041
[Sakuya chuckles]

269
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,333
[KOMAKI]
What?!

270
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,375
[SAKUYA] She says
she doesn't remember!

271
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,416
[laughing]

272
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,625
[KOMAKI]
Watch out, Aoi.

273
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,541
[AOI]
It's all right.

274
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,666
I don't know what horrible
things you've been through,

275
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,666
but what
you're doing won't help.

276
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,458
All this, won't help
make things right.

277
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,750
Please stop all this killing.
You don't have to do this!

278
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,208
Why can't you just become
friends with Komaki? I'll do

279
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,750
whatever I can to help you get
through this! So please stop,

280
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:30,916
all this killing.
Please! Please.

281
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,375
Give it back.

282
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:44,458
[SAKUYA] Give me my arm back.
Give it back... Give it back...

283
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,958
If I ever lost
the ability to draw my bow...

284
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,208
No!

285
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,875
[car alarm goes off]

286
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,666
Sakuya...

287
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,041
[YUUYA]
Sakurai!

288
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,958
I can't protect them...
I couldn't protect her...

289
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,416
I couldn't...
I couldn't...

290
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,916
We've practiced
really hard for this.

291
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,750
So let's go out
and try our best!

292
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,708
Sure.

293
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,416
So that we
don't have any regrets.

294
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,500
If I ever lost the
ability to draw my bow...

295
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,041
...then I might as well die!

296
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,125
You know how I feel!

297
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,750
I'm gonna do my
best and not lose!

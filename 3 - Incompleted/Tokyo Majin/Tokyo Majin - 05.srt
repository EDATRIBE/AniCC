00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:19,833
[sighs]

00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,125
[Woman screams]

3
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,125
[MOTHER]
Takeo! It's dinner time!

4
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:54,000
[desperate gasping]

5
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,458
[animalistic growl]

6
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,625
[scrapes]

7
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,875
[RAITO] If it's our fate,
I'll see you again.

8
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,583
[KYOICHI]
When it was all over,

9
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,833
we still didn't have a
real good idea what happened,

10
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,875
and Lightening Head
just disappeared.

11
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,666
[YUUYA] Can someone
explain to me how a human

12
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,916
can turn into
one of those demons?

13
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,333
Is it possible
that the other demons

14
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,000
we've fought have
all been the same?

15
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,833
It's not. This one
wasn't like them at all.

16
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,416
It was a human with
a Power, who had been

17
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,250
intentionally transformed
into something else.

18
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,958
Who or whatever did
this to him knew exactly

19
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,291
what they were doing.

20
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,833
My guess is that they
cast a spell on him

21
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,208
that intensified his
malice and hatred.

22
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,958
[KYOICHI] A spell...
Is that what the Dark Arts

23
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,041
are supposed to be?

24
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,791
But who on earth
would do such a thing?

25
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,041
[gasps]

26
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,625
It's that guy.

27
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,708
[KISARAGI] At any rate,
this is not to say that anyone

28
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,791
with the Power is going
transform into a demon.

29
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,708
It's more than likely that
the spell only works on people

30
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,208
who have darkness
in their hearts.

31
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,791
[YUUYA]
Darkness in their hearts, huh?

32
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,583
Is there anybody on
the planet who doesn't

33
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,791
fit that description?

34
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:49,916
But still... This is our
fight! So we have to win it.

35
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,500
We can't give up now.

36
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,750
And more importantly, we can't
forget our obligation to

37
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,166
protect the innocent
people that this creature

38
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,250
is preying upon
every single day.

39
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,333
[Girl in fire screaming]

40
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:12,250
[GIRL IN FIRE] Help me, Aoi!
Please! Help me! Aoi!

41
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,291
I want to save them all,
I want to save every person

42
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,500
I can.

43
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,000
Even the souls of
those who have become

44
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,208
those horrible demons.
I have to try.

45
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,833
I won't give up.
I'm going to fight.

46
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,416
[KYOICHI]
Madam President got my vote.

47
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,750
[KOMAKI]
Count me out.

48
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,208
Are all of you people out of
your freakin' minds or what?

49
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,291
You saw what that
thing was capable of!

50
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,125
This isn't a game. You guys are
gonna be fighting for real!

51
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,666
Don't you understand that?

52
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,333
C'mon, Aoi. If a demon has a
chance, it's going to kill you.

53
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,083
[KOMAKI] Let's stop playing
superhero and be normal again.

54
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:00,791
Can't we please just go back to
being high school students?

55
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,958
W'e've been waiting for the
summer break for a long time.

56
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,833
Remember how we talked
about hanging out by the pool

57
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,958
or the beach all summer long?

58
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,708
[AOI] Komaki... I understand
what you're saying, but this

59
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,291
"thing" has already started
whether we like it or not.

60
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,791
We're the only ones who
can do anything about it.

61
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,791
[KOMAKI] Of course, you're
always such a good Samaritan!

62
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,000
Is saving a bunch of strangers
really that important to you?

63
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,125
You don't even have the power to
do it all by yourself!

64
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,250
[KOMAKI] Tono's not the only one
having a rough time with this.

65
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:45,041
I... I can't handle all this.
It's too much! I hate you, Aoi!

66
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,041
[YUUYA]
Wait!

67
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,333
[light rainfall]

68
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,916
She'll be alright.
Komaki will understand.

69
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,583
[TATSUMA] So Anko's still locked
herself up in her house?

70
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,625
[DETECTIVE] The witnesses all
confirmed she said something.

71
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,500
Before she collapsed, they heard
her repeating the word 'dog.'

72
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,041
Think that she
could have dreamt it?

73
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,750
[MIKURIYA] She said 'dog' huh?
Sure have been a lot of strange

74
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,250
incidents occuring lately...

75
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,041
[STUDENT LEANING]
Hey, did you hear what happened?

76
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,625
[STUDENT WITH TIE]
Yeah... It got Takeo, too.

77
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,916
[STUDENT LEANING] Yeah. Guess
the curse is real after all.

78
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,833
Man, I'm in deep shit.

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,458
[NEWSCASTER]
And now in the news...

80
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,541
There have been a
series of bizarre incidents

81
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,416
throughout the
metropolitan area, in which

82
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,958
high school students have
collapsed into comatose states.

83
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,875
As of now, the police are not
ruling out any possibilities

84
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,583
while they continue
their investigation,

85
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,041
but there are still
many unanswered questions.

86
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,125
[KOMAKI]
Damn it...

87
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,375
[TALL ARCHER] Hey. Looks
like Sakurai's totally lost

88
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,208
her touch today!

89
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,708
[SHORT HAIRED ARCHER] Maybe
something happened to her

90
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,250
over vacation?

91
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,500
[BRUNETTE ARCHER] Do you think
she had a fight with Misato?

92
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,541
[TALL ARCHER]
Yeah, a lovers' quarrel.

93
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,875
[grunting]

94
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,541
[KYOICHI] For cryin' out loud,
it's summer vacation!

95
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,333
What's do you need to practice
your club stuff for?

96
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,750
I swear, I'll never understand
how you muscle-heads think.

97
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,750
Okay, what are you doing here?
Did you want something?

98
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,625
[KYOICHI] Have you been thinking
about what Kisaragi said

99
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,500
the other day?

100
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,625
You know, "darkness in their
hearts" stuff...

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,833
I'm sure you don't have
anything to worry about.

102
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:02,000
[KISARAGI] Mejiro,
Meao, Meguro, Meaka, Meki...

103
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,083
Five small Buddhist
shrines which try to seal

104
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,000
the demons away...

105
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,458
Lady Misato...

106
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,875
[ANKO'S MOM] I apologize,
but Kyoko says she doesn't

107
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,791
want to see you today.

108
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,375
[AOI]
I understand.

109
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,666
[cat meows]

110
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,625
[MAIKO] You like that,
little fella?

111
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,541
So it looks like somebody's
finally adopted you, huh?

112
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,166
What a lucky kitty.

113
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,000
[cat hisses]

114
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,625
[meows]

115
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,833
Is that...?

116
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,500
[barks]

117
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,000
[SAGAYA]
Aoi...

118
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,916
Now this is much more
interesting.

119
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,791
[ANKO'S MOM] Kyoko! She
keeps coming by every day

120
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,166
to say hi, the least
you can do is see her!

121
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,416
I'm sorry for the
way she's been acting.

122
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,583
[AOI] It's me, Anko. It's Aoi.
Look, I'm really sorry about

123
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,666
everything that
happened the other day.

124
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,750
I can understand what
you saw must've been really

125
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,750
frightening for you.

126
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:57,291
But, uh, don't worry
about all that stuff, okay?

127
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,583
Y'know, like Tatsuma
and Kyoichi flying around.

128
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,458
That's really no big
deal, see, there's a perfectly

129
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,708
reasonable explanation...
And you know Yuuya and Komaki

130
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,875
are normal people just like
you, they're like...

131
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,375
they're... so not normal...

132
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,958
Look. We won't put you through
anything like that again.

133
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,708
We'll do our best to
protect you no matter what,

134
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,208
so don't worry.

135
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,083
Don't worry, okay?

136
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,541
[AOI] The pool opens
tomorrow, and everyone's

137
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,708
looking forward to it since
we haven't seen each other

138
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:34,000
in a while, so... So
make sure you come, too, okay?

139
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,916
By the way, do you remember...
How you were on

140
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,375
Minami Middle Shool's
newspaper, and I went to

141
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,291
Kagura Middle School
and you interviewed me

142
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:49,125
for an article?
I was so excited about it!

143
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,416
Up until then, people
just saw me as an honor student.

144
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,125
That was all anyone
seemed to know about me,

145
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,416
and I felt so much pressure.

146
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,500
It was suffocating. But your
article really changed things

147
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,458
for me, and I've wanted
to be friends with you

148
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,541
ever since.
I mean that.

149
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,666
[crickets chirping]

150
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,583
[KISARAGI]
This one too... huh?

151
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:44,000
[phone ringing]

152
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,916
[AOI]
Hello, Misato residence.

153
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,083
Hisui?

154
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,958
[KISARAGI] I've got some
business I need to take care of.

155
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,333
It may be a while before
I'm able to contact you again.

156
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,208
Have there been
any new developments?

157
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,625
Uh, not, not really.
You don't sound like you're

158
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,625
in your shop now, Hisui.

159
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,416
[KISARAGI] There's a certain
rare vase I'm looking for,

160
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,666
so I'm making the rounds
at the area's antiques shops.

161
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,291
Another one of those requests
from Dad, huh?

162
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,291
Well, good luck finding it.
And you take care.

163
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,666
[SAGAYA]
Aoi.

164
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,833
[crowd cheering]

165
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,125
[KYOICHI] Hey. You're lookin'
kinda bummed today.

166
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,833
[TATSUMA]
Morning.

167
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:17,500
[KOMAKI] Listen, you two.
I'm sorry about before.

168
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,625
[TATSUMA] It's no big deal.
But I think...

169
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,041
[GIRL] Hey,
long time no see!

170
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,000
[GIRL'S FRIEND] Yeah! You go
anywhere over summer break?

171
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,333
[GIRL]
Is something wrong?

172
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:52,583
[MARIA] Speak, Spoke,
Speaking, Have spoken, Spoken,

173
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,166
Had spoken.

174
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,375
[KYOICHI] I can't believe we've
gotta take this summer school

175
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,416
on a nice day like this!

176
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,500
This sucks. What are you doing
in here, anyway, Tatsuma?

177
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,875
I am the teacher.
You are the student.

178
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,875
Do they even know how
lucky they are? It's not fair!

179
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,000
How come only the girls are
allowed to go swimmin' today?

180
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,041
I wanna go swimmin' too!

181
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,375
[MARIA]
I don't get it, Mr. Hiyu.

182
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,000
When we tested
you for placement here,

183
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,375
it looked like you should
be in the top of your class,

184
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,291
so what happened?

185
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,833
[light laugh]

186
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,708
[binder smack]

187
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,083
[TATSUMA]
Ow, that hurt.

188
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,708
Hey, guys,
check it out! Over there.

189
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,291
[HANNABATA]
Look, Captain, it's Sakurai.

190
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,750
[GIRL] Stop starin'
at us, ya pervert!

191
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,333
[GIRL'S FRIEND]
Dirty old man!

192
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,000
[girls chattering]

193
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,875
[AOI]
Hey, Anko!

194
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,666
[AOI]
Good to see you!

195
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,750
You'd rather be with her.
Is that it?

196
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,916
[KOMAKI] Answer me!
Who's more important to you,

197
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
me or Tono, huh?

198
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,041
[AOI]
Komaki...

199
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,291
[KOMAKI]
Aoi?

200
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,583
[SAGAYA] Hello, Aoi.
It's good to see you again.

201
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,833
[SAGAYA] Come.
Come with me.

202
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,416
Wha--?
Huh?

203
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,541
[MARIA]
Hey, get bac...

204
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,125
You are so gonna
fail this class!

205
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:16,208
[KOMAKI] Aoi... Aoi! What is it?
What's going on?! Aoi! Aoi!

206
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,083
What's wrong with her?

207
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,666
[KOMAKI]
Snap out of it!

208
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,458
--Somebody call an ambulance!
--What's wrong with you, Aoi?!

209
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:26,625
I might have guessed...
Hey. Horaiji.

210
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,833
Take her to Sakura-ga-o-ka
Central Hospital.

211
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,791
I'll take full responsibility.

212
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:36,208
What?! But that place...
Hey, how did you know

213
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,791
we needed your
help here, anyway?

214
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,166
This is no time to
stand around arguing, Horaiji!

215
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,416
We have to do something
to help her right now!

216
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,583
Quick, show us
where to take her.

217
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,833
Right...

218
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,375
Is she okay?!

219
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:19,208
[TATSUMA] You know I don't get a
good feeling from this place...

220
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,125
So figured it out, huh? See,
that's why I like you, Tatsuma.

221
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,875
What? Is there something
wrong with this place?

222
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,000
It just looks like
an ordinary hospital...

223
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,250
[KYOICHI] Personally,
I'd rather be anywhere

224
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,833
in the world but here.

225
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:30,875
That's cause
there's someone here

226
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,875
that I'm no
match for, period.

227
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,041
Hello!

228
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,250
There aren't even any patients
here, let alone doctors...

229
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,916
This place isn't
gonna stay open long!

230
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,708
[reverberating stomps]

231
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,500
What's that...
that sound?

232
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,958
[KYOICHI]
Here she comes.

233
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,958
[stomps increase in frequency]

234
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,791
Long time no see, Kyoichi?

235
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,166
I guess.

236
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,666
I heard from Inugami
a little while ago.

237
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,541
He let me know
you'd be stopping by.

238
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,750
[uneasy laugh]

239
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,333
Welcome everyone!

240
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,166
[MAIKO]
It's that girl!

241
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,375
Hey, Tendo. You look
like you're having fun?

242
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,750
[TENDO] Well, there's someone
I gave a new toy to, you see.

243
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:23,333
Now I'm curious to find out how
he's going to dance for us.

244
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,750
And this one, as well.

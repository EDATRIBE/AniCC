I found it! The
legendary magic lamp!

00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:56,567
How I've waited for this!

Speak any wish you desire
and I will grant it for you!

00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:06,608
My wish is for
countless new members

9
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,650
to join Iwatobi Swim Club!

10
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:14,025
Your wish is my command!

11
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:18,608
So! In conclusion.

12
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:21,775
[ALL] Iwatobi Swim Club
eagerly awaits your arrival!

[STUDENTS cheer]

14
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,650
I figured there'd
be more. Darn it.

We failed.

00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:37,608
What did we do wrong?!

17
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:39,983
Wha...? Yikes.

18
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,108
[REI] What an ominous dream.
Is it already morning?

19
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,817
[NAGISA]
Who you trying to fool?

20
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,400
That's not Iwatobi
Surprise bread,

21
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:50,775
it's just regular...

22
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:52,233
[REI]
Rise and shine.

23
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:54,317
I hate to disrupt REM sleep
but Haruka and the others

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,983
should be arriving soon.

25
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,317
--[REI] Hm?
--[phone vibrating]

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,942
[REI] Good morning, Makoto.
Are you close by?

27
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:02,775
[MAKOTO]
You sound wide awake.

28
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:05,317
We should be at your apartment
building in a little bit.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,108
I take it you're
both ready to go?

30
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:09,983
Are we? Never more ready!

31
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,192
Ready!

32
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:52,608
[MAKOTO] Hey, Rei. Which car
should I put this in?

33
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:55,233
[REI] You can set that
in Miss Amakata's vehicle.

34
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:56,733
You got it.

35
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,983
I'm gonna put this
one in Rin's car.

36
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,192
Great.

37
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:03,192
Whoa! Check out this
good looking car!

38
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:06,192
It's not mine. I borrowed it
from my mom for the day.

39
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,275
[NAGISA] Doesn't take away
from the coolness!

40
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:10,067
[REI]
Rin, Ms. Amakata.

41
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,442
Thanks for helping us out
this early in the morning.

42
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:15,900
It's my job as your faculty
advisor to be on time.

43
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:18,817
One of Confucius's
proverbs comes to mind.

44
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,567
"If I hear the Way
in the morning,

45
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,567
in the evening I'm
content to die."

46
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,733
Aw, yeah, I'm feelin' pumped!

00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:31,442
[RIN humming]

48
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,900
[NAGISA] Wow. You're a
responsible driver!

49
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,567
I wouldn't call it impressive.

50
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,858
Hah! You wanna talk technique?

51
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:41,192
I'd leave you in the
dust anytime, anywhere,

52
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:42,400
no matter the ride.

53
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,567
[HARUKA]
So prove it.

54
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,025
[MAKOTO]
Now, now.

55
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:47,150
Everyone knows you're both
excellent behind the wheel.

56
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,150
I saw first hand when
you drove through Tokyo

57
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:50,858
the other day, remember?

58
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,192
True.

59
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,817
Also, there were far more
cars on the road there

60
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,108
than there are here but
you're right, no big deal.

61
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,233
Now you've done it.

62
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:59,650
Hah! Think Tokyo's a challenge?

63
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,108
I'll be livin' in Sydney.

64
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:03,692
Lemme show you how
the Aussies do it, mate!

65
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:07,442
[AMAKATA]
Hey.

66
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:09,108
Look at Matsuoka hugging
the curve like that.

67
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:10,608
Pretty smooth!

69
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:16,192

equipment is rented!

70
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,983
Please be more careful!

71
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,108
I don't know what came over me!

72
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:23,608
Jeez, Rin, you sure bring out
people's competitive side.

73
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:37,067
[RIN]
Not a bad job.

74
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,442
You guys went all
out making these.

75
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,108
'Cause we're gonna be
projecting the video

00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:43,400
on stage during the
new student welcome!

pretty seriously.

What's up, Rei?

79
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:51,275
Huh? Nothing. I'm fine.

80
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:52,942
[NAGISA] You aren't worried
about your dream?

81
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,525
The one from last night?

82
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:56,317
[RIN]
Wait, what?

83
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,067
He had a dream that zero new
members joined the club.

84
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,192
Zero? You don't think that's
really gonna happen?

85
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,900
[REI]
No! What a ridiculous notion!

86
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:05,442
Dreams are illogical!

87
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,692
How could something
irrational be bothering me?

88
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:10,275
That in and of itself
is illogical!

89
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:15,317
[laughs]

90
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:20,233
[REI]
Let's get started!

91
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:22,817
First item on the agenda is
rehearsing the introduction

92
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,233
performance for the
Iwatobi Swim Club!

93
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:28,650
We open up with Rei doing
air swimming on stage,

94
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,733
showcasing the latissimus
dorsi with the butterfly.

95
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:34,483
Suddenly, out of nowhere,
a huge wave splashes in!

96
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,858
--[REI] Whoa!
--Splash!

97
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:39,692
Sending him into the world
of Arabian Nights!

98
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,650
At which point, cue the
movie we're filming today!

99
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,525
That's a pretty
elaborate performance.

100
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:47,692
One part live stage,
one part video.

101
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,608
Just the sort of bold and
aggressive production

102
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:51,483
our Swim Club needs.

103
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,067
[HARUKA]
Then we enter.

104
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,733
I'm playing a mysterious peddler

105
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:57,067
who guides our swimmer
through the desert.

106
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,983
I'm the evil king
who's after the lamp

107
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,692
for his own selfish reasons.

108
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:02,983
And yours truly will
be playing the genie

109
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,775
of the magic lamp!

110
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,317
[REI] Uh, we were originally
gonna cast Coach Sasabe

111
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,442
to be in the role, but there
was a scheduling conflict.

112
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,525
Don't you think Nagisa
is a little young to exude

113
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:15,483
the prestige needed for a genie?

114
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,525
You say that now, but look out!

115
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:20,233
Add a fake moustache! Voila!

116
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,483
[RIN]
Well, I'm sold.

117
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,317
Since you're already here,
why don't you make

118
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,275
a special appearance as the
evil king's loyal henchman!

119
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,692
We even have a costume
ready for you!

120
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:30,192
Not doin' the movie.

121
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,275
It'd look bad if someone
outside of Iwatobi

122
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,192
was in a video for the school.

123
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:35,692
[NAGISA]
Aw.

124
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,817
Plus, you know I only
agreed to help transport

125
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,067
your gear to the set.

126
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,692
You're not leaving when
you just got here?

127
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,358
I've got a meeting
with Ai to discuss

128
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,192
him taking over as swim captain.

129
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:48,317
Besides, once you finish up with
filming, the trains and buses

130
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,442
will be running,
so you'll get home fine.

131
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:53,400
[MAKOTO]
Thanks for helping out, Rin.

132
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:55,025
[REI] We couldn't have
gotten here without you.

133
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,692
We won't forget it.

134
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:58,442
No sweat.

135
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,233

One last thing!

136
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:05,233
You better come visit us!

137
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,817
[chuckles] You guys look
really good in those costumes.

138
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,233
Do your best and I'll
see you 'round, okay?

139
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:18,733
Quiet on the set!

140
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:21,400
Ready? Action!

[REI grunts]

142
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:28,317
[REI]
Wh... What happened?

143
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,067
It must have been
my butterfly stroke.

144
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,025
It was so magnificent,
nature grew jealous.

145
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:35,983
And sent a tidal wave to
bring me to this strange land.

146
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,233
Cruel fate!

147
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,317
[NAGISA]
Okay, cut!

148
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,317
He's a pretty good actor, huh?

149
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,817
Yeah, a perfect take.

150
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,942
Natural talent is what he's got!

151
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,108
He's doesn't hold back--

152
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,150
hard to believe he's
a newbie. However...

153
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,775
The lighting on his
skin needs something.

154
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:53,025
What?

155
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:55,650
I'm thinking more suntan
oil will do the trick.

Paired with the
silver reflector.

157
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:59,275
The reflector?

00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:00,650
[AMAKATA gasps]

159
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:01,983
Yeah!

00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,525
Isn't that what this round
thing is called, maybe?

161
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:07,650
As expected, Miss Amakata!

162
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:10,233
You have tirelessly studied
a list of technical terms

163
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,567
to help us make this into
a first rate production!

164
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,900
[AMAKATA]
Yeah! Sure!

165
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:17,192
[REI] Then we must meet that
level of professionalism

166
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:20,858
and have our most prefect acting
on full display for the camera!

167
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,150
[NAGISA]
But first,

168
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,775
Nagisa's gonna have
to put suntain oil on you.

169
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:26,525
You stay back!
I did it myself earlier!

170
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,192
That amount of oil
is in no way beautiful!

171
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,108
[NAGISA]
Stop struggling and hold still!

172
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:33,483
[REI] Too much will
diminish the beauty!

173
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:37,192
[NAGISA] Remember, it's
adding production value!

174
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,400
The next scene is
where I, Rei Ryugazaki,

175
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:42,317
wander through the strange
world of Arabian Nights.

176
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,108
Only to find that
my path crosses

177
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,900
with the mysterious
peddler, Haruka.

178
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:47,983
[MAKOTO muttering]
Within those bundles,

179
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,942
the mysterious peddler
carries a lamp.

180
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,317
[REI]
You all set?

181
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,275
We don't have much time,
so lets get this next shot.

182
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:56,525
Yes, I'm ready.

183
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,692
[NAGISA]
And action!

184
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:01,067
Who did you say you were?

185
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,275
[HARUKA]
I am a mysterious peddler.

186
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:06,067
I travel carrying
mysterious bundles.

187
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,108
While riding atop my
mysterious partner,

188
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,567
Chappy the Camel.

189
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,900
[NAGISA]
And cut!

190
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:14,858
Ah! Your acting has an
unexpectedly natural air!

191
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:17,358
[GOU] Up next on the schedule,
we shoot your scene, Makoto.

192
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:18,900
Uh-- Okay!

193
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,275
Wi-Within those bundles,

194
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,608
the mysterious peddler
carries a lamp.

195
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:25,817
A magic lamp that holds
a genie who grants wishes.

196
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,317
I must have the lamp,
no mander whaa...

197
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,608
[NAGISA]
Cut!

198
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:32,525
[MAKOTO]
I'm a terrible actor!

199
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:33,650
You can do this!

200
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,650
Just relax as you
deliver your lines!

201
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:36,983
Makoto.

202
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,525
When I'm nervous,
I think about mackerel.

203
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:41,650
[MAKOTO] H-How is that
supposed to help me?!

204
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,025
Fish should be the last thing
on an evil king's mind!

205
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:45,900
[NAGISA] Maybe he should think
about a pumpkin instead?

206
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,025
[REI]
Why a pumpkin?!

207
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:48,983
[NAGISA]
I'm just trying to collaborate.

208
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,358
[RIN]
All right, Ai. Let's start.

209
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:57,817
This meeting is to discuss
your transition to captain.

210
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,442
Okay! Where do you
think we should begin?

211
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,525
We definitely need
to revise the entire

212
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,567
first-year training regimen.

213
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,525
Will do.

214
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:07,817
[RIN]
Hm? What's this?

215
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,192
Oh. That's a Lucky Meal

216
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,942
and apparently they come
with a toy in each one.

217
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:14,525
The cashier said ordering
that was the better deal.

218
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,233
Looks like somethin' Momo
would fall in love with.

219
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:20,858
[laughs] It's true,
he probably would.

220
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:22,858
[gasps] Momo?

221
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:24,025
Sorry?

222
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:26,275
Oops! I thought you
were another person!

223
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:28,150
Hey, Asahi what's the problem?

224
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:30,900
No problem, be right back.

225
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,108
You still there?

226
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,775
[ASAHI]
Sorry about that.

227
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:37,067
Anyway, what are you doing
all the way over in Tokyo?

228
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,233
Didn't you get my message?
I said I'd be coming in March.

229
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,692
[KISUMI]
March? I don't think so.

230
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:45,567
As I recall, your message
clearly said May.

231
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,317
[ASAHI]
What, seriously?

232
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,442
Then I guess it was a typo.

233
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,983
I kinda suspected since
it was a pretty weird time

234
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:53,608
for you to be on a break.

235
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:54,942
Dammit, Kisumi!

236
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,733
Ugh! You mean you
knew it was a mistake

237
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:57,983
and never said anything?

238
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:58,900
[RESTAURANT CROWD]

239
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:00,192
I already bought
millet dumplings

240
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:02,317
and other souvenirs
for when I came to visit!

241
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:06,192
[NAGISA]
That was so delicious!

242
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,483
[MAKOTO] Wow, Miss A,
you even went to the trouble

243
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:11,483
of making lunches for us.
We can't thank you enough.

244
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:12,858
[AMAKATA]
No worries.

245
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,817
The one thing you can't
skimp out on during filming

246
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,400
is craft service for
the crew and actors.

247
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,358
The food was great,
but if only we we had

248
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:21,483
Gou's chocolate-flavored
protein rice balls,

249
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,567
this would have been
the perfect afternoon.

250
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,567
I was thinking of
making some but I didn't

251
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,192
have all the ingredients.

252
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:28,733
[MAKOTO, REI sigh]

253
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:31,525
[clears throat] Despite the
absence of chocolate rice balls,

254
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:34,317
lunch was fantastic and
we finished our shoot!

255
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,150
Once the edit's
complete and projected,

256
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:39,358
I'm sure the club will be
overflowing with new members!

257
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:43,692

[REI]
Nagisa. Gou.

259
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,275
There's still a lot of
work left to be done.

260
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:51,817
Let's put the finishing
touches on it

261
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,400
and recruit more students!

262
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,358
Team post-production!

263
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,108
[GOU, NAGISA]
Yeah!

264
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:02,108
[SASABE]
Take your marks.

265
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:06,317
[REI]
As long as I have this...

266
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:12,150
It is I, the genie
of the magic lamp!

267
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:15,983
Who has summoned me and
disturbed my slumber?

268
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:16,733
[REI grumbles]

269
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,150
You show off.

270
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,983
Your acting is pitch perfect.

271
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,900
And your portrayal of
the genie is commendable.

272
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:26,275
[laughs] The moustache
is doing the work.

273
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:30,983
Still. I can't help but feel
like something's missing.

274
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:33,733
Something I can't
put my finger on.

275
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:35,608
Yeah. You feel the same way?

276
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:36,900
Yes.

277
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,733
In terms of a self-produced
invitation video,

278
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,650
I don't think we could have
achieved greater success.

279
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,150
And yet...

280
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,608
It feels like there's an element
we're not fully conveying.

281
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,317
What could it be?

282
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:02,150
[yelps]

283
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:06,858
Huh?

284
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:14,983
No way!

285
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,692
[REI]
Hm. What are we missing?

286
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,483
What are we missing...?

287
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,817
You know what?

288
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,650
We could try asking Haru
and Mako what they think.

289
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:24,983
We could.

290
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:26,733
But we can't continue to
rely on the upperclassmen

291
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:28,400
to help us forever.

292
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:29,775
In order to prove ourselves,

293
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:32,317
we have to solve this
problem without their help.

294
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,067
Otherwise, after
they move to Toyko,

295
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,192
they'll be worrying if
leaving the club in our hands

296
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,567
was a mistake.

297
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,608
There's gotta be
a solution though.

298
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:42,275
[ASAHI] The most important
part is never giving up.

299
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:43,233
[gasps]

300
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,317
I know it's gonna sound cliché,

301
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,442
but no matter how remote
your chances are,

302
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,358
as long as a
possibility remains,

303
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,358
you've just gotta keep trying.

00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:52,775
[FRIEND A]
Hang on a sec.

305
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,525
So you're planning on
going to Tokyo right now?

306
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:56,400
[ASAHI] No, but I thought
I could at least drop off

307
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:58,108
the souvenirs at
his parents' house.

308
00:14:58,192 --> 00:14:59,442
[FRIEND B]
The dumplings?

309
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,608
[ASAHI] Shut up! They were
going to expire today!

310
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:05,983
I can't think
of anything good!

311
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,858
Yeah, same here.

312
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:10,608
[GOU]
Rei! Nagisa! Guess what!

313
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:11,858
[NAGISA]
What's up?

314
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:15,192
[GOU] I found something
amazing! Take a look!

315
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:16,858
It's an old Iwatobi Swim Club

316
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:19,067
new student
invitation guidebook!

317
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,067
And what makes this
so remarkable?

318
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,317
Okay, try not to be too shocked.

319
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,358
Earlier today, I checked
the history of the club

320
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,858
in the faculty room.

321
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:28,692
And you are never going
to believe how many

322
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:32,067
new students decided to join
the year it was established!

323
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,275
The most in history!
A total of 30!

324
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:37,400
[BOTH]
Thirty new members?!

325
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:39,567
[GOU] And inside it tells
how they made it happen!

326
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,067
[NAGISA]
Quick! Open it!

327
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:46,067
[NAGISA] What's going on
with the number four?

328
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,067
What's that about?

329
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,900
[GOU]
Right? Aren't you curious?

330
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:51,400
[NAGISA] Of course! Where's
the page explaining it?

331
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,025
[GOU]
Unfortunately...

332
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:55,817
That part is missing.

333
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,150
What? That's so unfair!

334
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,358
What good's saving
the book then?

335
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,233
Because the other
pages are intact,

336
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:04,483
so maybe we can still get
a record number of students...

337
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:07,275
The most important part
is never giving up.

338
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:10,025
Except the ice cream thing
does seem like bribery.

339
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:11,900
I don't think I'd complain!

340
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:14,275
[REI]
Then it's decided!

341
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:16,358
What an interesting
turn of events.

342
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,733
Quite obviously, the only
choice we have is to search

343
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:21,108
until we locate
that missing page!

344
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:22,775
Are you sure you wanna
spend time looking

345
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,400
for something you may not find?

346
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,942
Now while you might find
this to be bit cliché,

347
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:28,692
no matter how remote
your chances are,

348
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:30,567
as long as even a
possibility remains,

349
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,150
you've just gotta keep trying.

350
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:34,192
Agreed? Now who's with me?

351
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:39,900
[SASABE] Hm, afraid I'm at
a loss. I'm no spring chicken

352
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:42,317
but this was way
before even my time.

353
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,650
[NAGISA]
That is old.

354
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,483
However, I feel as though
I've heard about this

355
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,108
PKH business at some point.

356
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:49,358
[REI]
Do you remember where?

357
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,733
Nah. Not enough to be a help.

358
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:53,858
[GOU] Anything at all
would be amazing.

359
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:55,442
[SASABE]
Hm...

360
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:58,608
Hey, the equipment you ordered
finally arrived, Coach Sasabe.

361
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:01,400
[SASABE]
Terrific. I'll be right over.

362
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:04,442
If I remember anything,
I'll let you know ASAP.

363
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:05,567
Later!

364
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,192
[NAGISA] All caps.
It's gotta be an acronym.

365
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,942
[GOU]
PKH.

366
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,775
[NAGISA] Maybe it's some kinda
technical swimming term?

367
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,567
[GOU]
I've never heard of it.

368
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,692
Then another sport, like soccer?

369
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,817
Or related to baseball maybe?

370
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,900
[NAGISA, GOU groan]

371
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:23,317
We won't make
progress by guessing.

372
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,025
Tomorrow, the three of us will
conduct a thorough search.

373
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,150
We'll leave no stone
unturned and won't quit

374
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,358
until we recover
the missing page!

375
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:31,858
--Let's go!
--[GOU] Yeah!

376
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:34,442
[NAGISA] So, we'll start
by emptying everything

377
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:35,483
out of the clubroom!

378
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:36,900
[REI]
Sounds like a plan!

379
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:38,025
[NAGISA, GOU]
Yeah!

380
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,150
[NAGISA]
Nothing here either.

381
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:46,233
I don't know if
we'll ever find it.

382
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,858
[REI]
Those are the last two.

383
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,358
That's all that's left?

384
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:52,775
Except... There is one last
room we haven't checked yet.

385
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:53,733
Great news!

386
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:55,233
My optimism's restored!

387
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:56,233
[HARUKA]
You guys taking inventory?

388
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:57,233
[MAKOTO]
What's going on here?

389
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,858
[NAGISA]
It's kind of a long story.

390
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,567
[REI] We're currently on
the hunt for a misplaced item.

391
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,108
What are you both up to?

392
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:04,650
You know, just stopping by.

393
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,983
Is there anything we can
help you guys out with?

394
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,192
[REI]
Absolutely not!

395
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:10,192
It's nothing I would
ask the upperclassmen

396
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:11,275
to trouble themselves over!

397
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,400
[GOU]
Nagisa, Rei, look what I found!

398
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:16,317
Oh, hey, guys! You're
helping search, too?

399
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,192
You said you
found something out?

400
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:19,608
New developments!

401
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,483
When I took a look at the
old minutes, I figured out

402
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,483
that the Swim Club has
so many people who joined

403
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:26,025
that first year, they had to
operate out of a separate room

404
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:27,608
in the activities building!

405
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:28,483
[BOTH gasp]

406
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,192
It's there! We'll need a key!

407
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,192
I'm positive Miss Amakata
could provide us with one!

408
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:41,275
[AMAKATA] Apparently, this
clubroom hasn't been used

409
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:44,858
by anyone in over
ten years. So get ready.

410
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,525
It's turning.

411
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,983
[NAGISA]
So, Mako.

412
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,983
You feelin' worried about
the way Rei's been acting?

413
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,483
[MAKOTO]
Was it that obvious?

414
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:57,983
Ever since the filming,

415
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:00,525
Haru and I noticed
he's not his usual self.

416
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:04,525
So, we came by to
make sure he's okay.

417
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:05,817
I'm starting to get it.

418
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,608
He's on a mission to
find this missing page.

419
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,942
But typically, he'd view this
as a wild goose chase,

420
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,692
so something is bothering him.

421
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:15,108
It's crossed into obsession.

422
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:17,150
He thinks the dream
was some kind of warning

423
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,900
that if we don't get any
new members to join up,

424
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:21,817
then the Swim Club we went
through all the trouble

425
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,358
of reviving will be lost again.

426
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,483
But you got no reason
to be stressed out!

427
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,358
Gou and I are here
to help anyway we can.

428
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:35,108
[MAKOTO]
Well, all right.

429
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,858
No way.

430
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:40,150
You seem to have found a box
of former members' swim caps.

431
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:41,817
Why save those?

432
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,942
Look over here.

433
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:45,400
A training regimen
from way back when.

434
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:49,233
[REI]
Such a wealth of information.

435
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:51,817
Everyone was definitely
giving it their all.

436
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,983
They had over ten times
the members we have currently.

437
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,858
But I don't doubt each
was doing their best

438
00:19:57,942 --> 00:19:58,900
whether at practice,

439
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:01,317
or while competing
in tournaments.

440
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,775
[phone vibrates]

441
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:13,192
It's Coach Sasabe.

442
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:15,192
[SASABE]
Hey, great news! I remember!

443
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:17,900
The true meaning behind PKH!

444
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,108
Get ready for this.

445
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:21,483
P is for "Perfect,"
K is "Killer Muscle,"

446
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,483
and H for "Handsome."

447
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,192
Back in the day, there
was this hunky swimmer

448
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:27,067
named Azuma who
embodied the acronym.

449
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,608
He was the Swim Club's
secret weapon!

450
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:34,525
[GOU] Here we go.
This is the right year.

451
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:40,275
[BOTH gasp]

452
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:43,067
[REI]
I take it he's Azuma.

453
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,525
[GOU] To call his abs the
epitome of male physique

454
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:46,942
wouldn't be an exaggeration!

455
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:50,067
And suddenly, the PKH
plan becomes apparent.

456
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,317
Basically, a tactic to lure
a considerable amount

457
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,900
of new female members
into the club

458
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,442
by using this Azuma.

459
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:56,650
[GOU] Now that you
mention it, looks like

460
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,108
more than half the
members are female.

461
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:02,025
And they're wearing school
uniforms instead of swimsuits.

462
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:04,317
Were they all managers?

463
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,858
[NAGISA]
What?

464
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:09,650
Are you telling me that was
the secret meaning behind PKH?

465
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,775
I'm afraid it was
all for nothing.

466
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:14,692
Sorry, I'm going
to have to disagree.

467
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,400
I think the three of
you should implement

468
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,817
your own version of it.

469
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,400
Oh, yeah, I gotcha!

470
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:21,983
Like a PKH Rei variation!

471
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm standing right here!

472
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,650
[GOU] Mm... I dunno if I would
call Rei PKH material.

473
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:28,275
He's standing right here!

474
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:29,650
Listen everyone.

475
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:31,442
Since all the boxes are out
why don't we go ahead

476
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,358
and clean up the clubroom?

477
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:34,442
It's a little early,

478
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:36,358
but I say we scrub
the pool as well.

479
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:01,108
[sighs]

480
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:02,233
Uh--

481
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:03,108
What's wrong?

482
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:04,692
Nothing.

483
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:07,233
Merely reflecting back to when
I first joined the Swim Club.

484
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:08,692
That day,

485
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:11,275
after I watched you
swim so beautifully,

486
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:15,108
I wanted to move through the
water as freely as you did.

487
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:17,358
You're the whole reason
I joined the club.

488
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,775
Guess what? You already
are free, Rei.

489
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,317
[REI]
Yes!

490
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,900
[NAGISA]
Talk about nostalgic!

491
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:36,358
You found the little
mascots Haru carved!

492
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,317
[GOU]
I didn't know we had any left.

493
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,858
If you need more,
I have some at home.

494
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,108
[NAGISA]
For real?

495
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:44,775
Hey! Maybe we can pass
'em out this year, too!

496
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:46,983
What do you have there?

497
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,400
Oh. A cassette tape?

498
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:51,983
Yeah. What do you
say we take a look?

499
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,775
[GOU]
This takes me back!

500
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,775
Everyone was trying so hard.

501
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:59,525
This was from right before
the tournament, wasn't it?

502
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:02,983
I'm sure past Swim Club members
practiced equally hard.

503
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:06,358
And now here we are, keeping
that legacy alive and well.

504
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:14,317
[gasps] All these years later,
history repeats itself.

505
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,317
Nagisa!

506
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,692
Inspiration struck me
like a lightning bolt!

507
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:21,275
I believe I've discovered
the missing piece.

508
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,983
I know the final edit
we need to make

509
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,983
to the invitation video!

510
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:29,067
Let's finish it up
then. Can't wait!

511
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,192
And, why don't we hold a
private screening right after?

512
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:33,067
[REI]
Uh...

513
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,358
Inside the pool! Cool?

514
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:40,150
[NAGISA] It is I, the genie
of the magic lamp!

515
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:43,400
Who has summoned me and
disturbed my slumber?

516
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:45,817
[REI] What the mysterious
peddler said was true!

517
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,567
I can ask for anything!

518
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,608
Come now.

519
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:50,942
And tell me what
it is you wish for!

520
00:23:51,025 --> 00:23:54,025
I wish for many
new members to join!

521
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:55,442
In the past,

522
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:58,150
we were young and formed bonds
with the upperclassmen.

523
00:23:58,233 --> 00:23:59,983
Now we're the upperclassmen.

524
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:01,900
Looking to develop new ones.

525
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,400
Forging memories
with new friends.

526
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:11,358
[REI] I want those bonds to
continue. Forever and ever!

527
00:24:11,442 --> 00:24:13,775
Your wish is my command!

528
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:24,400
We decided we should add
the voiceover at the end.

529
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,483
I couldn't have
said it any better.

530
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,483
Agreed. Good job you guys.

531
00:24:30,858 --> 00:24:32,233
[MAKOTO]
Nagisa.

532
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:33,400
Rei.

533
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:34,608
Gou.

534
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:36,233
As long as the three
of you are here,

535
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:39,358
Iwatobi High School Swim Club
will be in good hands.

536
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:43,483
And Makoto and I can graduate
without any worries.

537
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,317
Leave everything to us!

538
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,442
[MAKOTO] Rei. I'm counting
on you as the captain.

539
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:50,900
Thanks.

540
00:24:50,983 --> 00:24:52,775
[laughs]

541
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,733
[NAGISA] Don't forget,
the live performance

542
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:56,025
is still yet to come!

543
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:58,358
[GOU] I already feel
myself getting nervous.

544
00:24:58,442 --> 00:24:59,483
[REI]
There's no point in stressing

545
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:00,817
before we're even on stage.

546
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,067
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, no worries!

547
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,650
[NAGISA]
That's just like you, Gou!

548
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:04,983
[GOU]
But what if a new member

549
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:08,150
with incredible muscles
joins? What'll I do?

550
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:09,900
[NAGISA]
Full on panic!

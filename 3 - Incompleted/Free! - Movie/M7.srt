1
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,900
[MAKOTO]
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:44,858
I wish I didn't have
to quit Swim Club.

3
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:46,442
[IKUYA]
It's not you fault.

4
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:49,400
You have to take care of your
little brother and sister.

5
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:52,358
[MAKOTO]
I do. Thanks, Ikuya.

6
00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:54,442
I hate how things turned out.

7
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,442
For the team to
break up like this,

8
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:58,358
and right before the tournament.

9
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:00,775
Between me and Asahi leaving...

10
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:04,233
And Haru... What really
happened to him anyway?

11
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:07,942
I thought we were close,
but now I'm starting to think,

12
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:09,858
maybe I'm never going
to understand him.

13
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:11,400
[gasps]

14
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,567
Makoto. I've made up my mind.

15
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,442
I'm going to America
with my brother.

16
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:19,733
[MAKOTO]
What?

17
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:23,608
[IKUYA] I wanna keep
swimming, and get faster.

18
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:25,942
I never thought I'd like
competing this much.

19
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,775
But I've fallen in love with it.

20
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,483
Ikuya.

21
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,775
[IKUYA] When you see Haru,
give him a message.

22
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:32,817
Tell him...

23
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,192
[REI]
The meeting will come to order.

24
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:55,733
I'd like to start off by
proposing the following.

25
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:57,358
Before Rin leaves for Australia,

26
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:59,358
we should throw him
a surprise party.

27
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:01,317
As you'll recall,
he gifted us a pool

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,775
full of cherry blossoms.

29
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:05,150
And we were all touched
by the gesture.

30
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:07,650
So in my personal view,
we should return this kindness

31
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,025
with a surprise of equal
or greater value.

32
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,358
However, bear in mind Haruka
and Makoto will be--

33
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,608
Gotta keep it short and sweet.

34
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:16,817
Anyway, who here at
this table has an idea

35
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,067
and wants to start our
brainstorming session?

36
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,483
[NAGISA]
I'll go first!

37
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,067
Picture this: fireworks
shooting off and exploding

38
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,025
the moment Rin dives
into the pool!

39
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,400
That exceeds well beyond
the club's budget.

40
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:29,358
What if the four of you
sneak into his room

41
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,358
and perform a
choreographed muscle dance

42
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:33,400
as he's waking up
in the morning?

43
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:35,900
Back up. What the heck
is a muscle dance?

44
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,442
Uh. I'm thinking we
should keep the surprise

45
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:40,150
centralized to the pool.

46
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:43,525
I gotcha, then we can carry Rin
to the pool while he's sleeping!

47
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:45,275
Then commence with
the muscle dance!

48
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,483
Zero dancing will be involved!

49
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:50,192
What do you think we
should do for him, Haru?

50
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,025
[HARUKA]
Give him a grilled mackerel.

51
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:54,525
And it turns out it's
cured in vinegar.

52
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,858
Then, surprise, it's actually...

53
00:03:58,275 --> 00:03:59,608
...Carpaccio.

54
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:01,608
I think we need
a little bit of fanfare!

55
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,692
In Haru's eyes, that is fanfare.

56
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:06,692
[MAKOTO laughs]
I'm starting to get hungry.

57
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:08,317
Why don't we break for lunch?

58
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,233
[GOU]
You got my vote.

59
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,525
[NAGISA]
I vote we order pizza!

60
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:16,733
On that day,
during the experiment,

61
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:19,442
a mouse slipped into the
matter transference device.

62
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,608
[alarm blaring]

63
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:25,233
[VERONICA] David. It doesn't
matter what form you've taken.

64
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:28,150
Our memories, our love
will never change!

65
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:32,150
[DAVID]
I'm sorry, Veronica. But...

66
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,608
[gasps]

67
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,817
[DAVID]
We can't.

68
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,108
Since you adore cats,
we can never be together!

69
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:44,067
[VERONICA]
David! Your face! No! No!

70
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,858
[DAVID]
Forgive me!

71
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:48,650
[RIN] Ugh. How David had
to give up his love.

72
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:49,900
And then Veronica,

73
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:52,692
knowing they couldn't
see each other anymore.

74
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,150
Do you need me to
bring you a tissue?

75
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:57,483
I'm not crying, Sosuke.

76
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:00,525
I'm gonna go use the restroom.

77
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:03,817
You should be allowed to
lose yourself in a movie.

78
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,192
There's no shame in it.

79
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:08,650
[RIN] Wha-- What part of
"not crying" don't you get?

80
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,608
[RIN]
Gou?

81
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
[RIN] That's funny, she
didn't mention anything

82
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:26,775
about goin' out today.

83
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,692
[MOMOTARO]
Honestly.

84
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,192
Being here,

85
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,942
at this place and getting
to eat a Lucky Meal with you,

86
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:36,358
um, what I'm saying is
it's a dream come true!

87
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:37,650
Momo?

88
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,650
[RIN]
Hold the phone.

89
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:45,442
Is this a date?!
My sister with <i>him</i> ?

90
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:49,067
[phone vibrates]

91
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,317
Hey, Sosuke. What's up?
Where are you right now?

92
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,775
Sorry, man. 'Fraid I got lost.

93
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:56,233
[RIN]
Surprise. Okay what do you see?

94
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:58,442
Are there any
landmarks around you?

95
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,233
Up ahead there's a sign
that's marked "South Exit."

96
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,858
That's the opposite direction
you were supposed to go!

97
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:05,192
No worries, just hang tight.

98
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,067
I'm gonna come
and find you, okay?

99
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,275
[SOSUKE]
Will do.

100
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,733
[NAGISA]
Sorry about the wait!

101
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:15,233
Despite being advertised
as a fast food restaurant,

102
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:16,525
the Super Deluxe Burger takes

103
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:18,442
a surprisingly long
time to cook.

104
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:19,858
[MOMOTARO]
What gives?

105
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:22,650
Who comes to eat here and
doesn't get a Lucky Meal?

106
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,192
Only Lucky Meals give you fries

107
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:25,858
and a toy with
your burger, y'know?

108
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:27,858
Think about it: fries <i>and</i> a toy!

109
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:30,483
And since Gou bought one,
too, they're the best!

110
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,858
[NITORI]
O-Okay. I get it.

111
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:33,608
Could you please dial it back?

112
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:35,192
I'm sorry to interrupt.

113
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,942
But do you think we
could get started?

114
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:39,983
[NITORI]
Right! Apologies! Yes! Go ahead!

115
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,525
[REI]
Actually, it's a crucial matter

116
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,067
that requires your assistance.

117
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,442
Oh, don't tell me
you're thinking

118
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,858
of trading Lucky Meal
toys with us?

119
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,483
[NAGISA]
Maybe next time we meet.

120
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,358
Cutting to the chase,
we're interested in throwing

121
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,150
Rin a surprise party
before he leaves

122
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:54,942
and returns to Australia
and we could use your help.

123
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:56,942
[NAGISA] 'Cause, you see,
we haven't been able to come up

124
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:59,108
with any good ideas on our own.

125
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:00,942
So we thought we'd ask
you two if perhaps

126
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,942
you had some insight into
what we should include

127
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:05,108
regarding the
decorations or food.

128
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,608
Sure, we'd definitely be
interested in helping out.

129
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,400
There was a welcome-slash-
send-off party

130
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:11,275
with the team at Samezuka
the other day,

131
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:13,567
but it wasn't a big
surprise or anything.

132
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,317
Don't surprises make you think
of like, stag beetles?

133
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,983
We should totally give Rin one!

134
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,108
He'd love that!
Man, I know I would.

135
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:22,275
I think there're laws in
place that would keep him

136
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,483
from bringing a stag
beetle into Australia.

137
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,858
That reminds me!

138
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:28,650
I brought along some
presents for everyone today!

139
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,192
An explanation is needed.

140
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:33,275
Stopping kidding around!

141
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:35,650
It's food for stag
beetles of course!

142
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:37,400
I brought one for
each of you guys.

143
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:38,650
How thoughtful of you.

144
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:41,233
Wow, thanks! This was
really unexpected!

145
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:43,317
[MOMOTARO]
Oh, and um, Gou.

146
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,233
I have a special value
size pack just for you!

147
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:48,983
Here! It's all yours!

148
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,733
Oh, that's terrific.

149
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,192
I'm so glad I came out today!

150
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,358
[RIN]
I'm home.

151
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:02,733
Oh, welcome back.
How was your day?

152
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,442
Um. Great.

153
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,525
And did you go anywhere today?

154
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:11,608
Me?

155
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,025
Uh, yeah, I had a sudden
meeting pop up

156
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,567
with Nagisa and Rei
earlier, but that's it.

157
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,525
Completely normal!

158
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:19,275
[RIN]
Meeting? About what?

159
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:22,108
Well. Too many things to list.

160
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:23,692
Why are you asking?

161
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:26,525
Uh, I, you know, was
just curious, but, uh,

162
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:29,942
since you're the one
who brought it up.

163
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,567
You're not hiding anything
from me, are you, Gou?

164
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,067
Huh? Why would I be hiding
something from you?

165
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,442
I mean, if I did,
it'd have to be important!

166
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:40,108
Come on. You're
acting so paranoid!

167
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:41,567
[MIYAKO]
Don't pry, Rin.

168
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,483
Why can't a girl
have her secrets?

169
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,775
Whatever she's up to
is her own business.

170
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,942
You make it sound like
I have a double life!

171
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,483
Nothing's going on, Mom!

172
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:50,942
[MIYAKO]
If you say so.

173
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:52,733
I am saying so.

174
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:57,317
[RIN]
No. T-Tree sap for stag beetles?

175
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,692
Then Gou and Momo really are...

176
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:01,400
[GOU]
Everything okay?

177
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:02,817
You don't look so hot.

178
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,733
I'm perfect.

179
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:05,775
[gulps]

180
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:09,608
[RIN]
Gou, are you and Momo--

181
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:13,567
I mean. No, what I'm
trying to say is, Momo...

182
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,650
"Most peaches and chestnuts
take three years,

183
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,983
Persimmons, eight."
Do you know that proverb?

184
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,400
Huh?

185
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,942
I mean, I've heard of it before,
but why bring that up?

186
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:23,983
Never mind. It's not important.

187
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,150
Later.

188
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,317
He's sure acting strange.

189
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,233
For real.

190
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:31,900
[RIN]
It's no good.

191
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:34,817
I couldn't bring myself
to ask her to her face.

192
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,775
Anyway. Gou's not a kid anymore.

193
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:39,108
It's not my place to tell her

194
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:42,858
who she should
or shouldn't date.

195
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:46,942
Still, it's hard to
believe. Of all people.

196
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:49,525
Are her and Momo
really a couple?

197
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:51,817
[MAKOTO]
Fill me in.

198
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,400
How'd your meeting
with the others go?

199
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:56,483
So good! Momo even gave us
tree sap food for beetles!

200
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,150
[MAKOTO]
What're you talking about?

201
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:00,275
And the rest of the time,
the weirdo talked endlessly

202
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:03,567
about his love for
Dangerous Ookuchin Hosoeson.

203
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,275
If it were me,
I'd be super stoked

204
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:07,442
to find a Dangerous
Ookuchin Hosoeson

205
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:09,108
waiting inside my lunch!

206
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,525
What's the appeal behind this

207
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,525
Dangerous Ookuchoo
whatcha-call-it?

208
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:14,025
Only that it's
a super rare toy

209
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,525
that comes with Lucky Meals!

210
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:16,900
Really?

211
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,900
If it's an ugly fish,
I'm pretty sure Rin got one

212
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,483
with his lunch the other day.

213
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:21,275
[RESTAURANT CROWD]

214
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:22,775
What?! Are you kidding me?

215
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:24,983
[REI] More curious,
Rin bought a Lucky Meal?

216
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,358
It was a recommendation
by the cashier.

217
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:29,358
Was he happy? Did it
work its magic on him?

218
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:30,817
Not especially.

219
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,442
Well if Rin doesn't
want it, do you think

220
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:33,900
he'd let me have his prize?

221
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:37,233
A Dangerous Ookuchin Hosoeson
is my life goal!

222
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:39,650
I promise to give
it a good home!

223
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:40,650
So they...

224
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,275
They were no help at all.

225
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,442
[GOU sighs]
Maybe we'll have better luck

226
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:47,233
if we try and
brainstorm with Sosuke.

227
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:50,775
[RIN]
What's the big deal?

228
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,900
I should just ask
him if it's true.

229
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:55,858
[MOMOTARO]
Hey, Rin! Glad I ran into you!

230
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:57,358
What's goin' on?

231
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:59,192
[RIN]
Oh, uh, hi, Momo.

232
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,483
There's something I've
been meaning to ask.

233
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:02,817
What a coincidence!

234
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,775
There's something I wanted
to talk to you about!

235
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:06,233
There is?

236
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:07,942
You bet!

237
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:11,608
Actually, to be honest,
it concerns something I want.

238
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:12,733
[RIN]
Something you want?

239
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,192
Then my suspicions were dead on.

240
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,400
It's true? Gou--

241
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,442
So she already
told you everything?

242
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:21,567
Well, no, not exactly,
but I pieced it together.

243
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,608
Wasn't too hard.

244
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,442
Then, please understand!

245
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,983
It's my life goal!
I need this, Rin!

246
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,525
I've never seen
you this serious.

247
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:32,108
So it's okay?

248
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,108
First off, it's not place to
say whether you can or can't,

249
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:37,025
so asking won't
make any difference.

250
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:37,983
And secondly--

251
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:39,442
If you can't make up your mind

252
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:41,483
then the two of us
will hafta race!

253
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,608
If I win, you're gonna
gimme my heart's desire!

254
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:47,025
[gasps]

255
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:49,233
Very well. If that's
how you feel.

256
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,150
Obviously, your passion
can only be settled one way.

257
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,608
If it's through a duel,

258
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:56,275
I gladly accept the
terms of your challenge!

259
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:59,233
Tomorrow night, at Iwatobi
Swim Club Returns, we race.

260
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,442
Be there!

261
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:02,150
Thank you! You don't
know how excited I am!

262
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,817
You're gonna lose,
but I won't let you down!

263
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,025
Yahoo!

264
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:09,733
No way. The gauntlet's thrown!

265
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:10,775
[UOZUMI]
What? Seriously?

266
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,442
[MINAMI]
I saw it with my own eyes!

267
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:14,067
Neither of 'em were joking!

268
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,400
A race against Rin with his
little sister on the line

269
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:17,858
is unbelievable!

270
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:20,608
But then Momo saying
"Give me my heart's desire?"

271
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:21,983
Yeah.

272
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:23,983
Guess if he wins, the guy's
gonna propose to her.

273
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:26,608
In high school and already
thinking about marriage.

274
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:29,983
Momotaro Mikoshiba is a
man who lives by passion.

275
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,900
[MIKOSHIBA]
Are you kidding me?

276
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,233
[MINAMI]
Uh, hi, hello, sir!

277
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:34,400
[UOZUMI]
Didn't see you there.

278
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:35,900
Doesn't the Spring Break
Training from Hell

279
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:37,108
start tomorrow?

280
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:38,525
I couldn't wait to see you guys,

281
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:41,942
so I came back early only
to find Momo's gone crazy?

282
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:44,525
How'd he end up like this?

283
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:45,650
I don't accept it!

284
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,233
And I won't allow it!

285
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:48,858
[MOMOTARO]
Even if you don't like the idea,

286
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,733
Rin said it was okay, so I
don't see what the problem is!

287
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:54,608
The problem is it's not enough
to win against Matsuoka!

288
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,858
You're trying to surpass
your older brother!

289
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,358
I think someone's
a little jealous

290
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,067
they didn't come up
with this plan first.

291
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,025
[MIKOSHIBA]
Stop acting like a child!

292
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:04,650
If Matsuoka says it okay,
then I won't stop the race.

293
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:05,900
But you should know
you're gonna have to

294
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,400
out swim me as well!

295
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:09,775
Beat you? Are you
outta your mind?

296
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:10,733
[MIKOSHIBA]
How do you expect to win

297
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:11,900
with that kinda attitude?

298
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:13,233
Huh?

299
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:15,275
Everything I've ever done
has been for your sake!

300
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:17,983
I'm always on your side!
This doesn't change that!

301
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:20,067
And in terms of a competition,

302
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,525
I view it as you and
me versus Matsuoka!

303
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:23,733
You do?

304
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:25,525
Did I just hear them
say they're teaming up

305
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:26,858
to race against Rin?

306
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:29,067
How did things get
to this point?

307
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,025
[MIKOSHIBA]
Take your marks!

308
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:37,317
[REI] Even though we're only
asking Sosuke for advice,

309
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,233
is it okay that we're showing
up without an appointment?

310
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:40,650
[NAGISA]
We're good! Plus,

311
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,525
I know for a fact he
isn't supposed to have

312
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:44,233
moved outta the dorms yet.

313
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:46,067
Hey, guys, what are the
two of you doin' here?

314
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,192
[NAGISA]
Nothing!

315
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:48,983
We, uh, came to ask
Sosuke for advice

316
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,608
regarding our, um,
training regime!

317
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:51,650
Yes! That's it!

318
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:52,983
[RIN]
Oh. Really?

319
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,317
[NAGISA] He wasn't
answering his cell phone

320
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,067
so we decided to just show up.

321
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,858
Do you happen to know
if he's around?

322
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:00,192
He said he was goin' over
to the hospital today.

323
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,358
But if it's about your training,

324
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:03,192
I'd be more than happy
to help you out.

325
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:08,025
[NITORI]
Emergency! It's bad! Really bad!

326
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,567
[REI]
Mikoshiba <i>and</i> Momotaro?

327
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,317
So both brothers are
teaming up against me.

328
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,942
[NITORI] What's going on
between you three?

329
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:17,692
Well, actually, a lot of stuff
has happened recently.

330
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,317
You are gonna accept their
challenge--you have to!

331
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,442
I'm going to.

332
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,025
Be logical about this!

333
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:25,483
Swimming solo against
two guarantees defeat!

334
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:26,608
You know he's right!

335
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:28,192
If it was just Momo
it'd be one thing,

336
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,483
but you're also
going head-to-head

337
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:30,900
with our old captain,

338
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:32,983
a college student with serious
training under his belt!

339
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:33,983
[NAGISA]
Doesn't matter!

340
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,442
You'd never run
from a challenge!

341
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,108
Even if the odds
are against you!

342
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:39,233
No. Of course
I'm gonna race 'em.

343
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:41,817
Then I propose you at least
follow the theory of contests.

344
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,442
And have the match
be equal odds.

345
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,067
Two teams, two swimmers.

346
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,608
Haru! He would totally
be on your team!

347
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:49,900
Look, this is personal matter
and the last thing I want

348
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:52,358
is for him to get wrapped up
in all this drama.

349
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:54,275
Could you clarify what
you mean by personal?

350
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:55,817
[RIN]
Uh, j-just forget about it!

351
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,567
But... I know that if I lose
this race, I'll never be able

352
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,983
to go back to Australia
with a clear conscience.

353
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,192
[NAGISA, REI gasp]

354
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,025
[GOU] I wonder if Nagisa
and Rei had any luck

355
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:06,525
talking to Sosuke.

356
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:07,817
If they did,
I'm sure they came up

357
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,150
with some good ideas.

358
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:12,900
[phone vibrates]

359
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:13,858
Nagisa?

360
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:15,025
Hey, we've got problems!

361
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:17,025
Ask Haru for a favor!

362
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:19,150
Check if he can swim
in Rin's match!

363
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,275
Huh? Rin's match?

364
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:22,858
[NAGISA] Yeah! 'Cause he
said if he lost the race,

365
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:25,608
he couldn't bring himself
to go to Australia anymore!

366
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:26,733
[MAKOTO]
What?

367
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:28,733
Anyway, if Haru's
there, just ask him!

368
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:29,608
This is serious!

369
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:31,275
Wait! Don't hang up the phone!

370
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,692
What's going on?

371
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:35,358
[MAKOTO]
Well, if I understand right,

372
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:36,983
Rin wants a match with you.

373
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,942
And if he doesn't win, he's
not going back to Australia.

374
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,483
You have to be joking.

375
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,942
Years of training, and he's
ready to quit just like that?

376
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:44,983
It can't be true!

377
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:47,650
He never mentioned
anything to me!

378
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:49,650
But... now that
I'm thinking back.

379
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,275
When we talked the other day,
he did say something weird.

380
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:52,983
[MAKOTO]
What?

381
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,817
Let's see. A proverb.

382
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,817
"Most peaches and chestnuts
take three years.

383
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,400
Persimmons, take eight."

384
00:15:58,483 --> 00:15:59,775
What do you think it could mean?

385
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,233
Maybe it's a code.

386
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:02,775
[MAKOTO] It takes peach
and chestnut trees

387
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:04,150
three years to bear fruit.

388
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,858
And persimmons take longer.

389
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,358
So, maybe what he was
getting at is this.

390
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:11,150
If you wanna succeed at
anything, it's gonna take time.

391
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:12,650
But, eight years?

392
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:15,275
Actually, from the time he
first started swimming to now,

393
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,567
it's been way longer than that!

394
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,817
Does he maybe think it's
taken him too long?

395
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,817
That he's less than a persimmon?

396
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,025
That big idiot.

397
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,025
Rin would never lose
to a persimmon, ever!

398
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,692
You can't give up!
Scratch the surprise party!

399
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:30,358
He needs our help! Now!

400
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:35,275
[phone vibrating]

401
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:36,608
Uh.

402
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:37,983
Haru?

403
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:43,983
Whatever's wrong,
it must be important.

404
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:48,858
When's the last time you
called me? So, what's up?

405
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,067
It's about the match.

406
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,942
I heard from Nagisa and Rei.

407
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:55,233
Those blabber mouths can't
keep anything confidential.

408
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:57,692
It's a personal problem,
which is why I explained to them

409
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:59,608
not to get you involved at all.

410
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:01,358
It's a personal problem?

411
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:04,067
Very. But, you shouldn't
worry about it.

412
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,358
[HARUKA]
How can you say that?

413
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,400
Huh?

414
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:09,275
How does this issue
not concern me?

415
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:11,900
I don't understand why
you're gettin' so worked up.

416
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:14,358
Don't tell me you
and Gou are also...

417
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:15,858
[HARUKA]
This isn't about Gou.

418
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:17,483
Don't change the subject.

419
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,608
[RIN]
That <i>is</i> the subject!

420
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:21,025
[HARUKA]
Listen.

421
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,733
The only reason I was able
to move towards the future

422
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:25,858
was because of you.
So what gives?

423
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:27,608
You just decided to put
your dreams on hold?

424
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:29,233
[RIN]
What?

425
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:30,817
How can you say you're
going to quit swimming

426
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,483
after all this time!

427
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,275
You are not less
than a persimmon!

428
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:37,233
[RIN] Whoa, I don't know what
we're talkin' about anymore!

429
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,900
I never said I was gonna
stop swimming, okay?

430
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:40,983
You're not quitting?

431
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,525
[RIN]
Are you insane?

432
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:45,483
Nagisa said Australia hinged on
winning a match against me.

433
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,275
And if you lost,
you weren't going back.

434
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,775
Where'd that come from?

435
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,775
Besides the race is me
versus Momo and his brother!

436
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,150
Can you even believe it?

437
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:56,567
And if the creep wins,
I have to give him Gou.

438
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,692
I didn't realize
they were a thing.

439
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,900
Neither did I, but I saw them.

440
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:02,358
They both met yesterday.

441
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:04,442
Looked like they were
on a lunch date.

442
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:05,317
[HARUKA]
Yesterday?

443
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,900
Yeah.

444
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:10,442
Over at the hamburger joint--
the one they built a year ago?

445
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:13,108
What you saw... wasn't a date.

446
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,067
[RIN] Seriously? You were
planning a surprise party?!

447
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,025
Yeah, and when Momotaro
challenged you,

448
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:20,858
I don't think it had anything
to do with your sister.

449
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,567
Bet he wants your
Dangerous Ookuchin Hosoeson

450
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,150
What the heck is that?
It doesn't matter.

451
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:28,233
The more important thing is,
do you think it was okay

452
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,192
for you to tell me
about the party?

453
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,358
Don't blame me if Gou
and the others get upset.

454
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:36,567
[laughs] I'm sure they won't.

455
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,108
Things could have gotten weird
if you hadn't called me.

456
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:40,317
And anyway,

457
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,067
I may know about the party,
but finding out

458
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,817
I get to swim with
you one last time

459
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,483
is a good enough surprise.

460
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,233
Are you sure about that?

461
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:48,692
Why wouldn't I be?

462
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:51,025
If those brothers are looking
for a real challenge,

463
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:53,192
I don't think we should
disappoint them.

464
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,150
[SASABE] All right, gents.
The rules are simple.

465
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:00,358
Two teams. Two
swimmers. Freestyle.

466
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:02,692
Everyone ready to get
this match started?

467
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,067
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

468
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,108
Thanks for racing
us today, you guys.

469
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:07,150
Absolutely!

470
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,150
How this came
together is bizarre,

471
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,983
but a race is still a race!

472
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,067
And when we win,

473
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,858
Dangerous Ookuchin
Hosoeson is mine!

474
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:16,067
[RIN]
Haru.

475
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,525
[gasps]

476
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:25,317
[MIKOSHIBA]
Hey, before we start,

477
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,692
I'm glad I have the opportunity
to swim with you again.

478
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:30,608
But I won't hold anything back.

479
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:32,817
Good, 'cause neither will I.

480
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,775
[laughs] That's what
I like to hear!

481
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,858
[SASABE]
Swimmers, get ready.

482
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:40,608
[SASABE]
Set.

483
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:42,650
[whistle blows]

484
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,733
[MOMOTARO]
Holy moly!

485
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:50,400
He's always been amazing,
but look at my brother go!

486
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:52,150
Yeah, I mean I know
he's giving it his all

487
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,108
on this short
distance, but still.

488
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,775
He's on a completely different
level from high school!

489
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:59,067
Look at Haru, though.
They're neck and neck!

490
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,608
[MOMOTARO]
Going in for the turn. Aw yeah!

491
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,608
[SASABE]
Haruka's right behind him!

492
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:08,608
[SASABE]
They're both exceptional,

493
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:11,275
but Mikoshiba's technique
really stands out.

494
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:15,567
He, he. You know me losing
to you isn't an option.

495
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,733
Heh. I'll let you
get a head start.

496
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:21,233
Just make sure no one comes up
from behind you and bites.

497
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:31,650
[MIKOSHIBA]
Go!

498
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,275
Rin!

499
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:44,525
[MIKOSHIBA] As usual, Matsuoka's
leg propulsion is on point.

500
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:47,025
But my brother's givin'
him quite a challenge.

501
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:51,150
He must really wanna win
that toy, am I right?

502
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,567
[SASABE]
Look at Rin go.

503
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,650
Totally focused.
Swimming with all his heart.

504
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,317
Just one glance
and anyone could tell

505
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,275
how much he loves the water.

506
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:05,025
[MIKOSHIBA]
Almost there, Momotaro!

507
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:06,900
[SASABE]
Twenty meters remain!

508
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,275
Yes!

509
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:21,775
Aw! Why are you so fast, Rin?

510
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,567
Your swimming has
come a long way.

511
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,692
[MOMOTARO, RIN gasp]

512
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,983
[MOMOTARO]
What? Who killed the lights?

513
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:30,358
[gasps]

514
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,608
[ALL cheer]
Surprise!

515
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:44,108
[laughs] I admit it, I didn't
see this one coming.

516
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:46,108
I'm surprised! You guys got me.

517
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:48,358
[laughs] Just
returning the favor.

518
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:51,442
In exchange for the
pool of cherry blossoms.

519
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:54,233
Your friends at Samezuka
helped us organize this, too.

520
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:56,983
What about me? No one
mentioned any party!

521
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,442
[UOZUMI] Yeah, 'bout that.
We thought you'd let it slip,

522
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,650
so we kinda didn't
tell you. Sorry.

523
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:02,942
Can you ever forgive us?

524
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,983
[MOMOTARO]
Look at all the animal floats!

525
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:08,025
You got us an otter!
And even a capybara?

526
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:09,483
You guys!

527
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,775
For some reason, I really
don't think he's gonna mind!

528
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:13,483
We planned it for
Rin and turns out

529
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,275
Momotaro's the most surprised.

530
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:17,108
Nagisa thought the
inclusion of balloons

531
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:18,650
would be a welcome addition.

532
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,192
So how do you like them?

533
00:22:20,275 --> 00:22:23,275
We all worked together last
night to get everything ready.

534
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:24,650
All of you?

535
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,400
It's cool if you need to cry.

536
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:27,442
If you stay in the pool,

537
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:29,983
no one will ever
notice your tears.

538
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,608
[RIN]
Idiots! Shut up, I never cry.

539
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:34,275
[AMAKATA]
I believe there's a saying.

540
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:35,900
One can only truly move forward

541
00:22:35,983 --> 00:22:38,692
when tears have
cleared their vision.

542
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,608
I've also got some
words of inspiration

543
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,942
for you to follow.

544
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:43,733
Have fun with
everything you've got!

545
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:45,400
[ALL]
Yeah!

546
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:00,483
[RIN]
Hey, Momo.

547
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:01,483
Huh?

548
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,442
Take care of this
for me, will ya?

549
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:11,192
[gasps] I can keep him?
Even though I lost?

550
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:12,608
Consider it a parting gift.

551
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,192
[MOMOTARO]
Yahoo!

552
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:17,317
[laughs] Out of everyone here,
Momo sounds the most excited.

553
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,483
You can't blame him.

554
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,817
He didn't know to
expect this either!

555
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,067
[REI] You'll be departing
for Australia next week?

556
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,775
Want us to come see you off?

557
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:25,942
[RIN]
Nah, you don't have to.

558
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:27,442
Setting off on a
journey is something

559
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:28,775
that should be done solo.

560
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:30,983
How is it possible for
one person to be so cool?

561
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,692
The guy's got
poetry in his blood!

562
00:23:32,775 --> 00:23:34,317
[RIN]
Give it a rest.

563
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,942
[RIN] You know, it's gonna
be a while before we can

564
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:07,400
all hang out like this again.

565
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:08,275
That's true.

566
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:09,525
[RIN]
I gotta be honest.

567
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:11,983
Being able to spend this
last month with you.

568
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,775
I wouldn't trade
it for anything.

569
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:17,650
Looking forward to the
next time we can do it.

570
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:19,275
You bet.

571
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,442
[MOMOTARO] Let's get this
party fired up again!

572
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:22,858
[RIN]
Agreed!

573
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:35,942
[HIYORI] Seriosuly?
That's all you're gonna eat?

574
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:37,608
[IKUYA] And you're eating
too much, as usual.

575
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:40,650
You forget we've got time trials
as soon as college starts.

576
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:43,650
[laughs] Diligent
as always, Ikuya.

577
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:45,983
Yeah, well I suppose
one of us has to be.

578
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:48,650
[HIYORI]
Come on. I know you're excited.

579
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:50,817
We're gonna have a lot
of tournaments comin' up.

580
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,775
They'll give us a better idea
of who'll be competing

581
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:56,400
at the world level
after next year.

582
00:25:56,483 --> 00:25:58,775
Look. Here's a picture of you.

583
00:25:58,858 --> 00:25:59,900
[IKUYA]
I don't care.

584
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:02,650
As long as I can swim
the way I want.

585
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,817
Okay. Anyway.

586
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,233
I'm looking forward
to the future.

587
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,733
[HIYORI] But in the meantime,
I have to do my best.

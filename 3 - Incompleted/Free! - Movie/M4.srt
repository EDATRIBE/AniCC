00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,233
[MAKOTO humming]

2
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,317
[MAKOTO]
Breakfast is ready, Haru.

3
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:38,067
[HARUKA]
'Kay.

4
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,608
Not hungry? It's gonna get cold.

5
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:42,108
[HARUKA]
You're right.

6
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:43,233
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

7
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,525
[MAKOTO]
Haru?

8
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:49,233
[MAKOTO]
Wait! Where're you...?

9
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:54,358
[gasps]

10
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:07,400
Stop! Don't go! Haru!

11
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:09,025
[MAKOTO yelps]

12
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,608
[gasps]

13
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:17,692
[sighs] Crazy dream.

14
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:22,858
You all right, Makoto?

15
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:24,025
Let's go.

16
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:25,400
Uh--

17
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:32,567
Just dozed off. Thanks, Haruka.

18
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,858
There you go again.
Don't call me that.

19
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,108
Now let's see...
Which way's our train?

20
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:42,483
Got it!

21
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:45,817
Well, all that's left is
finding you a place to live.

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,275
Yeah.

23
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:28,275
[RIN]
What?

24
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:29,775
You're kidding. You mean
Haru still hasn't

25
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:32,317
got an apartment
lined up in Tokyo?

26
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,483
[NAGISA]
'Fraid not.

27
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,400
Mako found one right
after the University

28
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,233
told him he was accepted.

29
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,067
[RIN] And just decided
to keep Haru company

30
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,817
while he went
apartment hunting, huh?

31
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,942
Kinda.

32
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:43,025
Except that he said
he had to pick up

33
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:45,358
the key to his place anyway.

34
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,525
Hey, Rin, do you think
you're gonna have some time

35
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,317
to spare to help us
with the Swim Club's video?

36
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,108
Oh. Hey. You're
there, too, Gou?

37
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,275
Did you say Gou?!

38
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:55,692
Yeah, plus one more.

39
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:57,317
The three of us are
preparing to head over

40
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,817
to Iwatobi for the
Swim Club's spring practice.

41
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,150
Quick question, Gou--

42
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,733
do like praying mantises
or giant water bugs more?

43
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:04,983
[REI]
What? Praying mantises?

44
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:05,858
Uh--!

45
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:06,858
[RIN]
You've had your fun.

46
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:08,192
Be a good boy and
give me back...

47
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:10,692
[MOMOTARO]
Why are you so stingy, Rin?

48
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:13,817
So, first off, yeah,
I can work on the video.

49
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,942
But I have a meeting with Ai

50
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,108
so I can only help
out for one day.

51
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:19,192
[REI]
That would mean a lot!

52
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:20,858
Also, when you talk to Haru,

53
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:22,567
remind him that he
needs somewhere to sleep

54
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,692
so he better bite the bullet
and settle on a place soon.

55
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:27,233
That's some big talk
from the guy

56
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:30,150
who can't even fall asleep
without his own pillow!

57
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:31,650
[sighs]

58
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,692
Starting tomorrow, you're
switching up Momo's regimen.

59
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,650
Number 33 Training from Hell.

60
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,442
[BOTH gasp]

61
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:41,567
You don't mean the workout
my brother created?

62
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,025
No. Anything but that!

63
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:44,733
[RIN]
Too late!

64
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,358
Whoa, sounds like
Momo and the others

65
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:47,442
are training hard!

66
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:48,900
Right.

67
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:50,317
Guess that means we'll have
to train even harder then!

68
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,067
Yeah! I'm pumped to test
out Gou's new regimen!

69
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,358
Let's get started already!

70
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:55,442
[REI]
I concur!

71
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,900
I've been wanting
to focus on drills

72
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:58,317
that will increase
the speed of my turn.

73
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,900
[GOU] I wonder what Haruka
and Makoto are up to.

74
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:02,775
They should have
reached Tokyo by now.

75
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:07,608
[MAKOTO] I know graduation
wasn't really that long ago,

76
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,150
but doesn't it feel
like we've both

77
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,608
come pretty far since then?

78
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:13,733
Nah, Tokyo isn't that far away.

79
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:17,192
[chuckles] Not if you're
comparing it to Australia.

80
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:22,108
[MAKOTO] Rin. He's trying
to go even further.

81
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,275
[HARUKA] I need to hurry.
Find a place to live.

82
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:30,483
Yeah.

83
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:31,983
For sure, and since our
bus home's tomorrow,

84
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,025
we've got just one day, huh?

85
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:35,192
Yeah.

86
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,733
[SASABE] Oh. There's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

87
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:44,025
He'll end up finding
a great place.

88
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:45,942
Seeing how yours truly
set him up with

89
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,650
one of the best
realtors in Tokyo,

90
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,233
what could possibly go wrong?

91
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:51,108
That was nice of
you to do, Coach.

92
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,150
Miss Amakata, I'm sure
you have great depth

93
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:55,358
of knowledge when it
comes to Tokyo as well.

94
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:56,108
Me?

95
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:57,400
[NAGISA]
Oh, yeah.

96
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,483
You used to work for
a swimsuit manufacturer

97
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,233
in the city, right?

98
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,608
Well, that is true but...

99
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:05,650
Then I imagine you have
several wonderful memories

100
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,108
of your time spent there.

101
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:09,900
Yes. I do.

102
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:12,150
If I were to distill
them into a saying,

103
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:16,108
it'd be "Reality is often
different from reputation."

104
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:20,108
A parched city.
A concrete jungle.

105
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:21,775
The city is weeping.

106
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:24,025
And one day, even those
tears will dry out

107
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,900
in the Tokyo desert.

108
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,567
[REI] I thought you agreed
they were wonderful memories!

109
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,942
[GOU]
So, uh, anyway, Coach Sasabe,

110
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,817
how do you know a realtor
currently working in Tokyo?

111
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,025
Uh, actually, it's not someone
I've formally met before.

112
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,108
They just happen to be
a relative of someone

113
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,858
from the Swim Club
that also works

114
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,317
in apartment real estate.

115
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,483
[LITTLE GIRL A]
Good morning!

116
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,317
Huh?

117
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,608
Morning, kids!

118
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,525
Hey! And speak of the devil!

119
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:52,358
How's it goin' Hayato?

120
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:53,525
[giggles]

121
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,567
[MAKOTO]
This looks like the place.

122
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,192
Wonder what Kisumi's
uncle is like.

123
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:01,025
If they're twins,
we're going home.

124
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:02,358
Sir, could you help us?

125
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:03,358
Maybe so.

126
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:04,233
They are twins!

127
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:05,983
Back home it is.

128
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,442
[MAKOTO]
Not so fast!

129
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:09,192
[laughs]

130
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,567
Hey, guys! I missed you, too.

131
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,317
Kisumi! What're you
doin' working here?

132
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
[HARUKA]
Yep. Definitely going.

133
00:07:15,483 --> 00:07:17,858
[MAKOTO]
Hold up a minute, Haru!

134
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:19,650
[KISUMI]
Guess I forgot to mention it.

135
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:20,900
Which part?

136
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,775
Well, that I'll be going
to college here in Tokyo

137
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,775
in the spring, and
staying with my uncle.

138
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,067
Makes sense, you know?

139
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,692
All my stuff should be
arriving sometime today.

140
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:30,192
That's great to hear!

141
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,692
Customers!

142
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,192
You must be the
Haruka and Makoto.

143
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,442
I've heard so much
about you two!

144
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,108
Allow me to welcome
you both to Tokyo!

145
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:39,483
The city where love
and lust intertwine.

146
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:40,858
And to Shigino Realty.

147
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:43,567
where dreams and
ambition do the same.

148
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,067
This is my Uncle Katsumi.

149
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,817
U-Uh, hello.

150
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,775
I set some places
aside just for you,

151
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:51,525
so no need to worry.
So what do ya say, Kisumi?

152
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:52,900
You wanna play realtor?

153
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:53,692
Okay!

154
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,317
[BOTH laugh]

155
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,775
[chuckles nervously]

156
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,858
Got your license and everything.

157
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,233
Same as you, right?

158
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,775
All my time was eaten up
with entrance exams.

159
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:09,400
But, Haru, you got
yours already, yeah?

160
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:10,567
Uh-huh.

161
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,358
[laughs] Plenty of time
to get a license.

162
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:15,067
But you wait to
find an apartment.

163
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,817
Why am I not surprised?

164
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,733
[HARUKA]
Just drive.

165
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:19,733
[KISUMI]
Up ahead! On the right.

166
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:22,775
Here's the first place
I'm supposed to show you.

167
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,150
It's slightly old,
but in great condition,

168
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27,775
right by the station
and rent's a steal.

169
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:29,817
So, verdict?

170
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:35,733
The tub is small.

171
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:37,858
A three-in-one bathroom
has its tradeoffs.

172
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:40,525
Unfortunately, a small tub
is kind of a deal breaker.

173
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:42,233
[KISUMI]
Hm. How about this place?

174
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:44,567
It's a little bit further
from the station.

175
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,442
But practically brand new.

176
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,567
[MAKOTO] The bathroom's
got plenty of space.

177
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,525
Pretty nice apartment,
right, Haru?

178
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,650
[KISUMI] And it comes
with a modern kitchen.

179
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,733
The latest induction
technology. No gas burners.

180
00:08:57,817 --> 00:08:59,358
What if I wanna grill mackerel?

181
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:02,358
Huh? You can still
grill on this.

182
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,233
[KISUMI huffs]
Option number three!

183
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:08,858
[gasps] Spacious. Clean.
And a great view of the city!

184
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,858
Tons of natural lighting
and the kitchen

185
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:13,608
comes with a dishwasher
and gas grill.

186
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,442
The bathtub has
a reheating function,

187
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:16,983
and all for this price!

188
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,400
What a deal!

189
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:20,733
So why is the rent so cheap?

190
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,900
It's... a psychologically
defective property.

191
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:29,108
[gasps] Psychologically
defective? You mean it's...

192
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:30,192
'Fraid so.

193
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:31,983
This apartment's history
is kinda sordid.

194
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:33,108
[MAKOTO yelps]

195
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:34,275
[KISUMI]
Actually, last month,

196
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:35,483
the person who
used to live here...

197
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:37,400
[MAKOTO] I don't wanna
know what happened!

198
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,275
No way you're living here!

199
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:40,650
You're superstitious.

200
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:41,733
Am not!

201
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,108
But do you really wanna
risk a haunting?

202
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,692
[KISUMI]
Seriously, what's the big deal?

203
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,817
Haru will be the one renting it.

204
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,192
I know.

205
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:51,483
But I'll be creeped out
every time I come to visit.

206
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,858
[laughs] The two of you
are inseperable, huh?

207
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:57,025
We're friends. Deal with it.

208
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,733
[KISUMI] Hm. You're a pretty
particular guy, aren't you?

209
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,150
I bet the only thing
he mentioned to you

210
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,233
was the price range
and the train line.

211
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,025
Uncle Katsumi gave 100 percent

212
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,858
trying to find a good
property for you.

213
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,233
I appreciate the effort.

214
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:14,275
So that uncle of yours
really seems like

215
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:15,900
a lighthearted kind of guy.

216
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,233
Heh. You bet!

217
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,650
Get us together,
and it's nonstop joking.

218
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,733
--Kiss me!
--[KISUMI] Catch me!

219
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:23,775
[KISUMI] It's hard to
tell us apart, right?

220
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:25,650
Even our names are a lot alike.

221
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,983
Getting back to business.

222
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,483
I've got one final
property to show you.

223
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:31,900
What do you think?

224
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,525
The bathroom comes with
a full-sized tub.

225
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:39,192
Not to mention a gas
stovetop in the kitchen.

226
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:40,858
I won't know till I see it.

227
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:41,858
[KISUMI]
One small catch.

228
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,775
We can't go inside the unit yet.

229
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:45,233
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

230
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:46,692
Everything should be moved
outta the apartment by now,

231
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:48,900
but we haven't received the
key back from the tenant.

232
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:52,233
[phone vibrates]

233
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,650
It's Uncle Katsumi.

234
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,775
What? Already?

235
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:56,692
I gotta run!

236
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,442
He said my moving truck arrived!

237
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,108
They were supposed to
show up this evening.

238
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,400
Man, they're way
ahead of schedule.

239
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:03,817
Don't worry. I'll take
care of the check.

240
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,358
That way you two
don't have to rush.

241
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:07,608
[MAKOTO]
You sure?

242
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:09,525
I'm helping with work
so it's no problem.

243
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:12,067
I can expense it. Later!

244
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,400
He can expense it.

245
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,317
Kisumi's matured since
he moved out here,

246
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
like he's always
belonged in Toyko.

247
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:23,442
Hopefully we'll be able
to fit in as easily.

248
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,442
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

249
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:31,483
[GOU]
Take your marks!

250
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,442
What do you wanna do now?

251
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:37,108
Check out the unit
even if we can't go in.

252
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:39,275
Well, then let's head over.

253
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:42,150
The neighborhood's just as
important as the apartment.

254
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:23,900
[phone vibrates]

255
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:24,900
[NAGISA]
Give me an update.

256
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,275
How's the apartment hunting?

257
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:29,275
Afraid the search continues.
How are things there?

258
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:31,192
Great. Rin said he
could help us, you know,

259
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:32,775
with shooting the
invitation video.

260
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:34,900
[MAKOTO]
Really? That's terrific news.

261
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:36,275
And how's practice going?

262
00:12:36,358 --> 00:12:37,775
[NAGISA]
Bet you wish you were here.

263
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,608
We just finished up
at Iwatobi Swim Club

264
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,483
trying out the new
training regimen.

265
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,983
And now we're having
a meeting at the beach

266
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,858
and eating lunch.

267
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:46,067
A meeting?

268
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,483
[NAGISA] We're trying
to decide what to do

269
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,567
at the New Student Welcome
thing coming up in April.

270
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,275
So, remember how
last year our deal

271
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:55,192
was showing off each
members' best muscles?

272
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,900
On that occasion,
the muscles ended up

273
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:59,317
dominating the presentation,
but this year,

274
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,983
we're gonna take a
different approach.

275
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,400
We're planning to
showcase this year's

276
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,650
trendiest muscle,
the latissimus dorsi,

277
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,858
with its best move, the
butterfly! Live on stage!

278
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:11,733
Someone's gonna swim the
butterfly across a wooden floor?

279
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:12,858
[GOU]
That's the thing! We're gonna--

280
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:15,108
Sorry, Gou! Our
train's pulling up!

281
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:16,775
[GOU] It'll probably be
easier if I just send you

282
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:18,067
the video we shot.

283
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,067
[REI] Tell Haru good
luck finding a place.

284
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,775
By the way, based on the theory
of securing an apartment--

285
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:24,192
Nagisa, wait!

286
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:26,483
[NAGISA] I'll check back later.
Tell Haru we said hi!

287
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,025
Sure. Bye.

288
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:34,900
That is smart.

289
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:36,483
You can totally see
the butterfly stroke

290
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,358
without needing water.

291
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,067
[REI yelps]

292
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,733
[MAKOTO laughs]

293
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,275
You guys. At least you're
trying your best.

294
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,983
[laughs]

295
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:52,317
[MAKOTO] Let's do the same.
And try our best, too.

296
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,858
Looks like it's about
a ten minute walk from here,

297
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:06,108
so, this way?

298
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:07,358
That looks right.

299
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,358
Wow.

300
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:17,317
It's in a gorgeous part
of town, don't you think?

301
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,567
[HARUKA]
Mm-hm.

302
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:24,775
[MAKOTO gasps]
Hey, look, that's the place!

303
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:26,608
[HARUKA]
I think so.

304
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:29,233
[MAKOTO] Good thing it wasn't
that difficult to find.

305
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:32,608
[MAKOTO] Is it just me or does
this park look like the one

306
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:35,233
by Iwatobi Elementary School?

307
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:36,192
[HARUKA]
You mean where you fell off

308
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,817
the monkey bars in kindergarten?

309
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,358
[MAKOTO laughs]
Yeah! Right? That park!

310
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:46,358
[HARUKA]
Here we are.

311
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:47,733
[MAKOTO]
No nameplate.

312
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:50,358
But Kisumi did say they
were pretty much moved out.

313
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,692
Doesn't that building
look a little like...

314
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:57,692
[HARUKA]
Yeah. A natatorium.

315
00:14:57,775 --> 00:15:00,567
Think about it, a pool
that close to you!

316
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,358
You couldn't find
a more perfect spot.

317
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:05,192
If this place worked
out, you could swim

318
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:08,025
whenever you wanted to,
no obstructions!

319
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,650
Yeah, but, there's the
university pool, too.

320
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:13,858
[MISAKI]
Hey!

321
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:16,442
[MISAKI]
I saw you two.

322
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:18,650
You wanted to get into
this room didn't you?

323
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,358
Well, more like...

324
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,567
Out with it!

325
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,650
Are you friends
with Coach or not?

326
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:26,900
[MAKOTO]
"Coach"?

327
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,983
[NITORI sighs]

328
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,358
[door clicks]

329
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:39,067
Hey, looks like you're
almost finished packing.

330
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,608
And what about you?

331
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:43,067
I don't think you've
even started, have you?

332
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,275
[SOSUKE]
I actually plan on spending

333
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:46,233
a little more time here.

334
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:47,733
That reminds me.

335
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:49,483
Didn't you say you're moving
back to your family's house

336
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,608
before heading
over to Australia?

337
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:54,608
Yeah. Guess I have to be the
good son once in a while.

338
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,692
Aw, man, I wish I could
move into your house!

339
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,275
Also, I've been
dyin' to ask you--

340
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,775
whenever you go home,
who gets the top?

341
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:03,233
Is it you or Gou?

342
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:04,942
What're you talkin' about?

343
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:06,358
Don't play dumb!

344
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:09,483
I'm talkin' about the
whole bunk bed situation!

345
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,442
You know, top and bottom!

346
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,650
We don't have bunk beds.
We're not kids.

347
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,192
[MOMOTARO]
Are you kidding?

348
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,400
Not again!

349
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:18,150
Stop sneaking books
on how to raise beetles

350
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,525
into Rin's stuff!

351
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:22,858
Ha, ha! Think again!
This is a present for Gou!

352
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:25,192
I'm gifting her the
entire five-book set!

353
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,192
Sosuke.

354
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:27,525
Right.

355
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:28,400
[MOMOTARO yelps]

356
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:29,942
My relative's kid likes insects.

357
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:32,233
I'm sure he'll get
more use out of it.

358
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:35,108
No! He doesn't love them
as much as I do!

359
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,442
[laughs]

360
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:38,733
I'm sure Gou will be happy

361
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:41,067
since she gets to
spend time with you.

362
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,983
Even if it is just
a short while.

363
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,858
Oh, he's more excited
and just won't admit it.

364
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:46,858
Am I right?

365
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:48,275
Shut up.

366
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:51,525
If you're done psychoanalyzing
me now, lend a hand.

367
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:54,108
[HARUKA]
So that apartment was where

368
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:55,483
your coach used to live.

369
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:56,858
Yeah.

370
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:59,525
He only taught swimming
at the district pool though.

371
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:01,775
I was out sick for a while
and when I came back,

372
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:03,233
he had quit.

373
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:05,983
[MAKOTO] Wonder what his
reasons for leaving were.

374
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,067
[MISAKI] Who knows?
I wanted to get better.

375
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,192
He said he'd teach me. It's not
fair, he just up and left!

376
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:14,108
Now I'll never learn
to swim faster.

377
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,817
And why do you
wanna swim faster?

378
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,317
[MISAKI] 'Cause I don't
want to lose to him.

379
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,525
Who's "him"?

380
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:22,483
A guy who was in my class.

381
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,900
He transferred out
at the winter break.

382
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:26,025
He had amazing speed,

383
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,400
and I could never
beat him, not once.

384
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:29,442
Just wait!

385
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:31,067
I'm gonna race
against him one day.

386
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,067
And this time, I'll win!
We made a promise!

387
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,025
We would meet at
an upcoming swim meet!

388
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:38,483
So we could swim together again!

389
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,233
[MAKOTO] Hey, kid.
What should we call you?

390
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:58,608
Oh, uh, I'm Misaki Kuramoto.

391
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:01,650
I see. I'm Makoto Tachibana.

392
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:04,983
[HARUKA] And I'm Haruka Nanase.
Nice to meet you.

393
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,400
Question.

394
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:09,858
You wouldn't happen to be
heading over to the pool?

395
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:11,233
Yeah.

396
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:14,442
Even with Coach gone,
I gotta train to get faster.

397
00:18:15,817 --> 00:18:17,733
When you swim, what
stroke do you use?

398
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:20,108
[MISAKI]
Uh? Me? The best one!

399
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:21,817
Free!

400
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,025
And one day, I'm gonna be
the fastest in the world!

401
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:28,775
In that case,

402
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,858
you think it'd be okay for us
to tag along with you?

403
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,067
Huh?

404
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,442
Look at him go!

405
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:42,525
He's a little rough, but the
kid definitely has talent.

406
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:43,692
That's obvious.

407
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:45,067
Just goes to show you
what a difference

408
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,858
a good coach can make.

409
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,275
Doin' pretty good.

410
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:56,900
Looks like you have
the basics down.

411
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:58,775
[MISAKI]
Yeah. Thanks.

412
00:18:58,858 --> 00:18:59,983
[MAKOTO]
But I'm noticing sometimes

413
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:01,900
you're tensing up
and breaking form.

414
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:04,692
Relax and you'll move faster.

415
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:07,442
Your recovery phase is
fantastic, just make sure

416
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:10,275
you don't bend your elbow
underwater too much.

417
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,733
[MISAKI]
Like this?

418
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,108
[MAKOTO] You got it! Let it
naturally enter the water.

419
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,317
[MAN A]
Who is that?

420
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,067
[MAN B]
Whoever he is, he's amazing!

421
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:29,983
Too cool! Is he
a friend of yours?

422
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,483
He swims front
crawl beautifully!

423
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,942
Who are you guys? Pro swimmers?

424
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:40,942
[laughs] It'd be nice to
swim together some day.

425
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:44,608
Of course, with your friend
who transferred, too.

426
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:46,150
[MISAKI]
Yeah.

427
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:51,067
[GOU]
There you are!

428
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,525
What're you doin' here so early?

429
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:56,317
I managed to finish all my
shopping ahead of schedule.

430
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,317
And I also picked up some
not-too-sweet cake for you!

431
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,108
Guess what we're going
to have for dinner!

432
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:04,358
You're favorite, steak!

433
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:06,400
Mom's going all out
while she's got you.

434
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:09,025
[RIN chuckles]
Doesn't sound like Mom at all.

435
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,650
[GOU] It's been so long.
You can't blame her!

436
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:14,275
Plus you'll be flying back
to Australia in no time.

437
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:16,858
I think she's allowed
to go a little overboard.

438
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:19,858
Did you finish packing up
everything at your dorm?

439
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,317
I did.

440
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,233
On that subject, did you
hear any news about Haru?

441
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,483
Whether he found a place or not?

442
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,192
If it's weighing
on your mind so much

443
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:30,608
why don't you just pick up
the phone and give him a call?

444
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:32,150
It's not like it
was bothering me.

445
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:34,108
I was just curious.

446
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,733
Plus, I'm sure he's fine
with Makoto there.

447
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:39,483
Yeah.

448
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:43,692
[GOU] You gotta admit,
it's kinda sad.

449
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:44,983
[RIN]
What?

450
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:46,983
[GOU] Just how everyone's
slowly separating.

451
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,150
Moving away.

452
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,442
[RIN] Ha, ha. What are
you talkin' about?

453
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,067
We're not driftin' away.

454
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,358
Everyone's setting off
on new journeys.

455
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:57,358
No matter where we go, our
hearts will stay connected.

456
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:59,650
Stronger than they've
ever been before.

457
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,150
[giggles]

458
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:02,525
[RIN]
What's so funny?

459
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:04,567
[GOU]
You, trying to act cool.

460
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,608
[RIN]
Shut up.

461
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:06,692
[GOU giggles]

462
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:13,900
Come on in, check it out.

463
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:16,442
This is the place I'm renting.

464
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,692
No furniture yet, but why
don't we rest a little?

465
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:20,983
Sounds good.

466
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:24,442
[MAKOTO] I really need
to buy some curtains.

467
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:26,317
We'll be pretty busy.

468
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:32,942
[MAKOTO]
Listen, Haru.

469
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,608
[HARUKA]
What is it?

470
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,025
[MAKOTO]
To be honest,

471
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:39,108
I started today feeling
completely unsure.

472
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:40,817
Not convinced I could
make the transition

473
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,442
to a brand new place.

474
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:46,483
But when we went
to the pool earlier,

475
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:49,442
and I was coaching Misaki,
I was reminded that

476
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:52,025
what I really wanna do,
what gives me purpose,

477
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:54,817
is teaching kids how
fun swimming can be.

478
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,233
Remember what you
told me in junior high?

479
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,692
How I need to just be myself?

480
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:00,983
This is it.

481
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:03,025
I don't know how far,
or where the path leads,

482
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:05,775
but I know I wanna
do the best I can.

483
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,233
And in my own way.

484
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:08,317
Good.

485
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,775
[MAKOTO]
Besides, just watching Misaki

486
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:13,192
reminded me of Rin
when he was that age.

487
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:17,108
And made me think of how hard
I need to be working, too.

488
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:19,358
Rin wasn't that
honest with himself.

489
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:21,733
[MAKOTO laughs]
I have to agree with you there!

490
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:26,025
[phone vibrates]

491
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:27,400
[KATSUMI]
All right, gents.

492
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:29,025
Here's the key to the apartment.

493
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:30,650
The unit hasn't
been cleaned yet,

494
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,317
but I think it'd be fine if
you went to just take a look.

495
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,317
Thanks, I appreciate it.

496
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,025
We heard the person
who used to live there

497
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:38,400
was a swimming coach.

498
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:41,067
Just out of curiosity,
what kind of person was he?

499
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,650
Well, I believe coaching
was a part-time job

500
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:45,442
because he was still a student.

501
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:47,567
Speaking of which, when he
came to return the key,

502
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,608
he accidentally left
his phone behind.

503
00:22:49,692 --> 00:22:51,483
He called to say he'd
come back to pick it up.

504
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,442
So, if two wanna wait
around a little while,

505
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,525
you could probably
end up meeting him.

506
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,358
What do ya think? Wanna say hi?

507
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,358
No thanks.

508
00:22:58,442 --> 00:22:59,525
Very well.

509
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:01,317
Kisumi's outta the office,
so you guys okay

510
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,233
lookin' at the apartment alone?

511
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:05,150
You can even borrow my car.

512
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:09,108
[MAKOTO]
Guess I'll have to get used to

513
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:10,733
all the cars everywhere.

514
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:12,483
Everything okay over there?

515
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,233
Busy streets make me nervous.

516
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:17,233
Look out! Car! Stop! Stopping!

517
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:18,733
[MAKOTO yelps]

518
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,483
[sighs] That was amazing.

519
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,150
It's gonna take some
time for me to adjust

520
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,233
to driving around these roads.

521
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:40,483
Wow. Katsumi said it
hasn't been cleaned,

522
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:42,483
but it looks great!

523
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,983
It's weird but I feel a kind
of connection to the person

524
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,108
who used to live here.

525
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:49,192
Me, too.

526
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:50,692
This is the one.

527
00:23:58,275 --> 00:23:59,983
[MAKOTO]
You know, since he was a student

528
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:01,442
and a part time coach,

529
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:04,567
I wonder if he swam
for the school.

530
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,983
[HARUKA]
Who knows?

531
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:08,192
[NAO]
Excuse me!

532
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:09,650
Huh?

533
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:10,983
[NAO]
I called earlier.

534
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:13,233
I'm the goof who left
his phone in your office.

535
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:16,525
Oh. Hey! He missed ya.

536
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:17,775
[NAO]
Awesome.

537
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:19,858
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't find it.

538
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:20,817
[KATSUMI]
If you ever need anything,

539
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,150
feel free to come back.

540
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,108
Sound good, Mr. Serizawa?

541
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:26,108
Thank you for everything.

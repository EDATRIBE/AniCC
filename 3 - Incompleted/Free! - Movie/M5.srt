1
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:07,817
[sighs]

2
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,817
[GOU]
You in there, Rin?

3
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,567
Do you need a hand unpacking?

4
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,942
No thanks, I'm good.

5
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:15,567
All that's left is the stuff
I'm taking to Australia.

6
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:19,608
Hi, Steve.

7
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:22,275
Somebody's put on
a few pounds, huh?

8
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:27,025
The cold shoulder, as usual.

9
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:30,025
[MIYAKO]
Rin! Gou! I made us tea!

10
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:40,608
[RIN] Hm? You brewed Japanese
tea to drink with cake?

11
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:42,525
They go well together.

12
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:43,858
Come on and give it a try.

13
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:46,483
It's only the latest fad
in the Matsuoka household.

14
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,567
--[RIN] Uh...
--[MIYAKO, GOU] Right?

15
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,150
[GOU] Mm! So delicious!
Can I have another slice, Mom?

16
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:54,733
[MIYAKO]
Sure, but don't blame me

17
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:56,192
if you end up
looking like Steve.

18
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:57,525
[GOU]
But everyone loves Steve!

19
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:59,817
[MIYAKO, GOU laugh]

20
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,317
[GOU]
I think I will have another.

21
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,692
[MIYAKO] You know, that's
exactly what the cat would say!

22
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,108
[GOU]
Mom!

23
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,442
[NITORI]
That concludes today's practice.

24
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:14,150
Great work!

25
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:15,192
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Sir!

26
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:17,233
[NITORI]
Morning practice is at 7am.

27
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:20,692
And don't forget to check your
personal training regimen.

28
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:22,317
That's all! Dismissed!

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,108
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Good work today!

30
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:28,983
[MOMOTARO]
Wow, Ai!

31
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:31,483
You sounded just like
a real captain today!

32
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,525
It was way cool!

33
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:36,525
[chuckles] C'mon,
it's no big deal.

34
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:38,108
I'm still just acting captain.

35
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:39,567
Not the way I see it!

36
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,608
In my eyes, you already own
the role of swim captain!

37
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:45,775
That's nice of you to say,
but more importantly...

38
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,692
"More important" what?

39
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:49,692
[NITORI] I want to give
something to Rin and Sosuke

40
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,192
since they're graduating.
I haven't decided what yet.

41
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,025
We were on a relay team
together after all.

42
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:58,608
Right behind ya! Like a present!

43
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:01,858
The latest and greatest
in swimsuits or goggle wear!

44
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,067
Those could both work,
but I was thinking

45
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,108
more along the lines
of something

46
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:06,733
no one would be expecting.

47
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:08,983
They'd totally be
surprised by that!

48
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:11,025
A stag beetle larva raising kit!

49
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:13,650
To clarify, not
something you'd want.

50
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,275
A gift Rin and Sosuke would--

51
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:17,400
[gasps] Wait a minute!

52
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:19,567
[PRIZE CLERK A] Step right up!
Greetings, young man.

53
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,358
You get one chance
for every five tickets.

54
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:23,900
You don't happen
to have any tickets

55
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:24,942
I could borrow, do ya?

56
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,442
Huh?

57
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:29,608
I think I received a few when
we were shopping earlier.

58
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:30,817
But we don't need the stag bee--

59
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,317
[MOMOTARO]
You don't have to worry!

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,692
'Cause I'm feeling super lucky!

61
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,858
I scored seven points on
a quiz we got back today!

62
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:39,400
Lucky number seven!

63
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,150
What were the most points
you could've scored?

64
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,192
[MOMOTARO]
One hundred! Your tickets, sir!

65
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:45,067
[PRIZE CLERK A]
Okay, you got one shot.

66
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:53,650
[yells] Stag beetle nursery!

67
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:56,442
No! I didn't get it!

68
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:58,900
Our first prize winner!

69
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:00,108
Congratulations!

70
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:02,400
You get two tickets
to stay at a hot spring!

71
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:03,900
Hot spring?

72
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:05,733
You did it, Momo!

73
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,150
[MOMOTARO]
I did?

74
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,567
[MINAMI]
So. White Day. What now?

75
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,858
Hang out here, what else?

76
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:13,900
Since we didn't get anything

77
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:16,192
for Valentine's Day
to begin with!

78
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:27,025
I need to stop delaying
and pack my stuff soon.

79
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:36,692
[MINAMI] ...I'm saying is, even
though we didn't get anything,

80
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:39,733
we should bring presents
to the girls' school anyway.

81
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:42,775
Boom. We create a revolution
and shake up the system.

82
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:44,733
I mean, it's the
least we can do.

83
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:46,067
Yo.

84
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,817
[IWASHIMIZU]
Hey, Yamazaki.

85
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,858
--[UOZUMI] 'Sup?
--[MINAMI] Yo.

86
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:49,983
Did somebody happen
to leave these

87
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,650
in my room by accident?
Any of you guys?

88
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,233
Whoa, we've got cookies here!

89
00:05:54,317 --> 00:05:55,317
Who're they from?

90
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,817
I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

91
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,442
Hold on. Let's take
a closer look.

92
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:03,233
Have they got writing on them?

93
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:05,650
[gasps] The cookies
spell out of a message

94
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,192
if you find the right order!

95
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:08,733
[MINAMI]
Brilliant!

96
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,942
[MOMOTARO] Looks like our plan
will go off without a hitch.

97
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,358
When he finally
solves the puzzle,

98
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,817
he'll find a surprise
hot springs vacation!

99
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,317
[UOZUMI]
Mecha salmon roe!

100
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,317
[MINAMI]
"The mecha salmon roe is inside

101
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,317
the morning crabs."
Is it a metaphor?

102
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,317
The key here is
Mecha Salmon Roe!

103
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Sounds difficult to
eat inside a crab.

104
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:29,858
No, you're missing the point!

105
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:31,817
We're talking about
Mecha Salmon Roe!

106
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,233
It doesn't really matter
if you can eat it or not!

107
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:37,483
"Mecha salmon"? Whatever
it is, sounds cool!

108
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,650
Hey, Momo.

109
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,733
Nothing about this
should be impressive.

110
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,942
And weren't you supposed
to make it obvious what order

111
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,275
the cookies should be placed in?

112
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:45,442
[gasps]

113
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,067
[NITORI]
I heard everything!

114
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,525
You! Leave the puzzle
solving to an expert!

115
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:52,650
Stand back, you might get hurt!

116
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,442
[NITORI]
This looks correct!

117
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:59,858
[SOSUKE] "The treasure is
inside the red shark's mouth."

118
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:02,858
"The treasure is inside
the red shark's mouth."

119
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:04,358
Obviously a hint to point us

120
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,233
in the direction
of the treasure!

121
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:07,983
[MINAMI]
But what's this "red shark"?

122
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,192
Now that I think about it,

123
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,067
there's that one kid,
Akai, in Judo Club.

124
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,233
Well, let's bring him here!

125
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:13,483
[MINAMI]
Wait, why?

126
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,817
Why would this guy have
a prize in his mouth?

127
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,650
[UOZUMI]
Mecha salmon roe.

128
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:20,567
Oh!

129
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,525
Could it maybe have something
to do with the giant statue

130
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,525
of the shark in
the courtyard? Huh?

131
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:26,150
That may be a good
place to look.

132
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,692
But it's not red, dude.

133
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,608
[MOMOTARO] Well, why don't we
take a look just to be sure!

134
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,900
Wow! Think I figured it out!

135
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:37,900
The color of the sunset is
sure turning the shark red!

136
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,983
Then the treasure must
be inside its mouth!

137
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:41,983
How? It's mouth's not open.

138
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,275
Something's buried.

139
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,483
[UOZUMI]
The mouth's shadow!

140
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,692
Clever as always, Yamazaki!

141
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,358
[SOSUKE]
Two tickets for a hot spring?

142
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,608
[BOTH]
Congrats, Sosuke!

143
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,483
So what is this?

144
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,983
[laughs] I went to the
shopping district with Ai

145
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,233
and won them in a
lottery! Awesome, huh?

146
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:16,692
Please accept them!

147
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:20,108
Okay.

148
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:21,733
[SOSUKE]
So now you're up to speed.

149
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:22,983
What do you wanna do?

150
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,983
Anago Hot Springs.

151
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:28,025
They went through all
the trouble so why not?

152
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,525
Although...

153
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:32,025
I'd kind of feel bad if it was
just the two of us going.

154
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:33,108
[MIYAKO]
We have tickets to stay

155
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:35,608
at the Anago Hot
Springs, you know.

156
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:38,567
I bought some from
the newspaper salesman.

157
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,567
Ta-dah! Why don't
you invite those

158
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,692
underclassmen of yours along?

159
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:59,483
Hello, hot springs!
Tatami mats, yahoo!

160
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:00,525
Life is wonderful! Yahoo!

161
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,775
Could you calm down?

162
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,775
How can anyone remain calm?

163
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:05,858
Let's put our bags away
and go sightseeing!

164
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:08,692
Oh, yeah! I heard
there're capybaras here!

165
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:10,233
And I'm gonna take
a photo of one

166
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,442
to make my brother jealous!

167
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,442
Wanna tag along?

168
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:19,692
Momo! If we see a capybara,
I'll take the picture.

169
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:21,025
[MOMOTARO]
Yahoo!

170
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:40,817
These hot spring buns
are so addicting!

171
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,150
How many of those
things have you eaten?

172
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,192
Look out. A capybara.

173
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:46,608
No way!

174
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:48,733
It is real!

175
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:51,692
You have to take a picture!
You promised me!

176
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:53,567
Come on, Ai! You're
in this photo, too!

177
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,192
Why do I have to go?

178
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:58,067
[RIN]
Ready? Say cheese!

179
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:01,942
[MOMOTARO] Next up, both of
you need to get a shot!

180
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,692
--[RIN] Uh--
--Onward! Hurry up!

181
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:05,275
And what if we don't want to?

182
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:07,692
We're here, so how
about just one?

183
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,275
Okay.

184
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:13,275
Why are you looking
so grim, Sosuke?

185
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:14,483
Give us a smile!

186
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,483
I'm gonna take the photo!

187
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,733
--Cut it out!
--[NITORI] Say cheese!

188
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:24,400
[NITORI]
You're good! I snapped it!

189
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:25,733
[RIN]
Ouch!

190
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:50,275
Hello!

191
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,858
My life has been incomplete
without this sword!

192
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:54,233
[whispering] Hey, Momo.

193
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:56,567
Even though we were trying
to give Rin and Sosuke

194
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,067
a relaxing get away, we ended up

195
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,483
coming along and
having fun, too.

196
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:03,108
Can you think of anything else
we could give them as a present?

197
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:05,983
As a matter of fact, how
about giving this to Rin?

198
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,483
I don't know if that's the sort
of thing he'd appreciate.

199
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,067
Aw! But he brought
me a back bommerang

200
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,692
as souvenir present
from Australia!

201
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:16,108
A wooden sword is what
he should get in return!

202
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,483
You haven't entirely
convinced me yet.

203
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:20,733
Fine, I'll buy it and
give it to Gou instead.

204
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:23,483
I'm kinda doubtful
she'd like it either.

205
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:24,567
[gasps]

206
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,192
[MOMOTARO]
Am... Am I hallucinating?

207
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:29,025
Or do I spy a capybara?

208
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:30,650
Rin! You have take
a picture for me!

209
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,108
It's an emergency!

210
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,608
[RIN]
Let-Let go of me!

211
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:37,400
Momo really looks like
he's having a good time.

212
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:40,900
Yeah.

213
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:48,150
[MOMOTARO] The capybara was
so cute, it nearly killed me!

214
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:49,817
[laughs]

215
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,692
[NITORI]
Who're they?

216
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,983
[RIN]
I recognize some of their faces.

217
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:59,525
They're the Sofukan
High School Swim Club.

218
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:00,858
[RIN]
They're champions.

219
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:02,483
Regulars at the nationals.

220
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,858
Are they here training?

221
00:12:03,942 --> 00:12:05,733
I'm going for a closer look!

222
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,483
[NITORI]
Don't go charging in!

223
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,775
Put the sword away.
We can't afford a fight!

224
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:17,275
[NATSUYA]
Attention.

225
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:20,150
Those of you who've been called,
go to the lobby in order.

226
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:22,150
Don't block the doors.

227
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,483
[SOFUKAN STUDENTS]
Sir!

228
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:35,858
[AMAKATA]
Take your marks.

229
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:47,733
[knocking]

230
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,025
Hey, filmmakers!

231
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:50,775
How are preparations
for the movie?

232
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:52,775
Anything you could use
our help working on?

233
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,233
Hey! Wait till
you see the props!

234
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,983
We brought snacks
if you're hungry.

235
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,608
Couldn't come at a better time!

236
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:01,608
Wait a sec. Wasn't
Rin stopping by?

237
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:02,900
He's at the hot springs.

238
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,025
Sosuke and some others
went along with him.

239
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,150
[REI] Hot springs?
That's out of character.

240
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,525
Yeah well, he said Nitori
and that Momotaro guy

241
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:10,692
were taking them
there as part of

242
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,525
a surprise graduation present.

243
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:15,400
What? That is so cool!

244
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:16,567
Well, Nagisa.

245
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,442
Might I suggest we give
our upperclassmen

246
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:20,775
a surprise gift for graduating?

247
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:21,858
We can't anymore.

248
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:23,567
You just ruined
the surprise element.

249
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,775
Oh, no!

250
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:25,775
[laughs]

251
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:28,150
[chuckles] Thanks,
but we're good.

252
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:31,608
However, maybe something for Rin
before he goes to Australia.

253
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:34,108
Let's put our heads together.

254
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,358
A gift for you.

255
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,817
Wow! Surprise Bread!

256
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,108
Drizzled with limited
edition mackerel miso cream!

257
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:43,775
[GOU]
You're so thoughtful.

258
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:45,983
Why don't we take a break?
I think we've earned it.

259
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:47,400
[NAGISA]
Pass me a strawberry milk!

260
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:48,983
[REI]
And I'll have a barley tea.

261
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,108
[MOMOTARO]
This looks super delicious!

262
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:55,983
Should we stop
staring and dig in?

263
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:56,608
Why not?

264
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:57,983
Wait! First.

265
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:01,900
I'd like to say a few words
before we start eating.

266
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:05,942
This trip was supposed
to be a gift thanking you

267
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,775
for everything you've
done and to celebrate

268
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:10,608
your graduation, but then
you invited us along

269
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:13,067
and we both truly appreciate it.

270
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,317
Maybe...

271
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,858
I felt guilty tagging
along at first, but now,

272
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:18,400
I'm happy the four
of us were able

273
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,233
to make this trip as a team.

274
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,442
I'll cherish our time together!

275
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:27,025
That was a 10.0 on the
serious scale, man!

276
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:29,442
I have something I would
like to add to that, Ai.

277
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:30,192
Cool?

278
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:31,442
[NITORI]
Uh, yes, sir!

279
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,442
You're still just
acting captain as of now,

280
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:36,900
but come April,
it will be official.

281
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:37,858
I'm counting on you.

282
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,858
Sir! You won't be disappointed!

283
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:42,150
I'll do my very best
to fill the large shoes

284
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:43,775
you'll be leaving
behind, Captain!

285
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:45,817
Now that might be an 11!

286
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,275
You gotta loosen up!

287
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:50,275
Then let's set aside the
formalities and enjoy this meal.

288
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:54,317
Uh, before we do, a toast!

289
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,567
Here's to you. Rin and Sosuke.

290
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,900
Thank you for all
your hard work.

291
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,275
[ALL]
Cheers!

292
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:16,025
Don't mind me.

293
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:17,525
Where'd Momo go?

294
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:20,067
[NITORI] Looks like he got
carried away and ate too much.

295
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,567
He said he'd come in
after he rested a bit.

296
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,442
So, um.

297
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:32,692
Have you seen Rin?

298
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:35,733
He said the heat was
making him feel dizzy.

299
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:39,567
Seems like the both
of 'em had too much fun.

300
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,067
If you don't mind me saying,

301
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,025
I'm glad, 'cause it looks like
you're having fun as well.

302
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:47,442
Last time I thought about
anything but swimming's

303
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,192
been too long.

304
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,108
Does the mind good
to relax with friends

305
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:52,733
every once in a while.

306
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:55,108
I mean, we wanted to
say thank you to Rin.

307
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:57,525
But I don't know if you
realize how grateful we are

308
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,733
for everything you've
done for us, Sosuke.

309
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:02,358
So I'm glad to hear
you're having a good time.

310
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:04,233
[SOSUKE]
There you go, all serious.

311
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:07,108
I know you'll be able
to swim again some day.

312
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:09,233
You love it too much to give up.

313
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:11,442
A big part of why I was
able to come this far

314
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,858
was because of all
your encouragement.

315
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:18,650
[NITORI] What you did
for me, I want to pass on

316
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,442
to everyone else from now on.

317
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,275
So please, even though
you've graduated,

318
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:25,358
come and visit Samezuka,
because you're always welcome.

319
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,442
And if you're interested,

320
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,525
we'd love for you
to teach us again.

321
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:31,817
Sure thing. It's a deal.

322
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:34,525
[MOMOTARO]
I can't believe them!

323
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:36,567
Leaving me behind was way mean.

324
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,858
[BOTH grunt]

325
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:39,608
Sorry. Uh--

326
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:41,650
Ah. Hey, I remember you.

327
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,150
Heh. You better!

328
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:46,817
Samezuka Swim Club, first
year, Momotaro Mikoshiba!

329
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,067
They call me the otter
from the Sea of Japan!

330
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,483
[USAMI] Hmph. Sofukan High
Swim Club, first year.

331
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:56,942
Usami Aoba! Alias, the capybara.

332
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,442
King of the rapids!

333
00:16:58,525 --> 00:16:59,400
Capybara?

334
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:00,733
Listen here!

335
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:03,067
That capybara plushie
you were holding earlier?

336
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,900
I've been looking for one.

337
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:05,983
That's too bad!

338
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,025
'Cause yours truly
got the last one!

339
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:09,567
You gotta gimme yours then.

340
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,067
First come, first serve!
Sorry, I can't help ya!

341
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,650
You callin' me slow?

342
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,692
[NITORI sighs]
What a nice b--

343
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,317
Whatever's the problem,
I'm sure we can work it out!

344
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,567
[MOMOTARO] Oh, you bet
we're gonna work it out!

345
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,733
I'm challenging the
"Capybara of the Rapids"

346
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:25,692
to a match over my capybara!

347
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:27,025
[shrieking]

348
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:30,733
[RIN moaning]

349
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:31,900
[SOFUKAN MEMBER C]
What's the matter?

350
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:33,108
[SOFUKAN MEMBER D]
Usami's having a match

351
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:34,358
with the Samezuka guys!

352
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:35,858
Seriously?

353
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:40,067
A match? Don't tell me!

354
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,317
[RIN]
Damn it!

355
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,608
Even though I'm here,
we're still outnumbered!

356
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:47,567
[yelling]

357
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,275
[yelling]

358
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:50,025
Now, Ai!

359
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:51,775
[grunts]

360
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,233
[SOFUKAN MEMBERS]
Whoa.

361
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,067
Victorious!

362
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,067
[BOTH laugh]

363
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,650
One more! Let's go
again, damn it!

364
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:03,317
Jeez, guys. I'm supposed
to be relaxing here.

365
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,567
[NITORI]
Are trying to get us killed?

366
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:10,567
[NATSUYA]
I take it you're a swimmer, too?

367
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,025
[SOSUKE]
Huh?

368
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:17,317
You're on the Sameuzka
Swim Team, huh?

369
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,983
I'm an alum of the
Sofukan team myself.

370
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:23,400
Appears one of our club members
is causing a scene in there.

371
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:32,692
[NATSUYA]
Did you hurt your shoulder?

372
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:37,483
[SOSUKE] My own fault. I did
too much reckless training.

373
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:42,525
So yes, I used to be a
swimmer. But now I'm not.

374
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:43,900
One of my friends
had an accident,

375
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:45,817
injured his eye,
and was forced to stop

376
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,983
competing for a while
because of it.

377
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,358
So, he's been
pouring his passion

378
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,650
into sports medicine at college.

379
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,775
For him, loving
swimming doesn't mean

380
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:55,108
he has to go to tournaments.

381
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:56,567
He knows there are
other ways to show

382
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,275
his love for the sport.

383
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:01,358
But still.

384
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:04,025
One day, I hope we'll
swim together again.

385
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:10,983
Ha. Sorry, you didn't ask
to hear all that, did ya?

386
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,442
Anyway, good luck
with everything.

387
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:29,317
[MOMOTARO snoring]

388
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,483
[SOSUKE]
Trouble sleeping?

389
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,108
[RIN]
Yeah, who wouldn't.

390
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:40,192
[MOMOTARO] Hey! Hands off him.
The capybara's mine.

391
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:44,108
Someone needs to
have a talk with him.

392
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:45,942
This was a nice vacation.

393
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,733
It's been a while since
I had this much fun.

394
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:51,025
Ditto.

395
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:52,608
I made some good
memories to take back

396
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,942
with me to Australia.

397
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:56,858
We only have Ai and Momo
to thank for that.

398
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:00,358
Listen. Sosuke.

399
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:01,900
What up?

400
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,192
--After this, what'll you...

401
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:06,358
--[MOMOTARO yells]
--After this, what'll you...

402
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:07,858
That's not a capybara!
That's an alpaca!

403
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:10,400
What the hell are
you dreaming about?

404
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:14,483
Well. What were you gonna ask?

405
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,400
Ah, not anything important.

406
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:19,317
Tomorrow, let's take a dip
in the hot springs.

407
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,733
Good night.

408
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,858
Okay. Good night.

409
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:37,817
[MOMOTARO]
That was the best!

410
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,983
Let's do this again sometime!

411
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,900
Some place that has alpacas!

412
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:44,358
You can see them anytime
you want at the zoo.

413
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:45,900
[MOMOTARO]
Hey! That reminds me.

414
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,733
I dreamt about alpacas
all last night!

415
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:53,442
[RIN]
Ah, a shrine. Wanna make a stop?

416
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:55,025
[NITORI]
Sure!

417
00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:59,442
[MOMOTARO] Ah! Guys! They're
selling charms! Charms!

418
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,150
No question, we're
buying something!

419
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,692
Whoa, so many to choose from!

420
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,733
Which one are you thinking
of getting, Sosuke?

421
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:12,108
None.

422
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:15,525
I know!

423
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,483
Listen, why don't we totally
get them some charms

424
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,983
as their goodbye present?

425
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,900
Hey, not a bad idea!

426
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:23,275
[laughs] I'll leave it
up to you to choose

427
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:26,108
the best one for Rin!
And I'll pick Sosuke's!

428
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:27,900
[NITORI]
Right. Which one?

429
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:30,900
For you, Rin. A gift.

430
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:32,733
Me? Really?

431
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,650
I love it, Ai. Thanks.

432
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:40,525
[laughs]

433
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:42,400
I chose the perfect one for you!

434
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:44,108
Bet I can guess.

435
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:48,733
[gasps]

436
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:16,108
[REI groans] Feels like we're
nowhere close to finishing.

437
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:18,983
I sure hope Rin
gets to wear this.

438
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:21,733
That could be difficult,
considering his schedule.

439
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:22,942
Agreed.

440
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:25,150
Like today he had to
drop back by Samezuka.

441
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:26,400
Why's that?

442
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:28,358
I thought he moved out
of the dorms already.

443
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:31,442
Apparently, he's helping
Sosuke pack up his stuff.

444
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:37,400
[RIN chuckles]
Got a lot of gifts, didn't ya?

445
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:38,358
[SOSUKE]
Guilty.

446
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,567
Wha...? What is this?

447
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,067
[SOSUKE]
A Mecha-Salmon Roe from Uozumi.

448
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,275
[RIN]
Okay...?

449
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:47,150
Transforms into a salmon.

450
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,233
Ah...

451
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:04,358
Anything the matter?

452
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:05,775
I'm fine.

453
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,858
I guess I have to win.
